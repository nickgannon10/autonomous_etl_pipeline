Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply

nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Anaplan, and Anaplan will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a
result of the Merger, Anaplan will cease to be a publicly traded company, all outstanding shares of Anaplan stock will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive $66.00 per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”) (except for any shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shares held in
the treasury of the Company, or shares held by stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”)), net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest thereon, and you will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a
stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their
shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described below under the caption “The Merger—

The Merger Agreement provides that Anaplan’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the time at which the Merger will
become effective (the “Effective Time”) will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly agreed in
writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and the holder of such equity award or as contemplated by the Disclosure Schedule:
Options
Each option to purchase shares of Anaplan common stock (each, a “Company Stock Option”) that is outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether unvested and unexercised (each, an “Unvested Company Stock
3Table of Contents
Option”) or vested and unexercised, including any Company Stock Options that become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
“Vested Company Stock Option”), and each Company Stock Option that would have vested according to its terms on the date of the Merger
agreement, on or prior to January 31, 2023 (each, an “Additional Vesting Company Stock Option”), will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law) equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, by which
the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option; and (2) the total number of shares of
common stock subject to such option. The cash right with respect to each Unvested Company Stock Option will be subject to the same continuous
service-based vesting requirement that otherwise applied to the Unvested Company Stock Option. Each Company Stock Option with an exercise
price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled without consideration.
For any Company Stock Options that are outstanding and subject to performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each a “Company Performance Option”), (A) the performance metrics of such Company Performance Option will be deemed achieved as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target levels of performance and (B) if the optionholder remains in
continuous service through the Effective Time, (x) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed a Vested Company Stock Option with respect
to one-third (1/3) of the shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed an Unvested Company Stock Option
with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company Stock Option to vest subject to
the optionholder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).
Restricted Stock Units
Each Company restricted stock unit award (each a “Company RSU”) that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether unvested (each, an
“Unvested Company RSU”) or vested, including any Company RSUs that become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Vested
Company RSU”), and each Company RSU that would have vested according to their terms as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, on or
prior to January 31, 2023 (each, an “Additional Vesting Company RSU”), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law) equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration; and (2) the total number of
shares of common stock subject to such award of restricted stock units. The cash right with respect to each Unvested Company RSU will be subject
to the same continuous service-based vesting requirement that otherwise applied to the Unvested Company RSU.
For any Company RSUs that are outstanding and subject to performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
“Company Performance RSU”), (A) the performance metrics of such Company Performance RSU will be deemed achieved as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target levels of performance and (B) if the RSU holder remains in continuous service
through the Effective Time, (x) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed a Vested Company RSU with respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares
subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed an Unvested Company RSU with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the shares
subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company RSU to vest subject to the RSU holder’s continued service with Parent or its
subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as
a stockholder. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending
that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they
existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
•
at the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a certain
amount in cash, as described in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards”;
7Table of Contents
•
Anaplan’s executive officers are expected to continue in their current positions following the Merger and receive continued benefits
under their respective employment agreements with Anaplan;
•
Anaplan has entered into severance and change in control agreements with certain directors and executive officers of Anaplan, which
shall survive consummation of the Merger; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of common stock held by our directors and executive officers as of the
Effective Time will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of common stock held by all other stockholders. For more information, see
the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Anaplan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights (Page 79)
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”).
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by
the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex D and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does
not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section
262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you
hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult
with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) continuously
are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal to Anaplan before the vote is taken on the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; and (iii) continue to
hold your shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will
result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this Proxy
Statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this Proxy Statement. If you hold your
shares of common stock through a bank, broker

or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.",16,17

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common stock in the Merger generally will result in the
recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger
and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States.
For more information, see the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of

On April 27, 2022, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Preliminary Proxy Statement filed on April 21, 2022, relating to the Merger, omitted
material information that rendered it incomplete and misleading. The lawsuit, filed as an individual action by a purported stockholder of Anaplan, is
captioned Ryan O’Dell v. Anaplan, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03427 (S.D.N.Y.). As a result of the alleged omissions, the lawsuit seeks to hold Anaplan and
its directors liable for violating Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and additionally seeks to hold Anaplan’s
directors liable as control persons pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks, among other relief, an order enjoining
consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger in the event it is consummated, and damages. Anaplan has not yet responded to the
complaints filed in the lawsuit. While Anaplan believes that the lawsuit is meritless, there can be no assurance that it will ultimately prevail in the
lawsuit. Additionally, similar lawsuits may be filed before the Special Meeting.",17,17

Under the Merger Agreement, Anaplan has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries not to, and shall (x) instruct and cause its and their
respective directors and officers, and shall (y) instruct their managers, employees, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and
other advisors and representatives (whom we collectively refer to as “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, among other things:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals”) or the making thereof to Anaplan or its stockholders;
•
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; or
•
take any action to render any provision of any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination” or other
similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or

any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in Anaplan’s organizational documents, in each case inapplicable to
any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted
thereunder, Anaplan shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been granted to any such person or
Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions).
Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, Anaplan may
provide information, and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with, a person regarding an Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Superior
Proposal (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals”) or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and not to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties. For more

13Table of Contents
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Anaplan?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Anaplan by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by stockholders and the
other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Anaplan, with Anaplan
continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Anaplan will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common
stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act,
and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $66.00 for each share of Anaplan common stock that
you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own one hundred (100)
shares of common stock, you will receive $6,600.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes and
without interest.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?
A:
The relationship of the Merger Consideration of $66.00 to the trading price of the common stock constituted a premium of approximately forty-six
percent (46%) to the volume weighted average price of Anaplan’s common stock for the five days ending March 18, 2022, the last trading day prior
to the date on which Anaplan publicly announced that it had entered into the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents that we refer to in this Proxy Statement
carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special
Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your Anaplan stock certificates to
the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates. You
should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your
stock certificates with your proxy card.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If
you sell or transfer your shares of Anaplan common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such
as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies
Anaplan in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you
14
Table of Contents
will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the
Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
Q:
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to be advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Anaplan and its stockholders, (2) approved and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, in accordance with
the requirements of the DGCL, (3) recommended that Anaplan’s stockholders approve the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
(4) resolved that the Merger Agreement shall be submitted to Anaplan’s stockholders for approval at a special meeting of Anaplan stockholders
duly held in accordance with the DGCL and the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and Amended and Restated
Bylaws.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of
the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of Anaplan common stock. Instead, Anaplan will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, (i) Anaplan will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$293,122,500 and (ii) Parent will be required to pay to Anaplan a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under
different specified circumstances (in each case as described in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees”).
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Anaplan common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone; or (3) vote via the online portal at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents
Q:
What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on
the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the subject matter.
In determining the outcome of a stockholder vote on these proposals, we may only consider affirmative votes and negative votes cast on the
proposals – abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered a vote cast affirmatively or negatively on a proposal and, accordingly, do not
affect the outcome of the vote for these proposals.
The failure of any stockholder of record to either (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) vote
through the online portal at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the
adjournment proposal and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
SEC rules require Anaplan to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger for purposes
of this advisory vote?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is certain
compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Anaplan’s named executive officers. For further detail, see the section
captioned “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a
condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Anaplan or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is
adopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger will or may be paid to Anaplan’s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve such
compensation.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Anaplan.
16
Table of Contents
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in
“street name.” In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect
to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or
other nominee.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Anaplan common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card (www.proxyvote.com);
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card (1-800-690-6903) and following the telephone prompts;
or
•
by virtually attending the Special Meeting and submitting your vote through the online portal.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Anaplan common stock, and
to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone or through the
online portal at the Special Meeting. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to virtually attend the Special Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Anaplan common stock by proxy. If
you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still submit your vote via the online
portal at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and submit your vote via the
online portal, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other
nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. Additionally, you should follow the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee for virtually attending the Special Meeting and submitting your vote
through the online portal.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote of your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if
you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
17
Table of Contents
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or
•
virtually attending the Special Meeting and submitting your vote via the online portal.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote. You should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee for virtually attending the
Special Meeting and submitting your vote through the online portal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy
to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Our Board of Directors has designated the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the proxy holders for the Special Meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet
or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some
or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting instruction card that
you receive.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, Anaplan may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. Anaplan intends to publish final voting
results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Anaplan files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. See the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the
exchange of Anaplan common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will result in you recognizing gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you received pursuant to the Merger and your adjusted tax basis
in the shares of common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Anaplan common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S.
Holder has certain connections to the United States.
You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger for you in light of your own
particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. A more complete
description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
What will the holders of Anaplan stock options and restricted stock units receive in the Merger?
A:
Each outstanding Company Stock Option to purchase shares of common stock that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested
or exercisable, including any Company Stock Options that become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company Stock Option
that would have vested according to its terms on the date of the Merger agreement, on or prior to January 31, 2023, will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash (less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law) equal to the product of (1) the excess,
if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option; and (2) the total
number of shares of common stock subject to such option. The cash right with respect to each Unvested Company Stock Option will be subject to
the same continuous service-based vesting requirement that otherwise applied to the Unvested Company Stock Option. Each Company Stock
Option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration per share will be cancelled without consideration at the
Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, any Company Performance Option, whether or not vested or exercisable (A) the performance metrics of such Company
Performance Option will be deemed achieved as of immediately prior to the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target levels of
performance and (B) if the optionholder remains in continuous service through the Effective Time, (x) such Company Performance Option shall be
deemed a Vested Company Stock Option with respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance Option
shall be deemed an Unvested Company Stock Option with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such
Unvested Company Stock Option to vest subject to the optionholder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1,
2023 and February 1, 2024).
Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, including any Company RSUs that become vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company RSU that would have vested according to their terms as in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement, on or prior to January 31, 2023, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (less all deductions
and withholdings required by law) equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration; and (2) the total number of shares of common stock
subject to such award of Company RSUs. The cash right with respect to each Unvested Company RSU will be subject to the same continuous
service-based vesting requirement that otherwise applied to the Unvested Company RSU.

Table of Contents
For any Company Performance RSUs that are outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, (A) the performance metrics of such
Company Performance RSU will be deemed achieved as of immediately prior to the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target levels
of performance and (B) if the RSU holder remains in continuous service through the Effective Time, (x) such Company Performance RSU shall be
deemed a Vested Company RSU with respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance RSU shall be
deemed an Unvested Company RSU with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested
Company RSU to vest subject to the RSU holder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1,
2024).
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the first half of 2022. However,
the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger
Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is completed, Anaplan stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that stockholders are
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid
on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section
262. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Anaplan stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the
advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
additional detail in this Proxy Statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex D to this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Do any of Anaplan’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Anaplan stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Anaplan
stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the
extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—
Interests of Anaplan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS",21,30
"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Proxy Statement, the documents to which we refer you in this Proxy Statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts.
You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as “predicts,” “plan,” “expects,” “focus,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “goal,” “target,” “estimate,” “potential,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “momentum,” “can,” “could,” “design,” “see,” “seek,” “forecast” and other
words of similar import. Stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to the following factors:
•
the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval or failure to satisfy the other conditions to the
completion of the Merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;
•
the failure by Parent to obtain the necessary equity financing set forth in the equity commitment letter entered into in connection with the
Merger;
•
the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Parent a termination fee of up to $293,122,500;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may have been or may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger Agreement;
•
risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption “The Merger –
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”);
•
the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful
execution of Anaplan’s current strategy as an independent company;
•
the possibility that Parent could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or the
sale of some or all of Anaplan’s assets to one or more as-yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value
than that available to stockholders in the Merger;
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Anaplan is unable to solicit other alternative proposals during the pendency of the
Merger;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and business generally;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
•
risks related to the Merger diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;
•
risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed; and
•
risks related to the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals from governmental authorities required in connection with the Merger
(including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that governmental authorities may deny
approval.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Proxy Statement are qualified by the information contained herein,
including (1) the information contained under this caption and (2) other information described from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. No
assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.
22Table of Contents
Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we make on related subjects as may be detailed in
our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices, located at 50 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA
94105, during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten (10) days before the Special Meeting. If our principal executive offices are closed
during regular business hours for health and safety reasons related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic during such period, the list of stockholders

Approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires a vote “FOR” the proposal by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Anaplan common stock as of the Record Date. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires a vote “FOR” the proposal by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or
negatively on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable to Anaplan’s executive
officers in connection with the Merger requires a vote “FOR” the proposal by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the subject
matter. In determining the outcome of a stockholder vote on these proposals, we may only consider affirmative votes and negative votes cast on the
proposals – abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered a vote cast affirmatively or negatively on a proposal and, accordingly, do not affect the
outcome of the vote for these proposals.
24Table of Contents
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on (i) any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting or (ii) the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because
the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares on such proposal. Each
“broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on (i) any proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting or (ii) the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Abstentions will be counted as “shares present” at the Special Meeting for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists, but shares held by
a bank, broker or other nominee for the beneficial owner thereof which provides no voting instructions will not be considered present for the purposes of
establishing a quorum.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of
their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that stockholders are entitled to have their
shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair
value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262. Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal to Anaplan before the vote is taken on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and (iii) continue to hold your
shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss
of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this Proxy Statement, and the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares of common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, broker or nominee.

are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.

common stock voting in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your
vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment
proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including proxies from stockholders who have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special
Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the
discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on
this proposal.

or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this Proxy Statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Anaplan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Anaplan’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these
compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of Anaplan’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and
previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy
statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Anaplan, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable
by Anaplan to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in
the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Anaplan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.””
Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding
on Anaplan, the Board of Directors, Parent or the named executive officers. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and
not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated our
named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to the underlying plans and agreements and the Merger Agreement.
Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable to Anaplan’s executive officers in connection with the
Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on this proposal.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Effect of the Merger,"Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Anaplan,
and Anaplan will continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, our common stock will no
longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as
we, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).
Effect on Anaplan if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Anaplan will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and
traded on NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not
completed, we expect that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks
related to the highly competitive industry in which Anaplan operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your
shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Anaplan Board will continue to evaluate and review Anaplan’s business operations,
strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such decisions and changes regarding such matters as are deemed appropriate. If
the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to the Anaplan Board will be offered or that Anaplan’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Anaplan will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of up to
$293,122,500. Parent will be required to pay to Anaplan a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under different
specified circumstances. For more information, please see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

In the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares owned by (i) Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) stockholders who are
entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder
(except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as
determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described below under the caption “Appraisal Rights”).

Background of the Merger",41,42
"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of its ongoing evaluation of Anaplan’s business, the Anaplan Board, together with senior management, regularly reviews and assesses
Anaplan’s strategic direction, financial performance and business plans with a view towards strengthening Anaplan’s business and identifying
opportunities to increase stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Anaplan Board has from time to time considered a variety of strategic
alternatives for Anaplan, including continuing as a standalone company, pursuing a transaction with a strategic or financial acquirer or initiating other
operational changes.
As part of this evaluation, in late November Anaplan management contacted Goldman Sachs following Anaplan’s announcement of its quarterly
results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 to receive input on possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan, including a request to prepare for an
upcoming strategic assessment for the Anaplan Board. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also held multiple discussions with management of Anaplan in
November and December of 2021 regarding possible strategic alternatives.
Starting in early December, Mr. Frank Calderoni, Chief Executive Officer of Anaplan, held discussions with Anaplan’s outside directors, including
Mr. Bob Beauchamp, lead independent director of the Anaplan Board, and Mr. Sandesh Patnam and Mr. Suresh Vasudevan, additional outside directors
on the Anaplan Board, to discuss the strategic direction of Anaplan. Mr. Calderoni and Mr. Vikas Mehta, Chief Financial Officer of Anaplan, also began
planning efforts regarding Anaplan’s strategic direction and its future operating plans and forecast.
Also starting in early December, following a decline in its stock price in late November, Anaplan received unsolicited outreach from various
financial acquirers, including Thoma Bravo and three private equity firms that we refer to herein as Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm B and
Private Equity Firm C, proposing that Anaplan consider a variety of potential transactions, including a potential investment or other strategic transaction.
During this same time period, Anaplan’s management and outside directors received unsolicited input from, and held meetings with, several of its
investors relating to various strategic and operational matters. Subsequently, during the period beginning in early December 2021 through February 9,
2022, members of Anaplan management met for introductory meetings with representatives of each of Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity
Firm B and Private Equity Firm C.
On December 6, 2021, Mr. Calderoni briefed the full Anaplan Board regarding recent strategic developments at Anaplan, including discussions with
individual outside directors and outreach from potential strategic and financial acquirers and investors, and informed the Board that the agenda of the
regularly scheduled meeting of the Anaplan Board on December 10, 2021 would be revised to discuss these matters and focus on a strategic assessment
of Anaplan.
On December 10, 2021, the Anaplan Board held a meeting, at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Anaplan’s outside legal counsel, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP (“Gunderson”), were present. The Anaplan Board met
to explore a broad range of possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan and to discuss overall shareholder input following Anaplan’s most recent quarterly
earnings announcement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an overview on the activist investor environment.
On December 16, 2021, Anaplan received a letter from Corvex Management L.P. (“Corvex”), an activist investor, noting Corvex’s view that Anaplan
should evaluate whether a sale of Anaplan would maximize stockholder value as compared with continuing its independent operations as a standalone
company.
On December 20, 2021, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting, at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Gunderson
and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), legal counsel to Anaplan, were present. The Anaplan Board met to evaluate whether to
explore possible strategic alternatives and to discuss the Corvex letter to Anaplan. After robust discussion, the Anaplan Board determined it
34Table of Contents
would be appropriate to evaluate various strategic alternatives, with a focus on which alternatives might maximize value for stockholders. The Anaplan
Board then approved the formation of an Advisory Committee of the Anaplan Board (the “Advisory Committee”), comprised of Anaplan Board members
Mr. Beauchamp, Mr. Patnam and Mr. Vasudevan, in order to enable the Anaplan Board to act more nimbly and swiftly in its consideration of strategic
alternatives and interactions with activist investors and potential counterparties to any potential strategic transactions, it being understood that formal
approval authority for any definitive agreements for any given strategic alternative would ultimately rest with the full Anaplan Board. The Anaplan Board
also discussed the need to retain a financial advisory firm experienced in dealing with activist investors. Anaplan had previously engaged Goldman Sachs
as a lead-left bookrunner for its initial public offering and subsequently requested Goldman Sachs’ advice in evaluating certain other financing and other
matters thereafter. Accordingly, the Anaplan Board was familiar with the general capabilities and reputation of Goldman Sachs and was aware that
Goldman Sachs also had an activism defense practice. The Anaplan Board then approved retaining Goldman Sachs for activism defense and directed
Anaplan management to contact Goldman Sachs in connection with this purpose as well as to discuss potential financial advisory services in connection
with other possible strategic alternatives.
On December 23, 2021, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of
Gunderson and Skadden were present to continue the discussions of the matters raised at the meetings of the Anaplan Board on December 10 and
December 20, 2021. The Advisory Committee discussed Anaplan’s response to recent unsolicited inbound interest from private equity firms with respect
to a potential acquisition of, or investment in, Anaplan and to activists that had acquired stakes in Anaplan. Mr. Calderoni noted that Anaplan had
contacted Goldman Sachs to advise Anaplan in engaging with activist investors and to receive input on possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan. The
Advisory Committee discussed a broad range of potential options available to Anaplan in light of the recent unsolicited inbound interest from private
equity firms and the letter Anaplan received from Corvex, including evaluating (i) Anaplan continuing its independent operations as a standalone
company, (ii) accepting a “private investment in a public company” or “PIPE investment”, potentially coupled with a share buyback, (iii) engaging in one
or more buy-side acquisitions, (iv) engaging in a merger of equals with another public company or (v) engaging in a process to evaluate a potential sale
of Anaplan. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management further discussed engaging one or more financial advisors in connection with evaluating
the various options available to Anaplan. The discussion focused on retaining Goldman Sachs and/or Qatalyst Partners in light of their strong
relationships with strategic and financial acquirers in the industry in which Anaplan operates and, in Goldman Sachs’ case, its historical relationship with
Anaplan. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management also determined that Anaplan management would begin working to prepare preliminary
financial projections with respect to Anaplan (the “Preliminary Projections”) to help evaluate Anaplan on a standalone basis relative to potential strategic
alternatives, including a potential sale transaction.
On December 28, 2021, Mr. Calderoni and other Anaplan representatives met with representatives of Corvex by telephonic conference.
Representatives of Corvex presented certain information comparing a valuation of Anaplan prepared by Corvex with certain of its peer companies, and
their view that Anaplan was presently undervalued. Representatives of Corvex outlined their views that Anaplan had two primary options available to it:
(i) remain as a standalone company, but engage in an operational reboot, which would be time-intensive and difficult to execute upon as a public
company; or (ii) engage in a full review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of Anaplan. Representatives of Anaplan and Corvex discussed
various potential next steps with respect to continued discussions with Corvex, including whether Corvex would be willing to enter into a non-disclosure
agreement with Anaplan to permit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex. Mr. Calderoni and other Anaplan representatives met
later that day with representatives of Sard Verbinnen & Co. (“Sard”), a leading public relations firm, Goldman Sachs, Skadden, and Gunderson to discuss
next steps, including receiving further direction from the Anaplan Board and Advisory Committee.
On December 31, 2021, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Gunderson
and Skadden present. The Advisory Committee met to discuss the
35
Table of Contents
status of the Preliminary Projections being prepared by Anaplan management and a timeline to present the Preliminary Projections to the Advisory
Committee and the Audit Committee of the Anaplan Board (the “Audit Committee”) prior to presenting the Preliminary Projections to the full Anaplan
Board. The Advisory Committee again discussed engaging both Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisors to Anaplan. The
Advisory Committee also discussed the December 28, 2021 telephonic conference with representatives of Corvex. Mr. Calderoni updated the Advisory
Committee on the proposed courses of action that Corvex noted and the possibility of Corvex entering into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan to
permit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex. The Advisory Committee considered various next steps in light of views expressed
by Corvex and potential contingencies with respect to additional requests Corvex might make of Anaplan.
On January 3, 2022, Mr. Calderoni and other members of Anaplan management met with representatives of Goldman Sachs to review the then
current Preliminary Projections prepared by management, which had been prepared based on the financial projections Anaplan updates on an annual
basis for the upcoming three to five fiscal years, but had been extrapolated by management to project Anaplan’s operations based on certain key metrics
for the upcoming ten fiscal years. These Preliminary Projections included a “base case” set of financial projections based on a set of assumptions and
estimates that management believed were most reasonable and likely to occur, as well as alternative sets of financial projections, one based on a more
optimistic series of assumptions and estimates related to future results and another based on a more conservative series of assumptions and estimates
related to future results. As described in greater detail in the section below captioned “The Merger—Certain Financial Projections”, these alternative
sets of financial projections were not used or relied upon by the Anaplan Board in its decision to approve the Merger or make its recommendation to
stockholders, nor were they used or relied upon by Goldman Sachs or Qatalyst Partners in connection with preparing their financial analyses, nor were
they shared with potential acquirers of Anaplan as part of the strategic review process described below.
On January 4, 2022, the Advisory Committee met, joined by the members of the Audit Committee, as well as with members of Anaplan management
and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Gunderson and Skadden. Members of Anaplan management presented the Preliminary Projections and the
various Anaplan performance scenarios included in the Preliminary Projections and provided an update on previous discussions with Corvex.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its preliminary financial analyses of Anaplan based on the Preliminary Projections with the Advisory
Committee and members of the Audit Committee present. Skadden and Gunderson then reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection
with its evaluation of a strategic review process and any response to Corvex. The Advisory Committee discussed various factors that would help to
clarify the Preliminary Projections for review by the Anaplan Board, and other next steps, including representatives of Goldman Sachs identifying
potential strategic and private equity acquirers that might have an interest in acquiring Anaplan and the financial capability to consummate an
acquisition.
Also on January 4, 2022, Mr. Calderoni and other representatives of Anaplan met by telephonic conference with representatives of Corvex,
continuing previous discussions regarding the investment Corvex had made in Anaplan common stock. Subsequently in January 2022, members of
Anaplan management, Mr. Beauchamp and Anaplan’s outside legal advisors engaged in various telephonic conferences with representatives of Corvex.
They discussed (i) Corvex’s investment in Anaplan, (ii) Corvex’s views on potential options to enhance stockholder value, (iii) the possibility of Corvex
entering into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan to permit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex and (iv) Corvex’s request
to speak with Mr. Beauchamp and Anaplan’s outside financial advisors. In addition, Corvex indicated it was nearing the filing threshold with respect to
which Corvex would be required to file a Schedule 13D with respect to its investment in Anaplan. Throughout this period, Corvex declined the
opportunity to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan.
On January 6, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives from Gunderson and
Skadden were present. The Anaplan Board reviewed various options available to Anaplan, including with respect to Anaplan’s standalone long-term
operating plan and a potential
36
Table of Contents
strategic review process. Skadden reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection with reviewing the Preliminary Projections, the
Anaplan Board’s evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and the engagement with Corvex. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then joined the
meeting and reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Anaplan with the Anaplan Board. Anaplan management reviewed the Preliminary Projections
and the various performance scenarios included in the Preliminary Projections with the Anaplan Board.
Also on January 7, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Gunderson reviewed with the Anaplan Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic review
process, including any potential strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Anaplan. Anaplan management next discussed with the Anaplan Board the
Preliminary Projections and answered additional questions with respect thereto. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of
potential strategic and private equity acquirers of Anaplan and an overview of the differences between strategic and private equity acquirers. The
Anaplan Board discussed with management various alternatives under consideration, including (i) Anaplan continuing its independent operations as a
standalone company, (ii) accepting a “private investment in a public company” or “PIPE investment,” potentially coupled with a share buyback, (iii)
engaging in one or more buy-side acquisitions, (iv) engaging in a merger of equals with another public company and (v) engaging in a process to
evaluate selling Anaplan. The Anaplan Board then discussed the overview from the representatives of Goldman Sachs on the differences between
strategic and private equity acquirers, including the potential willingness and ability of strategic acquirers to reach higher valuations than private equity
acquirers. The Anaplan Board then considered the prospect of commencing a strategic review process in which it would focus initially on those potential
strategic acquirers that might be most able to make an attractive offer for Anaplan, and then potentially explore outreach to potential private equity
acquirers. The Anaplan Board noted that this approach would allow the Anaplan Board to evaluate whether any transaction that emerged would be in the
best interests of Anaplan and its stockholders. After the representatives of Goldman Sachs left the meeting, the Anaplan Board also discussed the
possibility of engaging a second financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners, to obtain an additional viewpoint on Anaplan’s financial and trading performance
relative to certain peer groups and the market generally, analyst perceptions of Anaplan, the market environment, and potential financial and strategic
acquirers of Anaplan from a financial advisor considered by Anaplan management to have significant experience with, and deep knowledge of, the
industry in which Anaplan operates and its participants. The Anaplan Board unanimously authorized Anaplan’s management to initiate such a strategic
review process, focusing first on potential strategic acquirers, and then potentially later evaluating private equity acquirers. The Anaplan Board also
instructed management to formally engage Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners as financial advisors to Anaplan for the purpose of assisting the
Anaplan Board with respect to a strategic review process, subject to disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with respect to any potential acquirers.
Goldman Sachs subsequently provided a relationship disclosure letter disclosing potential conflicts with respect to the potential acquirers in the
connection with the strategic review process, such that the Anaplan Board was aware of any such potential conflicts of interest at the time that the
Anaplan Board approved the sale transaction with Thoma Bravo. In addition, Qatalyst Partners subsequently provided relationship disclosure letters
confirming that it did not have potential conflicts of interest that would limit it from fulfilling its responsibilities as one of Anaplan’s financial advisors.
On January 11, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. The Anaplan Board met to further formalize the outreach plan with respect to the strategic
review process it approved on January 7, 2022. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Anaplan Board a list of seven
potential strategic acquirers that may have interest in Anaplan and financial capability to consummate an acquisition and an illustrative timeline for the
process. The Anaplan Board discussed the likelihood of receiving bids in connection with a strategic review process and the negotiating posture of
Anaplan. The Anaplan Board discussed delaying outreach to two of the potential strategic acquirers because Anaplan was currently in the process of
negotiating commercial agreements with them. The Anaplan Board then approved
37
Table of Contents
outreach to the seven potential strategic acquirers, including on a delayed basis for the two potential acquirers with which Anaplan was currently
negotiating commercial agreements.
On January 12 and January 13, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners initiated outreach to the five potential strategic
acquirers as directed by the Anaplan Board. Thereafter, and through February 1, 2022, members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Qatalyst Partners continued to engage with the initial five potential strategic acquirers. Three of those five strategic acquirers, which we refer
to as Strategic Firm A, Strategic Firm B, and Strategic Firm C also entered into non-disclosure agreements with Anaplan during this period, only one of
which included a standstill provision, which standstill provision included an exception allowing for the submission of private acquisition proposals to the
Anaplan Board and a fallaway provision terminating the standstill in the event Anaplan announced a transaction with the applicable strategic acquirer.
During this period, in addition to the management presentations and other meetings detailed below, representatives of Anaplan management also
responded to certain due diligence requests from these parties focused on operational, product, and financial diligence. One of the initial five strategic
acquirers indicated that it did not wish to consider evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan and did not enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan.
On January 18, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and a representative of Gunderson
present. The Advisory Committee met to discuss the strategic review process and recent conversations with Corvex. Mr. Calderoni discussed the
outreach to date and the levels of engagement from the potential strategic acquirers. The Advisory Committee then discussed whether the introduction
of certain potential private equity acquirers could enhance the competitive dynamic of the process and potentially motivate strategic acquirers to make
attractive bids. The Advisory Committee also discussed recent conversations with Corvex regarding the possibility of entering into a non-disclosure
agreement with Anaplan and the likelihood of Corvex agreeing to do so and the possibility that Corvex might disrupt the strategic review process.
On January 20, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm A to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
On January 21, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm B to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
On January 25, 2022, representatives of Anaplan held a product demonstration with representatives of Strategic Firm A.
On January 28, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm C to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
Also on January 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives of Strategic
Firm B to discuss feedback from Anaplan’s management presentation and next steps with respect to the potential acquisition of Anaplan.
On February 1, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting during which members of Anaplan management and representatives from
Gunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Calderoni summarized discussions to date with the five potential strategic acquirers (including Strategic Firm
A, Strategic Firm B and Strategic Firm C), but noted that the process was moving more slowly than anticipated. Mr. Calderoni also noted that the
commercial agreements with one of the potential strategic acquirers the Anaplan Board had previously authorized outreach to had been completed and
the other would be shortly, allowing for their inclusion in the strategic review process. The Anaplan Board then considered authorizing further outreach
to an initial group of five potential private equity acquirers, including Thoma Bravo and Private Equity Firm B, and two other private equity firms, which
we refer to as Private Equity Firm D and Private Equity Firm E, that might be most interested
38
Table of Contents
in acquiring Anaplan, based on their investment and acquisition history with technology companies, and would have the financial capacity to
consummate a transaction, based on the size of the investment funds raised by them. The Anaplan Board also considered an additional three potential
private equity acquirers to be added to the strategic review process with similar capabilities (which included Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm
C), but who might have less strong interest in acquiring Anaplan than the initial group of five potential private equity acquirers. The Anaplan Board then
approved outreach to the five initial private equity acquirers, including Thoma Bravo. Messrs. Calderoni and Beauchamp each reported on their recent
discussions with Corvex, and discussed with the Anaplan Board the likelihood of various next steps that Corvex might take, including with respect to a
potential Schedule 13D filing with respect to Corvex’s ownership interests in Anaplan.
On February 1, 2022 and through February 23, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners began outreach to the two additional
potential strategic acquirers and the initial five private equity acquirers authorized by the Anaplan Board, including Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm B,
Private Equity Firm D, and Private Equity Firm E. One of the two potential strategic acquirers Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners had reached out to
following the Anaplan Board’s special meeting on February 1, 2022, which we refer to a Strategic Firm D, entered into a non-disclosure agreement with
Anaplan, which agreement did not include a standstill provision. However, after an initial meeting with Anaplan’s management, the other potential
strategic acquirer indicated that it would not be considering a potential transaction with Anaplan and did not enter into a non-disclosure agreement with
Anaplan. Additionally, each of Strategic Firm A, Strategic Firm B and Strategic Firm C and the fifth strategic acquirer contacted following the Anaplan
Board’s special meeting on January 11, 2022 (which had an initial meeting with Anaplan’s management, but had not entered into a non-disclosure
agreement with Anaplan), subsequently indicated during this period that they were not interested in an acquisition of Anaplan. During the period from
February 1, 2022 through February 9, 2022, Thoma Bravo and Private Equity Firm B, Private Equity Firm D, and Private Equity Firm E each entered into
non-disclosure agreements with Anaplan, each of which included a standstill provision, which provision included an exception allowing for the
submission of private acquisition proposals to the Anaplan Board and a fallaway provision terminating the standstill in the event Anaplan announced a
transaction with the applicable potential private equity firm. During the period from February 1, 2022 and through February 23, 2022, in addition to the
management presentations and other meetings detailed below, representatives of Anaplan management also responded to certain due diligence requests
from these parties focused on operational, product, and financial diligence. One of the initial five private equity acquirers indicated that it did not wish to
consider evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan and did not enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan.
On February 2, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
Also on February 2, 2022, Mr. Calderoni held a telephonic conference with representatives of Strategic Firm C to discuss Strategic Firm C’s interest
in acquiring Anaplan.
On February 8, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Private Equity Firm B to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
On February 9, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Private Equity Firm E to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.
On February 10, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Private Equity Firm D to provide Anaplan’s management
presentation.
On February 11, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm D to provide Anaplan’s management presentation.

cash, and Private Equity Firm E, with an initial bid of $51.00 per share in cash. Private Equity Firm B did not submit a bid on March 8. Thoma Bravo’s bid
also indicated that it would be prepared to commit to fully finance the Merger Consideration payable in the transaction with equity from Thoma Bravo’s
investment fund, and had requested exclusivity to permit Thoma Bravo to finalize its diligence and enter into a definitive agreement with Anaplan within a
week following its bid submission on March 8, 2022. In addition to indicating the ability to sign a definitive agreement within a week, as opposed to the
three weeks or longer timelines proposed by each of the other bidders, Thoma Bravo’s bid was the only bid received that did not require additional equity
partners. Each of the bids from Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C and Private Equity Firm E indicated that they would require equity partners as
well as debt financing in connection with the transaction.
On March 9, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,

Table of Contents
Equity Firm E. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management discussed convening the Anaplan Board on March 10, 2022 to consider the bids
received from the potential private equity acquirers in more detail.
Also on March 9, 2022, Private Equity Firm B, which had remained in the process but did not submit a bid on March 8, 2022, indicated that it would
not be further evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan.
On March 10, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Gunderson and Skadden present. The Advisory Committee discussed the meeting that took place among representatives of Anaplan and Corvex on
March 7, 2022 in which Corvex and Sachem Head had indicated that they would be filing a Schedule 13D no later than March 17, 2022. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs reviewed potential responses to the two director nomination requests and other proposals made by Corvex and Sachem Head. The
Advisory Committee determined to recommend that the Anaplan Board seek to minimize the potential disruption that Corvex and Sachem Head could
cause on the ongoing strategic review process.
Later on March 10, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs, Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Mehta reviewed the final financial projections package (collectively the “Financial
Projections”) which had been prepared by Anaplan’s management team. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners provided an overview
of Anaplan’s process in approaching fourteen parties that were viewed as having an interest in acquiring Anaplan and the financial capacity to
consummate an acquisition to take part in the strategic review process, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners initially approaching
potential strategic acquirers and then subsequently approaching potential private equity acquirers to seek to solicit credible bids to acquire Anaplan.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reported that ten potential acquirers meaningfully engaged in preliminary diligence and in
various discussions with Anaplan management, with four potential strategic acquirers and six potential private equity acquirers having received
management presentations. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners noted that all but one potential strategic acquirer, Strategic Firm D,
had indicated that it would not further consider evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan, and that Strategic Firm D had not submitted a bid when other first
round bids were received and had still not submitted a bid as of the time of the meeting. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners noted
that Thoma Bravo’s offer likely had more closing certainty insofar as Thoma Bravo did not require an additional equity partner or debt financing, and
since Thoma Bravo indicated it could execute a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction in a week. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Qatalyst Partners presented certain preliminary valuation analyses based on the Financial Projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst
Partners also shared their perspective that, for the private equity bidders that had submitted bids that included a range of values, they would likely
require significant additional time and diligence work to finalize their views on valuation and as such, there was significant uncertainty as to whether a
more concrete offer at the higher end of their indicated ranges would ultimately be a realistic possibility. Representatives of Gunderson also reviewed with
the Anaplan Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic review process, including a potential sale of Anaplan. Representatives of Gunderson
also reviewed the timing and procedural steps involved in the acquisition process. The Anaplan Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Qatalyst Partners to indicate to Thoma Bravo that its proposal did not reflect the highest possible price of the bids received and that if Thoma Bravo
wanted to purchase Anaplan, it would need to improve its offer.
Later on March 10, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives from Thoma
Bravo to relay that Thoma Bravo’s proposal did not include the highest possible price as compared to other proposals received, and if it was interested in
purchasing Anaplan, it needed to improve its offer.
On March 11, 2022, representatives of Anaplan held a product overview diligence session with representatives of Strategic Firm D.

Also on March 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo held a telephonic conference with representatives of Qatalyst Partners to discuss its bid.
After discussing various concerns, the representatives of Thoma Bravo relayed that its “best and final” offer was $66.00 per share in cash (which offer
continued to provide for full funding of the Merger Consideration via equity if debt financing was unavailable) and requested that Anaplan seek to
execute a definitive agreement on the one-week timeline proposed by Thoma Bravo.
Later on March 11, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners provided an update on
their recent discussions with Thoma Bravo and the “best and final” offer price Thoma Bravo made of $66.00 per share in cash. The Anaplan Board
discussed the offer, the likelihood of other potential acquirers in the process exceeding the price offered by Thoma Bravo and various considerations
relating to Thoma Bravo’s proposed timeline and price. After robust discussion, the Anaplan Board determined to direct Anaplan management, Goldman
Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Anaplan’s legal advisors to prioritize discussions with Thoma Bravo and see whether an acceptable definitive agreement
could be reached with Thoma Bravo at the “best and final” offer price of $66.00 per share. Representatives of Skadden and Goldman Sachs then reviewed
with the Anaplan Board Mr. Calderoni’s discussions with Corvex and Sachem Head, the director nomination proposals and other requests made by
Corvex and Sachem Head and the fact that Corvex and Sachem Head had entered into an advocacy agreement that would cause them to become a
“group” for SEC purposes and would require them to make a Schedule 13D filing by March 17, 2022 at the latest. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
reviewed with the Anaplan Board potential strategies Anaplan could consider in responding to the various requests with respect to the director
nomination and other proposals made by Corvex and Sachem Head. The Anaplan Board determined to seek to minimize the potential disruption that
Corvex and Sachem Head could cause on the ongoing strategic review process. In executive session, the Anaplan Board also discussed Anaplan’s
regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle, and given the possibility that Anaplan may enter into a definitive agreement with a prospective
acquirer, the Anaplan Board discussed the advisability of delaying the regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle.
Later on March 11, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Anaplan Board met to evaluate Anaplan’s regularly scheduled equity award refresh
grant cycle, and to explain to Mr. Calderoni that given the possibility that Anaplan may enter into a definitive agreement with a prospective acquirer, the
Compensation Committee had determined to delay the regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle.
Also on March 11, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reached out to each of Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm
C, and Private Equity Firm E. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners informed Private Equity Firm E that its bid of $51.00 per share was
not competitive with other bidders in Anaplan’s strategic review process. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners relayed to Private
Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C that Anaplan would allow each of Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C to team up with another
potential private equity acquirer consistent with their request to do so in their bid letters (but instructed each such party not to independently seek such
a potential partner just yet while Anaplan organized additional diligence materials to open up to Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C during
the week of March 21, 2022).
On March 12, 2022, Messrs. Calderoni and Beauchamp and representatives of Corvex and Sachem Head met to discuss the nominations made by
Corvex and Sachem Head to the Anaplan Board and the other proposals made by the investors, among other topics, and resolved to stay in touch with
respect to a possible settlement agreement or coordination with respect to any future Schedule 13D filing or other public announcements to be made with
respect to the activists’ ownership interests in Anaplan.
Also on March 12, 2022, Anaplan opened a comprehensive virtual data room to begin sharing detailed financial, operational and legal diligence
materials and the first draft of the Merger Agreement with Thoma Bravo and its advisors. From March 12, 2022 through March 20, 2022, additional
diligence materials
44
Table of Contents
were exchanged and several diligence calls and other discussions relating to a potential sale of Anaplan to Thoma Bravo were held with members of
Anaplan management, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Gunderson, and representatives of Thoma Bravo and Thoma Bravo’s
outside advisors, including Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), Thoma Bravo’s outside legal counsel.
On March 15, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with Strategic Firm D to inform it that the
process had accelerated with a different potential acquirer and that Anaplan may engage in an alternative transaction with such potential acquirer if the
potential strategic acquirer did not promptly submit a bid. Strategic Firm D, the sole remaining potential strategic acquirer, did not subsequently engage or
offer a bid with respect to an acquisition of Anaplan.
On March 16, 2022, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and initial drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty
to Gunderson. Open issues in the revised draft covered a variety of topics, including the treatment of unvested equity awards, the sizes of the termination
fee payable by Anaplan in certain circumstances and the reverse termination fee payable by Sponsor in certain circumstances, and remedies available to
the parties in the event of breach.
On March 17, 2022, Gunderson discussed material issues raised in Kirkland’s draft of the Merger Agreement with members of Anaplan
management, and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Skadden. Gunderson then sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement,
Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty to Kirkland.
Also on March 17, 2022, Corvex and Sachem Head made their respective Schedule 13D filings with respect to their ownership interests in Anaplan.
On March 18, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a regularly scheduled meeting of the Anaplan Board, at which members of Anaplan management were
present. Among other matters discussed at the meeting, the Anaplan Board approved the annual operating budget which contained financial projections
consistent with the Financial Projections but with only a single year of operations forecast. Representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners,
Gunderson and Skadden were present for a portion of the meeting. During this portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst
Partners updated the Anaplan Board on subsequent activities of management, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners and Anaplan’s legal counsel. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners described the prioritized diligence activities Anaplan had engaged in with Thoma Bravo, and the
subsequent outreach representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners engaged in with Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C, Private
Equity Firm E, and Strategic Firm D. Representatives of Gunderson updated the Anaplan Board with respect to the status of ongoing negotiations with
Thoma Bravo and other status updates with respect to the transaction process. Representatives of Skadden updated the Anaplan Board with respect to
the additional discussions amongst Anaplan management and representatives of Corvex and Sachem Head and the Schedule 13D filings made by Corvex
and Sachem Head on March 17, 2022. After representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Skadden left the meeting, the Anaplan Board
discussed the treatment of equity awards in the Merger Agreement, and the fact that Anaplan’s regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle was
delayed due to the pending discussions with potential prospective acquirers. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Thoma Bravo’s offer was a
“best and final” offer at a price for $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock, and in light of that fact, the Anaplan Board believed that it would be
appropriate for management to engage with Thoma Bravo to discuss appropriate mechanisms to facilitate employee retention during the interim period
between signing of a definitive agreement and closing of a transaction, including making regularly scheduled equity refresh grants and providing for
partial acceleration of unvested equity awards upon closing.
Later on March 18, 2022, Kirkland sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty to Gunderson.

Partners to utilize the Financial Projections for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo.

including with the equity awards receiving the treatment as provided in the section below captioned “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—
Outstanding Equity Awards”.
Later on March 20, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs, Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Calderoni updated the Anaplan Board with respect to Anaplan management’s
interactions with Thoma Bravo throughout the week and the progress towards agreeing to a proposed final merger agreement to be entered into with
Thoma Bravo. Following the discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Anaplan Board its financial analyses of the proposed
transaction and rendered an oral opinion to the Anaplan Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the
Anaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash
per share of Anaplan Common Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to such holders (see the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Opinions of Anaplan’s Financial
Advisors—Opinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan” for further details). Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then presented certain
financial analyses with respect to the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo and rendered its opinion orally, that, as of the date thereof and based upon
and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its opinion, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan
Common Stock to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common
stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (see the section of this Proxy Statement
captioned “The Merger—Opinions of Anaplan’s Financial Advisors—Opinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan” for further details).
Representatives of Gunderson then reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection with the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo
and reviewed the material terms of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty. The Anaplan Board evaluated its reasons for,
and certain risks and other potentially negative factors relating to, the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo as described under the section of this
Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger— Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.” After additional discussions of the
proposed transaction and the matters summarized for the Anaplan Board at the special meeting, the Anaplan Board unanimously (i) determined that the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to be advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
Anaplan and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without
limitation, the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (iii) recommended that Anaplan’s stockholders approve the Merger and the

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors, at a meeting held on March 20, 2022, unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to be advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Anaplan and its stockholders, (2) approved
and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, in accordance with
the requirements of the DGCL, (3) recommended that Anaplan’s stockholders approve the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (4)
resolved that the Merger Agreement shall be submitted to Anaplan’s stockholders for approval at a special meeting of Anaplan stockholders duly held
in accordance with the DGCL and the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and Amended and Restated Bylaws.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of
the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time
of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Reasons for the Recommendation of the Anaplan Board
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Anaplan Board consulted with Anaplan’s senior management,
its financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, and legal advisors at Gunderson and Skadden and considered, analyzed and relied upon a
wide and complex range of factors. Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Anaplan Board
unanimously determined that entering into the Merger Agreement would yield the highest value reasonably available for Anaplan’s stockholders and is
advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Anaplan and its stockholders.
In making its determination and recommendation of the Merger to Anaplan’s stockholders, the Anaplan Board considered a number of factors,
including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
Anaplan’s Financial Condition and Prospects. The Anaplan Board considered the current and historical financial condition and results of
operations of Anaplan, as well as the strategic objectives and future prospects for Anaplan if it were to remain an independent company. The
Anaplan Board reviewed Anaplan’s current financial operating plan, including the risks and uncertainties associated with executing upon and
achieving the plan. The Anaplan Board believes, on this basis, that the Merger Consideration fairly reflects Anaplan’s intrinsic value, including its
potential for future growth in light of the risks and uncertainties faced by Anaplan.
47Table of Contents
Ability to Remain Independent. The Anaplan Board considered the ability of Anaplan to remain independent and the risks and costs associated
with doing so, including:
•
Industry Risks. The Anaplan Board considered relevant industry risks, including the potential for reduced growth rates as the
software as a service (SaaS) industry matures.
•
Competitive Risks. The Anaplan Board considered Anaplan’s competitive position in the SaaS industry, including current and
potential future competition from larger and better funded companies which might have competitive advantages from their broader
commercial scope and economies of scale in pricing, and other competitors with less advanced product offerings catching up to
Anaplan.
•
Execution Risks. The Anaplan Board considered execution risks facing Anaplan, including go-to-market execution challenges that
Anaplan may face.
Complete Company Sale. The Anaplan Board believed that a 100% acquisition of the company was most likely to maximize value for Anaplan
stockholders as compared with remaining an independent company when taking into account the aforementioned risks and costs. The Anaplan
Board also considered the fact that certain significant investors in Anaplan had privately expressed their view to Anaplan that a 100% acquisition
of Anaplan would best maximize the value of Anaplan to all of Anaplan’s stockholders.
Results of Process Conducted. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, prior to entry into the Merger Agreement with Parent, and following a
“market check” in which representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, at the direction of the Anaplan Board, conducted an outreach
initially to prospective strategic acquirers and subsequently to prospective private equity acquirers, none of the contacted acquirers (and no other
potential strategic acquirers) other than Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C, and Private Equity Firm E, submitted an offer to
acquire Anaplan. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan had engaged experienced financial and legal advisors to advise the
Anaplan Board during the process. Based on the results of that process and the advice of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, the Anaplan
Board believed that the price offered by Parent was the highest that was reasonably attainable, particularly in light of the fact that the proposals
received from other private equity bidders involved either an offer price expressed as a discrete number that was below the offer price from Parent
or an offer price expressed as a range where all or a majority of the values in the range were below the offer price from Parent, as well as the belief of
the financial advisors that for the private equity bidders that had submitted bids that included a range of values, they would likely require
significant additional time and diligence work to finalize their views on valuation and as such, there was significant uncertainty as to whether a
more concrete offer at the higher end of their indicated ranges would ultimately be a realistic possibility. The Anaplan Board also believed that the
price offered by Parent was more favorable to the Anaplan stockholders than the potential value that would reasonably be expected to result from
other competing proposals. The Anaplan Board also believed that an acquisition transaction with Parent was most likely to be consummated and
could be consummated more quickly than other competing proposals, in light of the fact that (i) Parent’s proposal offered to fully backstop the
aggregate Merger Consideration with equity funding from the Sponsor and (ii) the proposals received from other private equity bidders indicated
that debt financing would be required and that the bidders desired to partner with other private equity firms in order to fund the remainder of the
aggregate Merger Consideration offered.
Premium to Market Price. The Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent would provide Anaplan’s stockholders with the opportunity to receive a
meaningful premium over the current market price of the shares of Anaplan common stock. The Anaplan Board reviewed the current and historical
market prices with respect to the shares of Anaplan common stock, including the fact that Parent’s offer price of $66.00 per share constituted a
premium of:
•
approximately 30% to $50.59, the closing price of Anaplan common stock on March 18, 2022, the last trading day preceding the day
that the Merger Agreement was executed;
48
Table of Contents
•
approximately 57% to $41.99, the unaffected closing price of Anaplan common stock on February 23, 2022, the last full trading day
prior to the issuance of a press release that Sachem Head had acquired a stake in Anaplan; and
•
approximately 42% to $46.46, the 30-day volume weighted average closing price of the Anaplan common stock, and 43% to $46.02, the
three-month volume weighted average closing price of the Anaplan common stock, in each case, ending as of the close of trading on
March 18, 2022.
Ability to Negotiate Increased Offer Price. The Anaplan Board also considered the fact that Parent increased its offer price from its initial offer of
$63.00 per share to $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock and indicated that its offer price of $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock was
its “best and final” offer. The Anaplan Board believed that the price offered by Parent was the highest price reasonably attainable, in light of
several factors, including without limitation the course of negotiations with Parent, the results of Goldman Sachs’ and Qatalyst Partners’ outreach
to other potential acquirers and the likelihood of other potential acquirers making a higher offer.
Market Volatility and Uncertainty Regarding Similar Strategic Alternatives. The Anaplan Board also considered the volatility in the public
markets and uncertainty of the availability to Anaplan of similar strategic alternatives in the future in light of current marketplace conditions.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan.
The Anaplan Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Anaplan Board by Goldman Sachs at a meeting of the
Anaplan Board on March 20, 2022. At such meeting of the Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by
delivery of its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan Common Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent
and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided
advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any
other matter.
Opinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan
The Anaplan Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Anaplan Board by Qatalyst Partners at a meeting of
the Anaplan Board on March 20, 2022. At such meeting of the Anaplan Board, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Anaplan Board its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications,
limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex C and is incorporated by reference
herein. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Anaplan Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the
holders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other
aspect of the Merger. It does not
49
Table of Contents
constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter
and does not in any manner address the price at which Anaplan common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.
Financial Projections. The Anaplan Board considered the Financial Projections prepared by Anaplan’s senior management team. The Anaplan
Board understood that these Financial Projections were based on assumptions and estimates that are difficult to project and were subject to high
levels of uncertainty and also significant execution risk.
Cash Consideration. The Anaplan Board considered that the form of consideration to be paid to Anaplan stockholders in the Merger was all-cash
and considered the certainty of value compared to other forms of consideration and immediate liquidity associated with such cash consideration,
while eliminating the effect of long-term industry, competitive and execution risk.
Likelihood of Closing. The Anaplan Board concluded that the Merger would likely be consummated in an orderly manner as a result of a number
of factors, including:
•
the meaningful premium over the market price of the shares of Anaplan common stock and certainty of value to Anaplan stockholders
offered by Parent;
•
the business reputation and significant financial resources of Parent and willingness of Parent to consummate the Merger, including
Sponsor’s track record of completing acquisition transactions;
•
the fact that Parent’s proposal offered to fully fund the aggregate Merger Consideration with equity funding from the Sponsor if
necessary;
•
the fact that Parent had obtained a limited guaranty from the Sponsor guaranteeing full payment of the termination fee payable by
Parent to Anaplan in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances;
•
the likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the proposed Merger in light of the scope of the conditions to completion,
including the fact that there were no anticipated significant issues in connection with the HSR Act and other antitrust clearances and
other regulatory approvals;
•
that the Outside Date under the Merger Agreement is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
•
that the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement are reasonable and customary in number and scope and which, in
the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Anaplan’s representations and warranties, are generally subject to a “Material
Adverse Effect” qualification, as described under the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”
beginning on page 91; and
•
Anaplan’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches
of the Merger Agreement, and to enforce specifically the terms of the Merger Agreement, including to cause the Equity Financing
contemplated by Sponsor’s equity commitment letter to be funded, regardless of whether Parent is able to obtain any debt financing
for the transaction as described under the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance” beginning on page 112.
Speed of Closing. The Anaplan Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger and concluded that, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger would allow Anaplan stockholders to receive the
consideration in a relatively short timeframe. The Anaplan Board also determined that such a relatively short timeframe would be expected to
reduce the uncertainty and potential disruption to Anaplan’s business during the pendency of the Merger.
50
Table of Contents
Merger Agreement. The Anaplan Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
•
Ability to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. While Anaplan is prohibited from soliciting any acquisition proposal,
the Merger Agreement does permit the Anaplan Board, subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements (including that the
Anaplan Board determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited
acquisition proposal would reasonably likely lead to a superior proposal), (i) to furnish information with respect to Anaplan to a
person making such unsolicited acquisition proposal and (ii) to participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making
such unsolicited acquisition proposal.
•
Right to Accept Superior Proposals. In the event Anaplan receives a superior proposal, the Anaplan Board may withdraw or change
its recommendation in favor of the Merger if the Anaplan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Anaplan’s stockholders
under applicable law. In order for the Anaplan Board to withdraw or change its recommendation in connection with a superior
proposal, the Anaplan Board must first provide Parent with a right to negotiate with Anaplan to adjust the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement so that such change in recommendation is no longer necessary. If the Anaplan Board terminates the Merger
Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, Anaplan must substantially concurrently pay Parent a termination fee of
$293,122,500 in cash.
•
Change in Recommendation for an Intervening Event. If a specified Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this Proxy
Statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals”) occurs, the Anaplan Board may withdraw or change its
recommendation in favor of the Merger if the Anaplan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Anaplan’s stockholders under applicable law. In
order for the Anaplan Board to withdraw or change its recommendation in connection with such an Intervening Event, the Anaplan
Board must first provide Parent with a right to negotiate with Anaplan to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so
that such change in recommendation is no longer necessary. In the event that the Anaplan Board withdraws or changes its
recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event, Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement, in which case Anaplan must
pay Parent a termination fee of $293,122,500 in cash within three business days after such termination.
•
Termination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under
specified circumstances, including a termination by Anaplan to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to superior
proposal, Anaplan would be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of $293,122,500. The Anaplan Board was of the view that this
termination fee was comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, was reasonable in light of the bidding and
negotiation process that led to the execution of the Merger Agreement, as well as of the terms of the Merger Agreement itself, and
was necessary to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement. The Anaplan Board believed that the termination fee would not
likely deter or preclude another party with interest in Anaplan and financial resources sufficient to consummate an alternative
acquisition transaction with Anaplan, were one to exist, from making a competing proposal for Anaplan and would likely only be
required to be paid in the event that the Anaplan Board entered into a transaction more financially favorable to Anaplan’s
stockholders than the Merger.
•
Conditions to the Completion of the Transactions. The Anaplan Board considered the limited conditions to Parent’s obligations to
consummate the Merger, including the condition that there not have occurred a change or event that would constitute a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in
51
Table of Contents
the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”) that is continuing with
respect to Anaplan. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that specified changes or events would be excluded from the
determination whether Anaplan had experienced a Material Adverse Effect, particularly any change or event resulting from the
announcement, pendency and consummation of the Merger.
•
Regulatory Undertaking by Parent. The Anaplan Board considered that the Merger is subject to a waiting period and appropriate
regulatory clearance, and that Parent is obligated, subject to certain limitations, to use reasonable best efforts to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals.
•
Financing Undertaking by Parent. The Anaplan Board considered that Sponsor provided an equity commitment for the Merger and
the fact that Anaplan is a named third party beneficiary in the equity commitment letter. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that
Parent’s obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon the receipt of third-party debt financing or completion of any debt
financing marketing period.
•
Specific Performance. The Anaplan Board considered Anaplan’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of the
Merger Agreement, including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and to cause the Equity Financing
contemplated by Sponsor’s equity commitment letter to be funded.
•
Reverse Termination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 in cash is payable by
Parent to Anaplan in the event that Parent does not proceed to consummate the Merger in certain circumstances following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and that such payment obligation is supported by a
guaranty provided by Sponsor with respect to Parent’s obligation to pay the reverse termination fee, indemnify and reimburse the
Company for specified costs and expenses incurred in cooperating with any debt financing sought by Parent and pay certain other
amounts under the Merger Agreement (as described in the below section captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger”).
•
Appraisal Rights. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan’s stockholders who do not vote their shares in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law will be entitled to such
appraisal rights with respect to such shares in connection with the Merger, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Anaplan Board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the Merger in making its determination and
reaching its recommendation, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash
transaction means that Anaplan stockholders would no longer be able to participate in any future earnings or growth of Anaplan or benefit from
any appreciation in the value of Anaplan following the consummation of the Merger, which earnings or growth could have resulted, if Anaplan had
remained independent, in future prices for shares of the Anaplan common stock in excess of the Merger Consideration.
Risk of Non-Consummation. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, while Anaplan expects that the Merger will be consummated, there can
be no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied, and that, as a result, the Merger may not be consummated. The Anaplan Board
considered the potential risks associated with a failure of the Merger to be consummated, including (i) the extensive time and effort expended by
Anaplan’s directors, senior management and other employees during the pendency of the proposed Merger, (ii) the significant transaction-related
costs and opportunity costs incurred by Anaplan, (iii) the trading price for shares of Anaplan’s common stock could be negatively
52
Table of Contents
impacted, (iv) Anaplan’s business could be disrupted and negatively impacted, including loss of business partners and employees, and (v) the
market’s perceptions of Anaplan’s prospects could be adversely affected.
Restrictions on Conduct of Business. The Anaplan Board considered the limitations on Anaplan’s pursuit of business opportunities during the
pendency of the Merger due to certain covenants contained in the Merger Agreement requiring Anaplan to operate its business in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and, subject to specified exceptions, to comply with certain other operating restrictions. Such
restrictions could delay or prevent Anaplan from pursuing business opportunities that may arise during the pendency of the proposed Merger
and/or have a significant adverse effect on Anaplan’s ability to respond to changing market and business conditions, in a timely manner, or at all.
Impact of Negotiation and Announcement. The Anaplan Board considered the impact on Anaplan’s business of the negotiation and public
announcement of the proposed Merger, including the potentially negative effects that the negotiation and announcement may have on Anaplan’s
business relationships and its ability to attract and retain key management, technical and other personnel while the Merger is pending.
Inability to Solicit Other Acquisition Proposals. The Anaplan Board considered the covenant in the Merger Agreement prohibiting Anaplan from
soliciting other competing acquisition proposals.
Termination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the possibility that the $293,122,500 termination fee could potentially dissuade a potential
acquirer from proposing an alternative acquisition transaction that could be of greater value to Anaplan stockholders than the Merger.
Antitrust Clearance. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that completion of the Merger is subject to antitrust clearance in the United States.
Possible Loss of Key Management or Other Personnel. The Anaplan Board considered the risk of the possible loss of key management or other
personnel of Anaplan during the pendency of the Merger.
Interests of the Board and Management. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan’s directors and officers may have financial interests
in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of Anaplan’s
other stockholders, and the risk that these interests might influence their decision with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
Tax Treatment. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that the cash consideration to be received by Anaplan stockholders in the Merger would be
taxable to U.S. Holders (as defined under the section captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”).
However, the Anaplan Board noted that the all-cash nature of the consideration payable in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement would provide such Anaplan stockholders with adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.
The foregoing discussion of the reasons for the Anaplan Board’s recommendation that Anaplan stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the
Merger Agreement is not meant to be exhaustive, but addresses the material information and factors considered by the Anaplan Board in consideration
of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Anaplan Board in connection with the evaluation of the Merger and the
complexity of these matters, the Anaplan Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, the Anaplan Board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect
to any of the particular factors considered. Instead, the Anaplan Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above and made its
determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the information reviewed. The judgments of individual members of the Anaplan Board may
have been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by different factors. The Anaplan Board ultimately concluded that, in the aggregate, the potential
benefits of the Merger outweighed the potential risks or negative consequences of the Merger.
53

For the reasons described above, the Anaplan Board unanimously recommends that Anaplan’s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the
Merger Agreement.
Opinions of Anaplan’s Financial Advisors
Opinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan.
At a meeting of the Anaplan Board held on March 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its
written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of
such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services
and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion
is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
•
the Merger Agreement;

business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Anaplan; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Anaplan
common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Anaplan with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without
assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Anaplan Board that the
Financial Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of Anaplan.
Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Anaplan or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
54
Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be
obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed
that the Merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the
effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Anaplan to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Anaplan; nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion, to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)
of shares of Anaplan common stock, of the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders of such shares pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or
the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection
with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Anaplan; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any
of the officers, directors or employees of Anaplan, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $66.00 in cash per
share of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Anaplan common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects
of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Anaplan, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of
Anaplan or Parent or the ability of Anaplan or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily
based on economic, monetary market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion and
Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring
after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in
connection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan
common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman
Sachs.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Financial Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Anaplan to derive a range of illustrative
present values per share of Anaplan common stock. Using the mid-year convention for cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%,
reflecting estimates of Anaplan’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of January 31, 2022 (i) estimates of
unlevered free cash flow for Anaplan, as reflected in the Financial Projections and referred to as “Unlevered Free Cash Flow (Less Stock Based
Compensation and Excluding Cash Tax Savings from NOLs)” in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Certain Financial
Projections,” for the years 2023 through 2032 and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Anaplan, which were calculated by applying an illustrative
range of terminal year multiples ranging from 30.0x to 40.0x, to an estimated terminal year next twelve months, or “NTM,” unlevered free cash flow to be
generated by Anaplan, as provided by management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of Anaplan. Based on the
foregoing, Goldman Sachs also calculated implied terminal value to NTM revenue multiples which ranged from 4.1x to 5.4x. Goldman Sachs derived such
discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or the “CAPM”, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the
company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash
tax rate
56
Table of Contents
and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of terminal year multiples was
estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current enterprise value to unlevered free cash flow
multiples of certain selected scaled software companies, as described below in the section captioned “—Selected Public Company Comparables”.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Anaplan by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Anaplan the net debt of Anaplan as of January 31, 2022 and
added the net present value of cash tax savings from federal net operating losses, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Anaplan. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative
equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Anaplan, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by management of Anaplan, calculated using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of
Anaplan common stock ranging from $52.00 to $80.71.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Anaplan common stock,
which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s
estimated future NTM revenue and assumed one-year forward enterprise value to revenue multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Financial
Projections for each of the fiscal years 2024 through 2026. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for Anaplan as of January 31 for
each of the years 2023 to 2025 by applying enterprise value to NTM revenue multiples of 8.0x to 12.0x to revenue estimates contained in the Financial
Projections for each of the fiscal years 2024 to 2026. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional
judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to NTM revenue multiples for Anaplan and certain selected growth
software companies, as described in the section below captioned “—Selected Public Company Comparables.” Goldman Sachs then subtracted the
amount of Anaplan’s forecasted net debt (defined as gross financial debt less cash) as of January 31, 2023 to 2025, each as provided by the management
of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Anaplan, from the range of implied enterprise values to derive a range of
illustrative equity values for Anaplan as of January 31 of each of the years 2023 to 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of
projected fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as of January 31 of each of the years 2023 to 2025,
respectively, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Anaplan, to derive a range of
implied future equity values per share. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied equity values per share back to January 31, 2022 using an
illustrative discount rate of 11.8% to derive implied present values of future shares prices as of January 31, 2022. The illustrative discount rate of 11.8%
reflected an estimate of Anaplan’s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This
analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Anaplan common stock of $46.14 to $87.94.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the software industry announced
between 2016 and 2021. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the estimated transaction enterprise value, which is (x) the
announced per share consideration paid or payable in the applicable transaction multiplied by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of the target
company plus (y) the net debt of the target company, in each case based on data obtained from public filings. Goldman Sachs then calculated and
compared the estimated transaction enterprise value (x) as a multiple of the target’s estimated NTM revenue from the announcement date of the
transaction (which

we refer to as the “NTM revenue multiple”) and (y) as a growth-adjusted multiple of the target’s estimated NTM revenue from the announcement date of
the transaction (which we refer to as the “growth-adjusted NTM revenue multiple”), in each case based on Institutional Broker’s Estimate System
consensus estimates and Wall Street Research.

While none of the selected transactions or companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Merger or
Anaplan, the companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations, results, market sizes and product profiles that, for
the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of those of Anaplan.
The foregoing analysis indicated an overall median NTM revenue multiple for the selected transactions of 8.2x, a median NTM revenue multiple for
the selected transactions involving a strategic acquirer of 9.1x and a median NTM revenue multiple for the selected transactions involving a financial
acquirer of 7.0x. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative NTM revenue
multiples of 8.0x to 12.0x to the next twelve months revenue of Anaplan reflected in the Financial Projections to derive a range of implied enterprise values
for Anaplan. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the net debt for Anaplan as of January 31, 2022, as provided by
the management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
Anaplan. Goldman Sachs divided the results by the number of fully diluted
58
Table of Contents
outstanding shares of Anaplan common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for
Goldman Sachs’ use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of implied values per share of Anaplan common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, of
$42 to $62.
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 142 all-cash acquisition transactions
announced from 2012 through February 2022, involving a public technology, media or telecommunication company based in the United States as the
target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information,
Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last closing
stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 28% across the period. This analysis also indicated a
25th percentile premium of 18% and 75th percentile premium of 44% across the period. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience,
Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 18% to 44% to the undisturbed closing price per share of Anaplan common stock of
$50.59 as of March 18, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Anaplan common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, of $60 to
$73.

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Anaplan or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Anaplan Board as to the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Anaplan common stock of the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan
common stock to be paid to such

holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses
or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Anaplan, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Anaplan and Parent and was approved by the Anaplan
Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Anaplan during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific merger
consideration to Anaplan or the Anaplan Board or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Anaplan Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Anaplan Board in
making its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as
Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and
employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any
time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other Anaplan, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Corvex and Sachem Head, each of which is a significant
stockholder of Anaplan (the “Significant Stockholders”), and Thoma Bravo, which is an affiliate of a significant equityholder of Parent, and any of their
respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger.
Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Anaplan in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.
During the two year period ended March 10, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by Anaplan or its affiliates
to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation.
Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates and portfolio
companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as
bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering of McAfee Corp. (“McAfee”), a portfolio company of Thoma Bravo, of 23,000,000 shares of its Class
A common stock in October 2020; as financial advisor to Thoma Bravo with respect to its acquisition of RealPage, Inc. in April 2021; as bookrunner with
respect to the initial public offering by Thoma Bravo Advantage, an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, of 100,000,000 units in January 2021; as financial advisor to
McAfee in the sale of certain assets of its enterprise business in March 2021; as financial advisor to Thoma Bravo, with respect to its acquisition of
Proofpoint, Inc. in August 2021; and as financial advisor to McAfee with respect to its sale in March 2022. During the two year period ended March 10,
2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to
Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies of approximately $175 million.
Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Anaplan, Parent, the Significant Stockholders,
Thoma Bravo, and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies for which its Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.
Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-invested with the Significant Stockholders, Thoma Bravo and their respective affiliates from time to time
and may have invested in limited partnership interests of affiliates of the Significant Stockholders or Thoma Bravo from time to time and may do so in the
future.

The Anaplan Board selected Goldman Sachs as one of its financial advisors because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that
has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 24, 2022, Anaplan engaged Goldman Sachs
to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between Anaplan and Goldman Sachs provides for a
transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $56 million, $3 million of which
became payable upon the presentation by Goldman Sachs to the Anaplan Board of the final results of the study Goldman Sachs undertook to determine
whether it was able to render a fairness opinion in connection with the Merger Consideration and the delivery of its opinion, and the remainder of which
is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, Anaplan has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws.
Opinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan
Anaplan retained Qatalyst Partners to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger and to
evaluate whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Anaplan selected
Qatalyst Partners to act as Anaplan’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business
and affairs of Anaplan and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this
Proxy Statement. At the meeting of the Anaplan Board on March 20, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Anaplan Board its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications,
limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board following the meeting of the Anaplan Board.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex C and is incorporated by reference herein.
The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the
review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. The holders of Anaplan common stock should read the opinion carefully in its
entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Anaplan Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger.
It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other
matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Anaplan common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. The summary
of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this Proxy
Statement as Annex C.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and certain publicly available
financial statements and other business and financial information of Anaplan. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the Financial Projections prepared by the
management of Anaplan described in the section below captioned “—Projected Financial Information.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the
past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Anaplan with senior management of Anaplan. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed
the historical market prices and trading activity for Anaplan common stock and compared the financial performance of Anaplan and the prices and trading
activity

Table of Contents
of Anaplan common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information
and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Anaplan. With respect to the
Financial Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of Anaplan, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the
management and board of Anaplan, that the Financial Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of Anaplan of the future financial performance of Anaplan and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners
assumed that the terms of the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed Merger
Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver
or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the Merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on Anaplan or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the
Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Anaplan or its
affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent
verification, upon the assessment of the management of Anaplan as to the existing and future technology and products of Anaplan and the risks
associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by its opinion committee in accordance with its customary
practice.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions
used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not
address the underlying business decision of Anaplan to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic
alternatives that may be available to Anaplan. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock
(other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of Anaplan or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such
consideration.
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated March 20, 2022. The
analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses,
Qatalyst Partners utilized both the Financial Projections, described in the section below captioned “The Merger—Certain Financial Projections”, and
third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of March 18, 2022 (which are referred to as the “street case”). Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial
analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values
for Anaplan common stock as of January 31, 2022 (which is the end of Anaplan’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet
date) by:
•
adding:
(a)
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows (which are referred to as the “UFCF”) of Anaplan,
based on the Financial Projections for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 through fiscal year 2031 (which implied present value
was calculated using a range of discount rates of 11.5% to 15.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for
Anaplan);
(b)
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Anaplan, calculated by multiplying Anaplan’s estimated UFCF of
approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2032, based on the Financial Projections (assuming a long-term cash tax rate of 18.5%, as
provided by Anaplan management), by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months’ estimated UFCF multiples of
17.5x to 30.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment and experience), and discounted to present
value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above;
(c)
the cash and cash equivalents of Anaplan as of January 31, 2022, as reported in the press release reporting its financial results for the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (which was attached to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed March 2, 2022); and
(d)
the implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses for the fiscal years 2032 and beyond,
discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above; and
•
subtracting:
(a)
the value of Anaplan’s finance leases, as of January 31, 2022, as provided by Anaplan management; and
•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock outstanding (calculated utilizing the treasury
stock method, which takes into account outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units, all as provided by
Anaplan management) as of March 18, 2022, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs, terminal value and federal tax
savings due to net operating losses for the fiscal years 2032 and beyond having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to
current stockholders through each respective applicable period (approximately 2.0% to 4.6% annually throughout the projection period) due
to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future
dilution provided by Anaplan management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Anaplan common stock of approximately $40.62 to $78.98 per
share.
Illustrative Selected Companies Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Anaplan with publicly available financial
information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which were
selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business
to Anaplan, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.

Table of Contents
Based upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of March 18, 2022 and using the closing prices as of March 18, 2022 for shares of
the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue
for the calendar year 2022 (which are referred to as the “CY2022E revenue multiples”), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:

Based on an analysis of the CY2022E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst
Partners selected a representative multiple range of 7.0x to 13.0x.
Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to Anaplan’s estimated revenue for calendar year 2022, based on the Financial Projections and based on
the street case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2022 (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), this analysis implied (a) a range of values for Anaplan common stock of approximately $35.40 to $64.00 per share based on the Financial
Projections for calendar year 2022 and (b) a range of values for Anaplan common stock of approximately $34.22 to $61.81 per share based on the street
case for calendar year 2022.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Anaplan. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many
of these matters are beyond the control of Anaplan, such as the impact of competition on Anaplan’s business or the industry in general, industry growth
and the absence of any material adverse change in Anaplan’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general.
Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using selected company data.
Illustrative Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared twenty-three selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies participating in similar
lines of business to Anaplan or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or similar characteristics.
For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of
the target company as a multiple of last-twelve-months’ revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “LTM revenue multiples”) and (b) the
implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months’
revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM revenue multiples”).

Based on the analysis of the LTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a
representative multiple range of 9.0x to 20.0x then applied this range to Anaplan’s last-twelve months’ revenue (calculated as the four quarters ended on
January 31, 2022). Based on the fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2022 (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), this analysis implied a range of values for Anaplan common stock of approximately $34.90 to $75.05 per share.
Based on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a
representative multiple range of 8.0x to 15.0x then applied this range to Anaplan’s estimated next-twelve-months’ revenue (calculated as the four quarters
ending on January 31, 2022) based on the street case. Based on the fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2022
(calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), this analysis implied a range of values for Anaplan common stock of approximately $38.83 to $71.00 per
share.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Anaplan or the Merger. In evaluating the selected
transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Anaplan’s control, such as the impact of competition on Anaplan’s business or the industry
generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Anaplan’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the
financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are
being compared. Individual multiples or
66
Table of Contents
mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected
transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue
reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Anaplan Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a
whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst
Partners’ view of the actual value of Anaplan. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Anaplan. Any
estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger
Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock
(other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which Anaplan
common stock might actually trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Anaplan Board was one of many factors considered by the Anaplan Board in deciding to
approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Anaplan
Board with respect to the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of
shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Anaplan Board would have been willing to agree to
different consideration. The Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Anaplan and
Thoma Bravo and was approved by the Anaplan Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Anaplan during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did
not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Anaplan or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
Merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Anaplan, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates
and Anaplan or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates
may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Anaplan or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners
would expect to receive compensation.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Anaplan with financial advisory services in connection with the Merger for
which it will be paid an amount currently estimated at approximately $56 million, $150,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement
letter and $3 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the
67
Table of Contents
opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation of the Merger. Anaplan has also agreed to reimburse
Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Anaplan has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their
respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’
engagement.",55,76
"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
Anaplan’s senior management does not as a matter of course issue public financial projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the
then current fiscal year or issue public financial projections for extended periods due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, in connection with its strategic review process, including, without limitation, its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby as described in this Proxy Statement, on March 6, 2022 Anaplan’s senior management prepared the Financial Projections set forth
below (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Background of the Merger”), which were provided to each of Goldman
Sachs and Qatalyst Partners in connection with their respective fairness opinions. Anaplan approved the use of the Financial Projections by each of
Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners in performing their respective financial analyses. To give Anaplan stockholders access to certain non-public
information that was available to the Anaplan Board at the time of the evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, Anaplan’s senior
management has included these projections below, subject to the following qualifications and cautionary statements.
Anaplan management prepared the Financial Projections set forth below and delivered to the Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners
based on historical financial statements as well as a series of assumptions and estimates related to future results that it believed to be reasonable at the
time, including assumptions and estimates relating to revenue growth, gross margin percentages, selling, general and administrative expenses, capital
expenditures and related depreciation and amortization, and other relevant factors relating to Anaplan’s long-range operating plan, as well as how certain
of these assumptions and estimates may change over time. The foregoing is a summary of certain key assumptions and estimates and does not purport to
be a comprehensive overview of all assumptions and estimates reflected in the Financial Projections prepared by Anaplan’s senior management.
In addition to the Financial Projections set forth below, Anaplan management also prepared alternative sets of financial projections, one based on a
more optimistic series of assumptions and estimates related to future results and another based on a more conservative series of assumptions and
estimates related to future results. While Anaplan management reviewed such alternative sets of projections with the Anaplan Board in order to assist
the Anaplan Board in assessing a range of possible outcomes should Anaplan remain an independent company, the Anaplan Board and management
ultimately concluded that of the three sets of financial projections, the Financial Projections set forth below were based on the most reasonable series of
assumptions and estimates related to future results and were the most reliable representation of future operating results, subject to the qualifications
described herein. The Anaplan Board then directed Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to use such Financial Projections set forth below in connection
with preparing their respective fairness opinions. Neither Goldman Sachs nor Qatalyst Partners used or relied upon the alternative sets of projections in
connection with preparing their respective fairness opinions.
The Financial Projections set forth below, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous assumptions and
estimates that are inherently uncertain. Because the Financial Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty
with each successive year. In addition, the Financial Projections would be affected by Anaplan’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets
over the applicable periods. The assumptions upon which the Financial Projections were based necessarily involve subjective judgments with respect to,
among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict
68Table of Contents
accurately and many of which are beyond Anaplan’s control. The Financial Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. As such, there can be no assurance that the Financial Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher
or lower than those forecasted. The inclusion of the Financial Projections in this Proxy Statement should not be regarded as an indication that Anaplan,
the Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners, any of their respective affiliates, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now
considers, such projections to be a reliable prediction of future results or any actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as
such. The inclusion of the Financial Projections herein should not be deemed an admission or representation by Anaplan that they are viewed by
Anaplan as material information of Anaplan. No representation is made by Anaplan or any other person to any Anaplan stockholder regarding the
Financial Projections or the ultimate performance of Anaplan compared to such information.
The Financial Projections did not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other effects of such matters. The Financial Projections were prepared solely for internal use and were
not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. No independent registered public accounting firm, has examined, compiled, nor performed any procedures with respect to the Financial
Projections.
The Financial Projections are not being included in this document to influence the decision of Anaplan stockholders whether to vote in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement, but rather because such Financial Projections, or portions of such Financial Projections, were provided to the
Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners. The information from the Financial Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with
the historical financial statements and other information regarding Anaplan contained in Anaplan’s public filings with the SEC.
All financial projections are forward-looking statements. These and other forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in Anaplan’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to
discussion entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 22.
As indicated above, Anaplan’s future financial results may materially differ from those expressed in the Financial Projections due to factors that are
beyond management’s ability to control or predict. Anaplan cannot assure that any of the Financial Projections will be realized or that its future financial
results will not materially vary from the Financial Projections. The Financial Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring
after the date they were prepared and have not been updated since their respective dates of preparation. They should not be utilized as public guidance
and will not be provided in the ordinary course of Anaplan’s business in the future.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Financial Projections, Anaplan stockholders are cautioned not to place
undue, if any, reliance on the Financial Projections included in this Proxy Statement, including in making a decision as to whether to vote in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement.

“Non-GAAP Operating Income” is defined as total revenue less cost of goods sold and operating expenses, excluding the impact of stock-based
compensation, employer payroll tax expense related to employee stock plans, business combination and other related costs, and amortization of
acquired intangibles.
(2)
Unlevered free cash flow is calculated as non-GAAP operating income (loss), subtracting the impact of cash taxes, and adding or subtracting (as
applicable) the net impact of depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred commissions, changes in net working capital,
capitalization of research and development costs, and capital expenditures. Through FY 31E, unlevered free cash flow reflecting cash tax savings
from federal net operating losses was used by Qatalyst Partners in performing its financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described
in more detail in the section above captioned “Opinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan.”
(3)
Unlevered free cash flow (less stock-based compensation and excluding cash tax savings from NOLs) is calculated as non-GAAP operating

adding or subtracting (as applicable) the net impact of depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred commissions, capitalization of
deferred commissions, changes in net working capital, change in deferred revenue, capitalization of research and development costs, and capital
expenditures. Unlevered free cash flow less stock-based compensation and excluding cash tax savings from federal net operating losses was used
by Goldman Sachs in performing its financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described in more detail in the section above captioned

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed
at the time, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by
stockholders.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the table in the section below captioned “—Golden Parachute Compensation” were used:
•
the effective time is April 1, 2022, which is the assumed date of the effective time of the merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this
section (which we refer to as the “assumed effective time”);
•
the relevant price per share of Anaplan’s common stock is $65.21 per share, which is the closing price of Anaplan common stock as of the
assumed effective time; and
•
the employment of each executive officer of Anaplan is terminated in an “involuntary termination without cause” or due to the executive
officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as each such term is defined in the applicable plan), in each case, immediately following the
assumed effective time.
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
Treatment of Stock Options in the Merger
As of the Record Date, there were 4,425,144 outstanding options to acquire Anaplan common stock of which all options were “in-the-money” (that
is, with an exercise price less than the Merger Consideration) and 0 options were “out-of-the-money” (that is, with an exercise price equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration). As of the Record Date, Anaplan’s directors and executive officers held 3,047,727 “in-the-money” options. The Merger
Agreement provides that Anaplan’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment
at the Effective Time:
Each Vested Company Stock Option outstanding to purchase shares of common stock and each Additional Vesting Company Stock Option will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to withholding for all required taxes) equal to the
product of (1) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such Vested
Company Stock Option or Additional Vesting Company Stock Option and (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such Vested
Company Stock Option or Additional Vesting Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Unvested Company Stock Option
outstanding to purchase shares of common stock, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to withholding for all required taxes) equal to the product of (1) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price
per share of common stock underlying such stock option; and (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the optionholder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries until the applicable vesting date(s), vest
and be payable at the same time as such Unvested Company Stock Options would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting). Each option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be cancelled without consideration.
71Table of Contents
For any Company Performance Option, (A) the performance metrics of such Company Performance Option will be deemed achieved as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of the target levels of performance and (B) shall be treated like other Company
Stock Options pursuant to the preceding paragraph, it being understood that (x) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed a Vested Company
Stock Option with respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed an Unvested
Company Stock Option with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company Stock Option
to vest subject to the optionholder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).
Treatment of Restricted Stock Units in the Merger
As of the Record Date, there were 8,947,507 outstanding restricted stock units (rights to receive Anaplan shares), 1,323,756 of which were held by
our directors and executive officers. As of the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU and each Additional Vesting Company RSU will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to withholdings for all required taxes) equal to the product of (1)
the Merger Consideration and (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such Vested Company RSU or Additional Vesting Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Unvested Company RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to withholdings for all required taxes) equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the total number of shares of
common stock subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the RSU holder’s continued service with
Parent or its subsidiaries through the applicable vesting date(s), vest and be payable at the same time as such Unvested Company RSUs would have
vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting) and under the same
conditions as such Unvested Company RSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of
Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the cash amounts.
For any Company Performance RSU, (A) the performance metrics of such Company Performance RSU will be deemed achieved as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time at 100% of the target levels of performance and (B) shall be treated like other Company RSUs pursuant to the preceding
paragraph, it being understood that (x) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed a Vested Company RSU with respect to one-third (1/3) of the
shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed an Unvested Company RSU with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the
shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company RSU to vest subject to the RSU holder’s continued service with Parent or its
subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).
Director Equity Awards
Non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive equity awards in consideration of their service on the Board of Directors. All such awards
will vest in full upon the Effective Time and will be cancelled and paid out as described above.
Equity Interests of Anaplan’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors
The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock underlying equity awards that are
in-the-money (at the Merger Consideration, in the case of Company Stock Options) and are currently held by each of Anaplan’s executive officers and
non-employee directors, in each case that either are currently vested or that will or may vest in connection with the Merger, assuming that the Effective
Time occurs on April 1, 2022. A portion of the unvested shares underlying Company Stock Options held by our officers and directors are early exercisable
and therefore subject to certain rights of repurchase by

The directors and executive officers hold options to purchase an aggregate of 3,047,727 shares of common stock as set forth in this column. All such options are “in-
the-money” and are either vested or will accelerate upon a change in control, assuming each of the executive officers will be subject to an “involuntary termination
without cause” or will resign for “good reason” (any such termination or resignation, a “qualifying termination”), in each case, immediately following the assumed
effective time of the change in control. The directors and executive officers hold no outstanding options to purchase Anaplan common stock that are “out-of-the-
money.”

Potential Severance Payments and Benefits
Severance and Change in Control Agreements
Anaplan has entered into severance and change in control agreements (the “Post-Employment Compensation Agreements”) with certain of its
executive officers, which provide for specified payments and benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment, including a
qualifying termination of employment in connection with a change in control. Except as noted hereafter or in the section of this Proxy Statement
captioned “Treatment of Equity-Based Awards”, no payments, benefits or acceleration of vesting of payments or benefits will be triggered solely upon
the occurrence of a change in control, unless an acquirer does not assume or substitute a comparable award for an outstanding equity award or a named
executive officer is subject to a qualifying termination during the change in control period beginning three (3) months before and up to twelve (12)
months after a qualified change in control, or 18 months in case of our CEO (the “CiC Period”) (a so-called “double-trigger” arrangement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any performance-based equity held by a named executive officer will be treated as provided below. Generally, in the case
of the acceleration of vesting of outstanding equity awards, we use this “double-trigger” arrangement to protect against the loss of retention value
following a change in control and to avoid windfalls, both of which could occur if vesting of either equity or cash-based awards accelerated automatically
as a result of the transaction. In the event such executive officers is subject to a qualifying termination during a CiC Period, each such executive would be
73
Table of Contents
entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to 12 months of such executive’s base salary, target bonus, and COBRA payments, as well as 100%
acceleration of any unvested equity held at the time of termination, with any performance goals deemed achieved at the greater of 100% of target or actual
performance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and other than with respect to any outstanding performance-based equity, under the terms of his Post-Employment
Compensation Agreement with us, if Mr. Calderoni remains employed through the occurrence of a change in control, then 50% of his then-unvested
shares subject to his outstanding equity awards will immediately vest, and in the case of Company Stock Options become immediately exercisable, and if
he remains in continuous service with us through the one-year anniversary of a change in control, then 100% of his then-unvested shares subject to
such outstanding equity awards will immediately vest, and in the case of Company Stock Options become immediately exercisable. In addition, if Mr.
Calderoni is terminated during the CiC Period, he would be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to 18 months of such executive’s base salary,
target bonus, and COBRA payments, as well as 100% acceleration of any unvested equity held at the time of termination, with any performance goals
deemed achieved at the greater of 100% of target or actual performance.
With respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Schuh in December 2020, the applicable award agreement provides that
if Mr. Schuh is subject to a qualifying termination during the CIC Period, the award will vest in full, and the performance condition will be deemed
achieved at the greater of actual performance or target achievement.
With respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to each of Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh in February 2021, the applicable award
agreements provide that if Mrs. Pinczuk or Mr. Schuh remains in continuous service through a change of control, a pro rata portion of their awards will
vest immediately prior to the change in control, with the performance condition deemed achieved based on actual performance and the extent to which
they have satisfied the service condition through such date, and an additional portion of the awards will vest on January 31, 2024, based on actual
performance through the change in control, subject to Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh remaining in continuous service through such vesting date. In
addition, if such executive officer were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC Period, the vesting described above for each of their
performance-based awards would occur upon such termination, with the performance condition deemed achieved based on the greater of actual
performance or target achievement.
With respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to each of Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh in September 2021, and the
performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Mehta in July 2021, the applicable award agreements provide that if such executive remains in
continuous service through a change of control, a portion of their awards will vest on each of the remaining quarterly installment dates, with the
performance condition deemed achieved based on actual performance through the change in control, subject to such executive officer remaining in
continuous service through each such vesting date. In addition, if such executive officer were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC
Period, the vesting described above for each of their performance-based awards would occur upon such termination, with the performance condition
deemed achieved based on the greater of actual performance or target achievement. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Mrs. Pinczuk’s, Mr. Schuh’s,
and Mr. Mehta’s performance-based equity awards, if they become eligible for more favorable vesting acceleration provisions pursuant to any other
written agreement with the Company, including a severance and change in control agreement, the more favorable terms in such other agreement shall
apply instead of the acceleration terms in the aforementioned performance-based equity agreements.
With respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Calderoni in February 2021, the applicable award agreement provides
that if Mr. Calderoni remains in continuous service through a change in control transaction, then 50% of his award, to the extent the performance
condition was satisfied, will vest immediately prior to the change in control, and the remaining 50% of the award, to the extent the performance condition
was satisfied, will vest if Mr. Calderoni remains in continuous service through the first anniversary of the closing of the change in control, with the
performance condition deemed achieved based on actual
74
Table of Contents
performance through the change in control. In addition, if Mr. Calderoni were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC Period, the vesting
described above would occur upon such termination.
In addition, for the aforementioned executives, to the extent either the terms provided under the Merger Agreement or the terms of his or her
performance-based award agreement or other written agreement with the Company provides for more favorable treatment with respect to the achievement
of a performance or vesting condition or the timing of payments in connection with or following a change in control, such more favorable terms shall
apply.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section
for further information regarding this compensation. The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable
assuming, solely for purposes of this table, that the Merger was consummated on April 1, 2022, and that the employment of each of the named executive
officers was immediately terminated either by Anaplan without cause or as a result of the officer’s resignation with good reason. Anaplan’s executive
officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger. Some of the
amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In addition to the assumptions regarding the
consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the
footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may
differ from the amounts set forth below.
The amounts set forth below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers using the assumptions described
above under the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Anaplan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Certain Assumptions.” These
estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this Proxy Statement. All dollar
amounts set forth below have been rounded. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available, and as a result the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects.

For Mr. Calderoni, this amount represents a single lump-sum payment equal to 18 months of his base salary and 150% achievement of his 2021
target bonus, payable by the Company. For Mr. Mehta, Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh, this amount represents a single lump-sum payment equal to 12
months of their base salary and 100% achievement of their target bonus for 2021, payable by the Company. Neither Mr. Morton nor Ms. Lee would
be entitled to receive any severance benefits as the result of a termination of employment in connection with the Merger due to their earlier
terminations of employment with Anaplan.

For all named executive officers other than Mr. Morton and Ms. Lee, this amount includes the full acceleration and cancellation of all unvested
equity, including Company Stock Options and Company RSUs

Mr. Morton and Ms. Lee ceased providing services to Anaplan in July 2021 and October 2021, respectively. As such, they are not eligible for any
additional compensation in connection with the Merger; accordingly, there are no amounts to report for them due to their earlier terminations of
employment with Anaplan.
Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Anaplan
pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses or similar agreement by Anaplan or any of its subsidiaries in favor of any
Indemnified Person (as defined below) (the “Indemnification Agreements”) (and all other indemnification agreements of Anaplan that are on terms
substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Anaplan (or comparable organizational documents of its subsidiaries) in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement; provided, that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law.
Prior to the Effective Time, Anaplan shall, and for six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide officers’ and directors’ liability, fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time covering each person who is or was prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of Anaplan or its subsidiaries and each
person who is now or was prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of Anaplan or its subsidiaries who served as a fiduciary under or with respect
to any employee benefit plan of Anaplan or its subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Person”) covered as of the date of the Merger Agreement by
Anaplan’s D&O Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA; provided, that, the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to pay annual premiums in the aggregate in excess of 400% of the amount per annum Anaplan paid in its last full fiscal year (provided, that if
the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most
advantageous policies available for an annual premium equal to such amount). In furtherance of and subject to the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time,
Anaplan shall purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect to
coverage and premium amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and
upon the purchase of such insurance Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations shall be deemed satisfied for so long as such insurance is in
full force and effect and covers the matters that would otherwise be covered pursuant to the foregoing; Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
cancel any D&O Insurance (Including any “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy) during its term.
The rights of each Indemnified Person set forth above shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to which each Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom the foregoing provisions apply without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that
may be incurred by an Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided pursuant to the foregoing provisions.

If (1) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (x) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (y) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person or (2) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth above.
Executive Officers Following the Merger
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any new agreement or arrangement with Anaplan, Thoma
Bravo or any of their affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or
more of its affiliates, and under the Merger Agreement, any such agreement would require the approval of the Company. The Merger is not conditioned
upon any Anaplan executive officer agreeing to remain with the Surviving Corporation.
Financing of the Merger",79,85
"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $10.7 billion, which
will be funded via equity and debt financing described below; provided that if any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable, such unavailability
will not affect Sponsor’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter described below. This amount includes funds needed to pay (1) the Merger
Consideration payable for all shares of Anaplan common stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (2) any other
amounts required to be paid at the closing in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including
any and all payments with respect to Company Stock Options or Company RSUs payable under the Merger Agreement at closing), and (3) all associated
fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Equity
Financing, in each case, to the extent required to be paid on the closing date. Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Anaplan in the Merger
Agreement that, when taken together with Anaplan’s cash on hand, the aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing are sufficient to pay the fees and
expenses required to be paid at the closing of the Merger by them under the Merger Agreement.
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained a commitment from Sponsor to provide equity pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter. In
connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to Anaplan a copy of the Equity Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding
anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Parent has separately obtained debt financing commitments and does not presently anticipate that the entire $10,500,000,000 equity commitment
under the Equity Commitment Letter will be funded in equity in connection with the closing.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, Sponsor has committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent at the closing of the Merger
certain equity financing for the purpose of funding the Merger Consideration payable for all shares of Anaplan common stock in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any other amounts required to be paid at the closing in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any and all payments with respect to Company Stock Options or Company RSUs payable
under the Merger Agreement at closing) and,
77Table of Contents
together with the Company’s cash on hand as of the closing date, all associated fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including that certain equity financing, in each case, to the extent required to be paid on the closing
date (collectively, the “Required Amount”). The obligations of Thoma Bravo to provide the equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letter are
subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the satisfaction or written waiver by the parties to the Merger Agreement, as
applicable, of each of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement set forth in
Section 7.1 and 7.2 of the Merger Agreement (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions prior to or substantially concurrent with the closing), and (ii) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. We refer to the equity financing described in the preceding sentence as the “Equity Financing.”
The obligation of Thoma Bravo to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the
consummation of the closing of the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration and the payment or provision for the other Required Amount in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, (ii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iii) three (3) months
following the Outside Date, unless prior to the end of such period the Company shall have, pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, commenced a
court proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub seeking specific performance to cause the Merger to be consummated, in which case the Equity
Commitment Letter and such funding obligation shall remain in full force and effect until such funding obligation is fully performed according to a final
and non-appealable order of a chosen court or there is a final and non-appealable order of a chosen court to the effect that no such funding is required.
Anaplan is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the
commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter by Thoma Bravo to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, subject to (i)
the limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Limited Guaranty,"Limited Guaranty
Pursuant to the Guaranty, Sponsor has agreed to guarantee the due, punctual and complete payment and performance of: (1) the aggregate amount
of the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.”) solely if and
when any of the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (2) any enforcement expenses due by Parent pursuant to legal
proceedings as a result of certain defaults under the Merger Agreement; (3) the reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to the indemnification
obligations to Anaplan and its representatives in connection with debt financing; and (4) any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses resulting from
Parent or Merger Sub’s willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations. We refer to the obligations set forth in the
preceding sentence as the “Guaranteed Obligations.” The obligations of Thoma Bravo under the Guaranty are subject to an aggregate cap equal to

Appraisal Rights",87,87
"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Anaplan’s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 will be entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the
full text of Section 262, which is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor
does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Anaplan
common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Anaplan
common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Anaplan common stock through
a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of Anaplan common stock who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, who
continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time, and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be
entitled to the appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value of their shares of Anaplan common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value of
the shares from the effective date of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter
only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
79Table of Contents
Under Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty
(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a
copy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement constitutes Anaplan’s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Anaplan common
stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly
comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who
loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Anaplan common stock, Anaplan believes that if a stockholder is
considering exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Anaplan common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must NOT vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but
does not otherwise contain voting instructions will be, unless revoked, voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder
who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or
not vote its shares;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Anaplan a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at
the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Anaplan common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time. A stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time; and
•
the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file
any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of Anaplan
stockholders to take all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock within the time
prescribed in Section 262.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Anaplan common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Anaplan, before the vote on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written
demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not submit a blank proxy or vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of Anaplan common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the
written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not
contain voting instructions will be, unless revoked, voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and
who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, or
abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights may instead not vote its
shares. However, neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger

Table of Contents
Agreement. A proxy or vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute such a written demand. A stockholder’s failure to
make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of Anaplan stockholders
will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Anaplan common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably
inform Anaplan of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the
Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on
behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand
must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a
demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO
EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKERS, BANKS AND NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE
SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A
BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to Anaplan, Inc., 50 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco,
California 94105, Attention: Corporate Secretary, and must be delivered before the vote on the Merger Agreement is taken at the Special Meeting and
should be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Anaplan common stock.
Any holder of Anaplan common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the
Merger Agreement by delivering to Anaplan a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving
Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Anaplan common
stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become
effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of Anaplan common
stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition
in the Delaware
81
Table of Contents
Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair
value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file
a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
shares of Anaplan common stock. Accordingly, any holders of Anaplan common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section
262. The failure of a holder of Anaplan common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s
previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of Anaplan common stock who has complied with the requirements for
exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of shares not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Anaplan has received demands for
appraisal and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within
ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s
own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for
appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Anaplan common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal thereunder. The
Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. In addition, because shares of Anaplan common stock are listed on a
national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of Anaplan common stock,
(2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL (which deal with short-form mergers).
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Anaplan common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the fair value of the
shares of Anaplan common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest,
if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all
relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
82
Table of Contents
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme
Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,
in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise
and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,”
but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an
opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Anaplan believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no
representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither
Anaplan nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder of Anaplan exercising appraisal rights, and each of
Anaplan and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the fair value of a share of Anaplan
common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the
appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Anaplan common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses, his or her appraisal
rights, or successfully withdraws such demand for appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Anaplan common stock will be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration applicable to the shares, less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail
to perfect, or lose, his or her appraisal rights, or effectively withdraw a demand for appraisal, if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Anaplan common stock for any
purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of
Anaplan common stock, if any, payable to stockholders of Anaplan of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, if no
petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then
the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the
83
Table of Contents
appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder of Anaplan without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder of Anaplan wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those
rights.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-
U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this Proxy
Statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate or gift taxation) or the
alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax that may be relevant or applicable to a particular holder in connection with the
Merger. For purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may
require.
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their
particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations;
S-corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion
rules; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders holding their shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
•
holders who hold their shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
holders who hold their shares as “qualified small business stock” pursuant to Section 1202 of the Code;
•
holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction;
•
holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Merger;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident
outside the United States;
84Table of Contents
•
holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to their shares as a result of such income being
recognized on an applicable financial statement; or
•
holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors
regarding the consequences of the Merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described below. No
assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this discussion, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the
event of litigation.
HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL
OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or any other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or (2) that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the Merger and otherwise will be a short-term capital gain or loss.
A reduced tax rate on capital gain currently applies to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). There are limitations
on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder
must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.
A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding in connection with the Merger. Certain U.S. Holders (including, with
respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally are not subject to backup withholding. In order to avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder
that does not otherwise establish an exemption should furnish a correct taxpayer identification number, certify that it is not subject to backup withholding
on a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 and otherwise comply with backup withholding rules.
85
Table of Contents
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as “controlled foreign corporations”
or “passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other
tax consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.
In general, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to the Non-U.S. Holder’s permanent establishment or a fixed base in the United States);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three (183) days or more in the taxable
year in which the gain is realized, and certain other specified conditions are met; or
•
Anaplan is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code
(“USRPHC”) and certain other requirements are met. Although we can make no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and
have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding the Merger.
Payments made to Non-U.S. Holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Non-U.S. Holders generally
can avoid backup withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the applicable and properly completed and executed IRS
Form W-8 certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit
against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX LAWS OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
THE FOREGOING SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE TAX ADVICE. ALL HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO
THE APPLICATION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX RULES, OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAXING
JURISDICTION.

"Anaplan, Inc._20220502_DEFM14A_20059827_4454121.Pdf",Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
Anaplan and Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all
regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include (i)
the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; and (ii) any other required approvals under any foreign or other
antitrust law (although the parties do not currently believe any such other required approvals exist).
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Anaplan and Parent file a notification and report
form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of the
waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a thirty (30)-day period) or the early termination of that
waiting period. Anaplan and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on April 1, 2022, the 30-day waiting
period with respect to which is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, May 2, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the
DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of
the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
Other Regulatory Approvals
Although the parties believe that approval under the HSR Act is the only regulatory approval required in connection with the Merger, one or more
governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents.
Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could
significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of
the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the
approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances
and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all, or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

On April 27, 2022, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Preliminary Proxy Statement filed on April 21, 2022, relating to the Merger, omitted material
information that rendered it incomplete and misleading. The
87Table of Contents
lawsuit, filed as an individual action by a purported stockholder of Anaplan, is captioned Ryan O’Dell v. Anaplan, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-03427 (S.D.N.Y.). As
a result of the alleged omissions, the lawsuit seeks to hold Anaplan and its directors liable for violating Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, and additionally seeks to hold Anaplan’s directors liable as control persons pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The
lawsuit seeks, among other relief, an order enjoining consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger in the event it is consummated, and damages.
Anaplan has not yet responded to the complaints filed in the lawsuit. While Anaplan believes that the lawsuit is meritless, there can be no assurance that
it will ultimately prevail in the lawsuit. Additionally, similar lawsuits may be filed before the Special Meeting.

The Merger Agreement provides that Anaplan’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment at the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and the holder of such
equity award or as contemplated by the Disclosure Schedule:
•
Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested
or exercisable, including any Company Stock Options that become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company Stock
Option that would have vested according to its terms on the date of the Merger agreement, on or prior to January 31, 2023, will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to withholding for all required taxes) equal to the
product of (1) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such
Company Stock Option; and (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The cash right with respect to each Unvested Company Stock Option will be subject to the same continuous service-
based vesting requirement that otherwise applied to the Unvested Company Stock Option. Each Company Stock Option with an exercise
price per share equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled without consideration.

•
Performance Options. For any Company Performance Options that are outstanding as of the Effective Time, (A) the performance metrics of
such Company Performance Option will be deemed achieved as of immediately prior to the Effective Time at one hundred percent (100%) of
the target levels of performance and (B) shall be treated like other Company Stock Options pursuant to the preceding paragraph, it being
understood that (x) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed a Vested Company Stock Option with respect to one-third (1/3) of
the shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance Option shall be deemed an Unvested Company Stock Option with respect to
two-thirds (2/3) of the shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company Stock Option to vest subject to the
optionholder’s continued service with Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).
•
Restricted Stock Units. Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested, including any Company
RSUs that become vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company RSU that would have vested according to their terms
as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, on or prior to January 31, 2023, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to withholdings for all required taxes) equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and
(2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. The cash right with
respect to each Unvested Company RSU will be subject to the same continuous service-based vesting requirement that otherwise applied
to the Unvested Company RSU, and will be payable at the same time as such Unvested Company RSUs would have vested pursuant to its
terms.

understood that (x) such Company Performance RSUs shall be deemed a Vested Company RSU with respect to one-third (1/3) of the shares
subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed an Unvested Company RSU with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the
shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company RSU to vest subject to the RSU holder’s continued service with
Parent or its subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).
•
ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, Anaplan shall take all actions necessary such that the current offering period in progress as of the date of
the Merger Agreement shall be the final offering period under the Company 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”). If
such offering period has not ended prior to the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective Time, Anaplan (x) shall take all actions necessary
to determine a date no later than the Effective Time to be the last day of such offering period and (y) shall make other pro rata adjustments
necessary to reflect the shortened and final offering period but otherwise treating the shortened and final offering period as a fully effective
and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP. In addition, effective as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
Anaplan shall have taken all actions necessary such that (x) no new participant shall be permitted to join the current offering period in
progress under the Company ESPP and (y) no participant in the Company ESPP with respect to the current offering period shall be permitted
to increase his or her elections with respect to the current offering period (including making any non-payroll contributions). Unless it has
earlier terminated, Anaplan shall take all actions necessary so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to
purchase Anaplan common stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms
of the Company ESPP.

On the closing date, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration to stockholders (but not including any merger consideration in respect of any dissenting shares).
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of Anaplan common stock as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration a letter of transmittal together with instructions.
Upon receipt of (i) in the case of shares of Anaplan common stock represented by a stock certificate, a surrendered certificate or certificates in respect of
such shares together with the signed letter of transmittal or (ii) in the case of shares of Anaplan common stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the paying agent, and in each case, together with such other documents as may be reasonably required by the paying agent, the
holder of such shares will be entitled to receive in exchange the Merger Consideration without interest. The amount of any Merger Consideration paid to
the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains undistributed to holders of Anaplan common stock six (6) months after the Effective Time,
such cash (including any interest received) will be delivered to Parent or one of its affiliates upon demand, and any holder of Anaplan common stock who
has not complied with the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration, without any interest.
If any stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such stock certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed (and if required by Parent, the posting of the person of a bond, in a reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the stock certificate), the paying agent will, in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed
stock certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

From and after the date of the Merger Agreement and until earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its
terms (the “No-Shop Period”), Anaplan has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries (and instruct and cause its and their respective officers and
directors not to and instruct their respective Representatives not to), directly or indirectly, among other things:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or the making thereof to Anaplan or its stockholders;
•
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-public information to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives) with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; or

•
take any action to render any provision of any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination” or other
similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
Anaplan’s organizational documents, in each case inapplicable to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) or
any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, Anaplan shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver
that may have been granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions).
Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the time that adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Anaplan common stock entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders’ meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the “Requisite Company
Vote”) is obtained, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of the foregoing restrictions, Anaplan may provide
information to, and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with, a person regarding an Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Superior Proposal (as defined
below) or would reasonably likely lead to a Superior Proposal and not to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, that all such information has previously been made available to Parent or is made available to Parent prior to or promptly following the time
it is provided to such person. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, Anaplan may, solely
to the extent the Anaplan Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, not enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which Anaplan or any of its
subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other party to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal that will constitute, or would
reasonably likely lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result from a material breach by Anaplan of the previous restrictions.
For purposes of this Proxy Statement and the Merger Agreement:
•
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means customary confidentiality agreement between Anaplan and any person making an
Acquisition Proposal, the terms of which are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Anaplan than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to restrict the submission to Anaplan of
Acquisition Proposals and such confidentiality agreement shall permit Anaplan to comply with its obligations under the Merger
Agreement);
•
“Acquisition Agreement” means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Anaplan’s stockholders and notwithstanding the restrictions described above in the section
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals,” the Board of Directors is permitted under certain circumstances and subject to Anaplan’s
compliance with certain obligations (as summarized below), to (i) make a Change in Recommendation, and (ii) terminate the Merger Agreement and enter
into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior Proposal.
The Board of Directors is permitted to (i) make a Change in Recommendation in the case of a Superior Proposal, or (ii) terminate the Merger
Agreement to simultaneously enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior Proposal provided that such Superior Proposal did not
result from a material breach of the No-Shop Period restrictions, and if, in each case, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (1) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law and (2) it has complied with the procedure and its obligations as summarized in the following paragraph.
The Board of Directors may not make a Change in Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in the case of a Superior Proposal unless (i)
Anaplan shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of its intention to take such action (a “Notice of
Designated Superior Proposal”), and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or termination of the Merger Agreement, Anaplan shall, and
shall cause its representatives to, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer
necessary and such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal (and in the event of any material change to any of the terms (including
any change to the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) of such Superior Proposal Anaplan shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in this clause and a renewed negotiation period under this clause shall commence (except that the five (5)
business day period shall instead be equal to two (2) business days; provided that if such additional notice is delivered during the initial five (5) business
day negotiation period, the initial negotiation period shall not be reduced by such notice)) and (ii) following such notice period (including any
subsequent notice period), the Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor and financial
advisors and taking into account Parent’s proposed adjustments (if any) to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, that the failure to effect a
Change in Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that, that
Anaplan shall not be entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement, and any purported termination shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
substantially concurrently with such termination Anaplan pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds a termination fee of $293,122,500.
The Board of Directors is permitted to make a Change in Recommendation in the event of an Intervening Event if the Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) (1) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (2) it has complied with the procedure and its obligations as summarized in the following paragraph.

The Board of Directors may not make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event unless (i) Anaplan shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of its intention to take such action, and prior to effecting such Change in
Recommendation, Anaplan shall, and shall cause its representatives to, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Change in
Recommendation is no longer necessary (and in the event of any material change to the circumstances related to the Intervening Event, Anaplan shall, in
each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in this clause and a renewed negotiation period under this clause shall
commence (except that the five (5) business day period shall instead be equal to two (2) business days; provided that if such additional notice is
delivered during the initial five (5) business day negotiation period, the initial negotiation period shall not be reduced by such notice)) and (ii) following
such notice period (including any subsequent notice period), the Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal advisor and taking into account Parent’s proposed adjustments (if any) to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, that the
failure to effect a Change in Recommendation due to an Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
provided, that the Board of Directors shall not be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by the provisions set forth above regarding a Superior Proposal).
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the Merger Agreement does not prohibit Anaplan or the Board of Directors from (i) making any
disclosure to Anaplan’s stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to
make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (ii) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or under
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the stockholders);
provided, that (A) this exception shall not be deemed to affect whether any such disclosure, other than a “stop, look and listen” communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, would otherwise be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation and (B) any such disclosure
pursuant to subsection (i) above shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Anaplan or the Board of Directors described above under the
sections captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change
in Recommendation”. For purposes of clarity and avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes Anaplan’s receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, that the Board of Directors is considering the Acquisition Proposal and that states that no position has been taken by the Board of
Directors as to the advisability or desirability of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto will not be
deemed a Change in Recommendation.
Stockholders Meeting
Anaplan agreed to take all action necessary to convene a stockholders meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of mailing
of the Proxy Statement (the “Stockholders Meeting”) (provided that, subject to the sentence that follows, the Stockholders Meeting shall not be held
later than forty-five (45) days following confirmation from the SEC that it will not review or that it has completed its review of the Proxy Statement (which
confirmation will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified Anaplan prior to the tenth calendar day after filing the Proxy Statement that
the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement)), for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote. Anaplan may postpone or adjourn
such meeting (A) to the extent required by applicable law (including to permit the filing and dissemination of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required under applicable law), (B)

received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) days in connection

Anaplan delivers (or has delivered) a notice of an intent to make a Change in Recommendation, as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business days, or (D) with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Once Anaplan has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, Anaplan will not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or
otherwise required by applicable law. Anaplan has agreed that, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and Anaplan has
paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee (as defined below) in accordance with terms of the Merger Agreement, its obligations to hold the
Stockholders Meeting and submit the Merger Agreement to Anaplan’s stockholders to obtain the Requisite Company Vote will not be affected in any
manner, including in connection with (i) the making of a Change in Recommendation by the Anaplan Board (ii) the commencement of or announcement or
disclosure of or communication to Anaplan of any Acquisition Proposal.
Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of the Merger Agreement will
be the only matter (other than related procedural matters) that Anaplan will propose to be acted on by its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

wages, target short-term cash bonus opportunities and commission formulas but to exclude long-term cash compensation, any equity or equity-based
compensation and severance, separation or change-in-control benefits or features) that are in the aggregate no less favorable than the cash

benefit plan of Parent or vesting or other benefits under any equity incentive plan) under any employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
(such benefits, the “Parent Plans”), Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with Anaplan or its subsidiaries before
the Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar benefit plan of Anaplan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, Parent will, subject in each case to receipt of any required consent of the applicable Parent Plan provider, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable benefit plans of Anaplan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each
Continuing Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket

Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Anaplan that:
•
Parent has delivered to Anaplan a true, accurate and complete copy of the fully executed Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Sponsor has committed to invest the amounts set forth therein.
•
The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Anaplan is a third party beneficiary thereof.
•
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub. As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated. As of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any respect.
•
The Equity Commitment Letter is the only agreement relating to the Equity Financing as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Other than as
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements, conditions precedent or
other contingencies relating to the Equity Commitment Letter that would reasonably be expected to impair the amount, availability or
conditionality of the Equity Financing.
•
As of the date of the Merger Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, under any term of the Equity Commitment Letter or, would (i) make any
of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) result in any of
the conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Equity Financing not being available on the
closing date. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to each party’s obligation to effect the merger and the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter will fail to be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the
Equity Financing will not be available to be funded at the Effective Time.
•
The aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and are sufficient in amount for Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to pay the
Merger Consideration payable for all shares of Anaplan common stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, any other amounts required to be paid at the closing in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement(including any and all payments with respect to Company Stock Options or Company RSUs payable under the
Merger Agreement at closing) and, together with the Company’s cash on hand as of the closing date, all associated fees, costs and
expenses in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Equity
Financing, in each case, to the extent required to be paid on the closing date (collectively, the Required Amount, as defined in the section of
this Proxy Statement captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger—Equity Financing”). The only conditions precedent related to the
obligations of Sponsor to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing are expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed to use its (and has agreed to cause certain affiliates to use their) reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable and obtain the proceeds of the Equity Financing on
the terms and conditions, described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to:
•
comply with and maintain in effect the Equity Financing and the Equity Commitment Letter;
104Table of Contents

satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy, as promptly as practicable and on a timely basis all conditions to the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter that are within its control (subject to and without expanding any of Parent’s or
Merger Sub’s express obligations under the Merger Agreement);
•
comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter; and
•
enforce its rights (other than through litigation) under the Equity Commitment Letter.
Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement, termination, modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under the Equity Commitment Letter that would impact the amount or timing of the Equity Financing or the
availability of the Equity Financing at the closing, in each case, in a manner that would adversely affect Parent’s ability to fund the Required Amount at
the closing, without the prior written consent of Anaplan.
Anaplan, at Parent’s sole expense, has agreed to, and has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries to, use its and their respective reasonable best
efforts to provide such cooperation in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the debt financing for the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (the “Debt Financing”) as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, as is necessary and customary in
connection with the arrangement of debt financings; provided that such requested cooperation is consistent with applicable law and does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Anaplan or any of its subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include:

to allow Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to satisfy the conditions in any definitive documentation in respect of the Debt Financing

disclosures regarding Anaplan and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, for use in

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement as violative of any antitrust law, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the closing
on or before the Outside Date, including defending through litigation any claim asserted in any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division or any other applicable governmental authority or any private party
under any antitrust law; and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law so as to enable the closing to occur as soon as
possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing, or disposition of such businesses, product lines, equity holdings, technology, intellectual
property, or other assets of Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Company or its subsidiaries after the closing) and (B) otherwise taking or committing

the businesses, product lines, equity interests, technology, intellectual property, or other assets of Parent or the Company and/or their respective
subsidiaries (each of the impediments set forth in the preceding clauses (A) and (B), an “Antitrust Restraint”); provided, however, that (x) Parent shall not
be required to agree to any Antitrust Restraint that, individually or in the aggregate, would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Material
Adverse Effect, and (y) Parent shall not be required to agree to any Antitrust Restraint that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
During the period beginning on the date of the Merger Agreement through the date on which the condition in the Merger Agreement with respect
to obtaining antitrust approvals is satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire,
by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business
or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to: (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any governmental authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under any antitrust
law; (ii) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority seeking or entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise.

Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather each is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and

Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We
have also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time

time to time and may have invested in limited partnership interests of affiliates of the Significant Stockholders or Thoma Bravo from time to time and may
do so in the future.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including
the prospectus contained therein dated October 10, 2018 relating to the Company’s initial public offering; annual reports to stockholders and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2021; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for
the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the
Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the
past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the
Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets
and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we
have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way
meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This
opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of
the $66.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address,
any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the $66.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of
volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or
viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come

Members of the Board:
We understand that Anaplan, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Alpine Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”),
and Alpine Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), plan to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of March 20, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the “Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company Common
Stock”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined
in the Merger Agreement), (b) Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) held in the treasury of the Company or (c) Company
Shares owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount equal to $66.00, without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are
more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March 20, 2022 (the “Draft Merger
Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.
We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial
condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity
for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock
with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly
available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
we have deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections,
we have been advised by the

management of the Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company, that they have
been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future
financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ
materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of
the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we
have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and
products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which will
become payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date
hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which compensation was
received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial
services to the Company or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective
affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the
Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company
Common Stock will trade at any time.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of,
the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.

(i) Each Vested Company Stock Option and each Additional Vesting Company Stock Option will be cancelled and converted
into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company Stock Option or Additional Vesting Company Stock Option) by (B) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Vested Company Stock Option or Additional Vesting Company Stock Option

become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Merger Consideration by (B) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU or Additional Vesting Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Vested Company RSU Consideration”). The payment of the Vested Company RSU Consideration will be subject to withholding for all
required Taxes.

exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting

provided in this Section 2.7(b)(ii), all Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the Unvested
Company RSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or

shares subject thereto, and (y) such Company Performance RSU shall be deemed an Unvested Company RSU with respect to two-thirds (2/3) of the
shares subject thereto (with fifty percent (50%) of such Unvested Company RSU to vest subject to the RSU Holder’s continued service with Parent or its
subsidiaries on each of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2024).

applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will

and validly perfected their statutory rights of

appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (collectively, “Dissenting Company Shares”) shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
the stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section
2.9.
(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or
offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”), which shall provide for the payment by the Paying Agent of the
amounts payable under Section 2.6(a) in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.9. On the Closing Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a); provided that Parent shall not be required to make
available to the Paying Agent any Merger Consideration for Dissenting Company Shares until such time as any holders thereof shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL (the
“Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article 2, and to the extent that there are net losses with respect to
any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.
No investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent. The Surviving Corporation
shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of funds to holders of
Company Shares.
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of book-entry shares representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Book-Entry
Shares”), in each case whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a), (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
A-16Table of Contents
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 2. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred, and the
person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal and reasonable exchange practices.
(c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.
(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its affiliates, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect
of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) two years after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.
(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct (consistent with the policies and practices of the Paying Agent) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject to such person’s compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.9(b) (other than the
surrender of a Certificate), issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or

properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so

under this Agreement (a “Parent Material Adverse Effect”).

deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of an executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the
date of this Agreement, by and among Parent and Sponsor, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the “Equity Commitment
Letter”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, Sponsor has committed to provide the amounts set forth therein to Parent
for the purpose of funding the Required Amount (such committed equity financing, the “Equity Financing”).
(b) (i) As of the date of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and (ii) the Equity Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and Sponsor, enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its
terms except as enforceability may be affected by applicable Enforceability Limitations. The Equity Commitment Letter is the only agreement relating to
the Equity Financing as of the date of this Agreement. Other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are no other agreements,
side letters, or arrangements, conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the Equity Commitment Letter that would reasonably be expected to
impair the amount, availability or conditionality of the Equity Financing. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-
party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter in connection with Company’s exercise of its rights under Section 9.6.
(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, under any term of the Equity Commitment Letter or, would (i) make any of the
assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in
the Equity Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Equity Financing not being available on the Closing Date. Assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter will fail to be satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amount of the Equity Financing will not
be available to be funded at the Effective Time.
(d) The aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions, and are sufficient in amount for Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to pay the Merger Consideration payable for all
Company Shares in connection with the Transaction, any other amounts required to be paid at Closing in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (including any and all payments with respect to Company Stock Options or Company RSUs payable under this Agreement at Closing) and,
together with the Company’s cash on hand as of the Closing Date, all associated fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions, including the Equity Financing, in each case, to the extent required to be paid on the Closing Date (collectively, the “Required Amount”).
The only conditions precedent related to the obligations of Sponsor to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing are expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter.

their Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; or (c) take any action to render any provision of any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control
share acquisition,” “business combination” or other similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company’s organizational documents, in each case inapplicable to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to
terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions). Any violation of
the restrictions on the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth in this Section 6.2(a)(i) by any officer or director, or any other Representative
(solely to the extent authorized, sanctioned or caused by the Company or any Company Subsidiary), of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
deemed a breach of this Section 6.2(a)(i) by the Company.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of Section 6.2(a)(i) that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is, or would reasonably likely lead to, a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.2(a)(ii), (x) furnish information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition

Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such information has previously been made
available to Parent or is made available to Parent prior to or promptly following the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the
extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may, solely to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, not enforce
any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other
party to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal that will constitute, or would reasonably likely lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did not, in
each case, result from a material breach by the Company of Section 6.2(a)(i).
(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a Third
Party that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party’s (or its stockholders’) owning, directly or indirectly, greater than 80% of the equity
securities of the Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or greater
than 80% of the assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the
Company Board) and that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel if
consummated, is likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and is more favorable to the Company’s stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the Merger, taking into account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other terms and conditions of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise).
(b) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 6.2, until the earlier of the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by
the Company Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions (the “Company Board Recommendation”), (B) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) business days of the commencement
of such offer, (C) fail to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days after the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer or public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after written request from Parent to do so, (D) approve, recommend
or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, or (E) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(E), a “Change in Recommendation”), or (y) adopt, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar Contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (any of the foregoing, an
“Acquisition Agreement”).
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company Board may at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained if a material event, fact, development, circumstance or
occurrence that affects or would be reasonably likely to affect the business, assets or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was
not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (or, if known or reasonably foreseeable, the
consequences of which are not known to or

understood by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement) becomes known by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement or the
material consequences thereof become known to or understood by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained (an “Intervening Event”) (provided that the mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any
internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on
or after the date of this Agreement, or changes after the date of this Agreement in the market price of the Company Common Stock or the credit rating of

Recommendation; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect a Change in Recommendation due to an Intervening Event unless (y) the
Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of its intention to take such action, and prior to
effecting such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such five (5) business day period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary (and in the event of any material change to the circumstances related to the
Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in this proviso and a renewed
negotiation period under this proviso shall commence (except that the five (5) business day period shall instead be equal to two (2) business days;
provided that if such additional notice is delivered during the initial five (5) business day negotiation period, the initial negotiation period shall not be
reduced by such notice)), and (z) following such notice period (including any subsequent notice period), the Company Board shall have concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor and taking into account Parent’s proposed adjustments (if any) to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation due to an Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and provided, further, that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section
6.2(b)(ii) with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to Section 6.2(b)(iii)).
(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was made after the date of this Agreement and
did not result from a material breach of Section 6.2(a)(i), (A) make a Change in Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to make such Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(f) and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to so terminate this
Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement unless (y) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in
advance of its intention to take such action (a “Notice of Designated Superior Proposal”), and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate with Parent
in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Change
in Recommendation is no longer necessary and such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal (and in the event of any material
change to any of the terms (including any change to the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) of such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in this proviso and a renewed negotiation period under this
proviso shall commence (except that the five (5) business day period shall instead be equal to two (2) business days; provided that if such additional
notice is delivered during the initial five (5) business day negotiation

period, the initial negotiation period shall not be reduced by such notice)), and (z) following such notice period (including any subsequent notice period),
the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisor and financial advisor and taking into account
Parent’s proposed adjustments (if any) to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless substantially concurrently with such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with subclause (z) of Section 8.3(a).
(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the Company would reasonably expect
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any such written Acquisition Proposal and any related agreements,
documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith that are material to such Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is
provided orally to the Company or its Representatives, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of such Acquisition Proposal (including for the
avoidance of doubt any such request or other inquiry), except (and solely to the extent) such notification and/or disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a
confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party as of the date of this Agreement, and thereafter shall (i) keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of any material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposals or any material change
to the terms and status of any such Acquisition Proposal or the process associated with such proposals or offers and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
to the terms and status of any such Acquisition Proposal or the process associated with such proposals or offers and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material correspondence and other
substantive written material sent or provided to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives from any person
that described any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.
(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or
under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the
stockholders); provided, that (A) this Section 6.2(d) shall not be deemed to affect whether any such disclosure, other than a “stop, look and listen”
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, would otherwise be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation and
(B) any such disclosure pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 6.2(d) shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company
Board and the rights of Parent under this Section 6.2. For clarity, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, that the Company Board is considering the Acquisition Proposal, that no position has been taken by the Company Board as to the
advisability or desirability of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed a Change in
Recommendation.
(e) Proxy Filing; Information Supplied.
(i) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after, and in any event within
twenty (20) business days after, the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Proxy Statement”). Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.2(b), the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation and, unless there has been a Change in
A-48
Table of Contents
Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.2(b), the Company will continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote
including the solicitation of proxies therefor.
(ii) The Company will provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of
the Proxy Statement and other documents related to the Stockholders Meeting (as defined below) prior to filing such documents with the applicable
Governmental Authority and mailing such documents to the Company’s stockholders. The Company will consider in good faith for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and such other documents related to the Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent or its legal counsel
and the Company agrees that all information relating to Parent and its subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (A) will not on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (B) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their
affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (which Parent shall ensure satisfies the requirements of clauses (A)-(B) of the
preceding sentence) and (2) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates assume no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by
or on behalf of the Company or its affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by a party, which information
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and the Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent)
and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company agrees to cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Law.
(iii) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and without limiting the generality of the
undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.2(e), will (i) promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement, (ii) provide Parent, its financial advisors and legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Company’s proposed
response to such comments, (iii) consider in good faith any comments proposed by Parent, its financial advisors and legal counsel and (iv) provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC (or portions of any such meetings that relate
to the Proxy Statement). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the
date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.
(iv) Subject to compliance with the terms of Section 6.2, in connection with any disclosure regarding a Change in
Recommendation relating to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall not be required to provide to Parent or Merger Sub the opportunity to review or
comment on (or include comments proposed by Parent or Merger Sub in), or permit Parent or Merger Sub to participate in any discussions with the SEC
regarding, the Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments thereon or any other filing by the Company with the SEC, in
each case, solely with respect to such disclosure.

(f) Stockholders Meeting.
(i) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
of mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement (provided that, subject to the sentence that follows, the Stockholders Meeting shall not be held later than
forty-five (45) days following confirmation from the SEC that it will not review or that it has completed its review of the Proxy Statement (which
confirmation will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the tenth calendar day after filing the Proxy Statement
that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement)), for the purposes of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote. The Company may postpone
or adjourn such meeting (A) to the extent required by applicable Law (including to permit the filing and dissemination of any supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required under applicable
Law), (B) if on a date that is two (2) business days prior to the date the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (the “Original Meeting Date”), the Company
has not received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business days in connection with any one postponement or adjournment or by more than an
aggregate of forty-five (45) days from the Original Meeting Date in reliance on this clause (B), (C) within the three (3) business days prior to the Original
Meeting Date or any date that the Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, if the Company delivers (or has delivered) a notice of an intent to
make a Change in Recommendation, as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business days,
or (D) with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(ii) Once the Company has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the Company will not change such record
date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1, and, to the extent required by the terms of this Agreement, the Company has paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 8.3, its obligations to hold the Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.2 and submit this Agreement to the Company’s
stockholders for purposes of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote shall not be affected in any manner, including in connection with (i) the making of a
Change in Recommendation by the Company Board or (ii) the commencement of or announcement or disclosure of or communication to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal.
(iii) Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of
this Agreement will be the only matter (other than related procedural matters) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the Company’s
stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

(a) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board will adopt (and will cause
any other sponsor of the applicable Company Benefit Plan to adopt), at least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, resolutions terminating
any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later
than the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b)
of the Code) or group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries or
A-50Table of Contents
any other applicable Company Benefit Plan sponsor, as applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such
401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request.
(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Continuing Employee may have under any Company Benefit Plan and subject to
Section 6.3(d), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its applicable subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for any Continuing Employee during his or her employment (i) cash compensation levels (such term to
include salary and wages, target short-term cash bonus opportunities and commission formulas but to exclude long-term cash compensation, any equity
or equity-based compensation and severance, separation or change-in-control benefits or features) that are in the aggregate no less favorable than the
cash compensation levels provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity or
equity-based benefits, defined benefit pension, retiree welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to such employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or
frozen benefit plan of Parent or vesting or other benefits under any equity incentive plan) under any employee benefits provided to similarly-situated
employees (such benefits, the “Parent Plans”), Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company before the
Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, Parent will, subject in each case to receipt of any required consent of the applicable Parent Plan provider, us
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Continuing
Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any Parent Plan.
(d) Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms the executive agreements
listed on Section 6.3(d) of the Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Time.
(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such
persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan or any employee or service provider program or
arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time), or (y) constitute or be
construed to constitute an amendment to any of the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to employees or other persons prior to or
following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any such plans or
arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time).

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of the Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
favor of any Indemnified Person (the “Indemnification Agreements”) (and all other indemnification agreements of the Company that are on terms
substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that such
obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide officers’ and directors’ liability, fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Company’s
D&O Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA; provided, that, in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 6.4(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the aggregate in excess of 400% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on Section 6.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (provided that if the annual premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous policies available
for an annual premium equal to such amount). In furtherance of and subject to the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a
“tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and premium
amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such
insurance Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.4(b) shall be deemed satisfied for so long
as such insurance is in full force and effect and covers the matters that would otherwise be covered pursuant to this Section 6.4(b); Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not cancel any D&O Insurance (including any “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy) during its term.
(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.4 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to which each Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person
to whom this Section 6.4 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this Section 6.4.
(d) If (1) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person or (2) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees on
behalf of itself and its respective affiliates that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather each is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, is payable for the efforts, expenses and resources expended and opportunity
forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and hereby agrees that the
provisions of this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without such provisions, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company
would have entered into this Agreement.

contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law or otherwise) of Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor and their respective affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general

required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. No Parent Related Party shall be entitled to, and Parent shall not and shall

thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Action pending in connection
with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent
maintained by Parent or any Parent Related Party against the Company or any Company Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following
the payment of the Company Termination Fee, if due, or the final and non-appealable determination that no such payment is due. For the avoidance of
doubt, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that none of the foregoing nor anything else contained in this Agreement is
intended to limit Parent and Merger Sub’s right to seek monetary damages from the Company in the event of the Company’s willful and material breach of
this Agreement in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not payable; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company’s aggregate liability under this Agreement exceed the Company Termination Fee, plus Enforcement Costs (if any).
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement and subject to Section 9.6 prior to the termination of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 8.3, in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable, plus, if applicable, the Enforcement Costs and any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 6.19(d) shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise) of the Company
Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties and any person who pays the Parent Termination Fee on Parent’s behalf for all any and all losses,

Limited Guaranty) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful or intentional, of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such circumstances, and upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if due, to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. No Company Related Party shall be entitled to, and the
Company shall not and shall cause any Company Related Party not to, bring or maintain any Action for money damages against any Parent Related Party
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or Sponsor solely to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty for payment of the Parent Termination Fee and if
applicable, Enforcement Costs and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.19(d), or for any breaches of such person for any breaches of the
Confidentiality Agreement) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including
with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guaranty) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Action
pending in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including with respect to the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Limited Guaranty) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by the Company or any
Company Related Party against Parent or any Parent Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the payment of any such amounts,
if due, or the final and non-appealable determination that no such payment is due. For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate monetary liability
of any Parent Related Party, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, plus Enforcement Costs (if any) and any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 6.19(d) (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto expressly
A-64
Table of Contents
acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of the foregoing nor anything else contained in this Agreement is intended to limit the Company’s right to seek
monetary damages from Parent or Merger Sub in the event of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s willful and material breach of this Agreement in circumstances in
which the Parent Termination Fee is not payable; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent’s or Merger Sub’s aggregate liability
under this Agreement exceed the Parent Liability Limitation, and (ii) this Section 8.3(e) will not limit the rights of the Company under the Confidentiality
Agreement or relieve Parent, Merger Sub or any Sponsor from liability for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent such persons are
party to the Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.6 prior to the termination of this Agreement, except that, although the Company, in
its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies under this Agreement, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with Section 9.6
(and, if the Company elects, doing so concurrently with seeking monetary damages and/or payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated by
Section 9.6 and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. The Lenders and their respective affiliates and any Parent
Related Party are express third party beneficiaries of the provisions of this Section 8.3(e), may enforce this Section 8.3(e) directly, and this Section 8.3(e)
may not be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in any manner adverse to the Lenders or their respective affiliates without the prior
express written consent of the Lenders.
(f) If (i) the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Company Termination Fee due pursuant to Section 8.3(a), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the Company Termination Fee (or a portion thereof) set forth in Section 8.3(a),
the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such payment was
required to be made hereunder or (ii) Parent fails to pay in a timely manner the Parent Termination Fee due pursuant to Section 8.3(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim that results in a judgment for the Parent Termination Fee (or a portion thereof) set forth in Section
8.3(b), Parent shall pay to the Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination Fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such payment was
required to be made hereunder (as applicable, the “Enforcement Costs”).

Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the parties to this
Agreement further agrees that no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.6, and each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees not to raise
any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, and (B) the specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at equity or Law, or any similar grounds. For the avoidance of doubt, the
remedies available to the Company under this Section 9.6 of the Merger Agreement and under the Equity Commitment Letter shall be in addition to any
other remedy to which the Company is entitled, and the election to pursue any injunction or specific performance under this Section 9.6 and/or the Equity
Commitment Letter shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from receiving monetary damages from Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement in lieu of specific performance (to the extent permitted hereby); provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated by this Section 9.6 and any money damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. If, prior to the Outside Date, as applicable, any party hereto brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (other than any such terms and provisions that expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement) by any other party hereto, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to the later of (i) 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the twentieth (20th)
business day following the resolution of such Action and (ii) such other date and time established by the court presiding over such Action, as the case
may be, solely if such later date and time is later than the Outside Date.
(c) Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders under any Debt Financing Documentation and the rights of Parent and Merger
Sub under any Debt Financing Documentation, the Company acknowledges and agrees that no Lender Related Party shall have any liability or obligation
to the Company (or any of the Representatives of the Company) in connection with this Agreement or any Transactions if such Lender Related Party
breaches or fails to perform (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of its obligations under the Debt Financing Documentation
and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Representatives of the Company) hereby waives any rights or claims against each Lender Related Party in
connection with this Agreement and the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself
and the Representatives of the Company) agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding
against any Lender Related Party in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction (including any action or proceeding relating to the Debt
Financing). In no event shall the Company (or any of the Representatives of the Company) be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance
of this Agreement against any Lender Related Party.
