ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS INC_20220103_DEFM14A_19751337_4360734.Pdf,The Special Meeting,"The Special Meeting
Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting
A special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be held
virtually on February 2, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ARNA2022SM (the
“Special Meeting”).
At the Special Meeting, stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2021 (the “Record Date”)
will be asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Arena’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”); and
•
a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special
Meeting, and only matters specified in the notice of the meeting may be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
You are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the
close of business on the Record Date. Each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each such
share of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date on all matters properly coming before the
Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 61,564,122 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. A quorum is necessary to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Compensation
Proposal. A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the Special Meeting for the meeting to
be properly held under our bylaws and Delaware law. The holders of a majority of the common stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, present virtually or represented by proxy, will
constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Your shares of common stock will be counted towards the quorum only if
you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee), if you vote at
the meeting or if you attend the Special Meeting but abstain from voting. The Special Meeting may be adjourned
whether or not a quorum is present.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of
the close of business on the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the required vote for
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the number of votes our stockholders are entitled to cast
rather than on the number of votes actually cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy or vote online at the meeting, abstain
from voting at the meeting, or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as
votes cast “AGAINST” the merger proposal. As of December 30, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting,
30,782,062 shares constitute a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal each require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is
not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder
abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal but will be used to determine whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result,
an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum, but will only count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs
when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,
broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.
“Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However,
because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have
discretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. As such, if you
fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted towards
a quorum at the Special Meeting.",11,11

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the

outstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 2.98% of the shares of common stock outstanding when taking

At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the parties or any stockholder, each share of
common stock then outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) common stock owned by
Arena as treasury stock, (ii) common stock owned by Pfizer or Merger Sub and (iii) any common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section
262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and have properly exercised and perfected
their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL
and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment
under the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”)) will be cancelled and cease to exist and automatically converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount equal to $100.00, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any
withholding of taxes.

Delaware law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Appraisal
Rights.”
Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs

Plans”) awards of options to purchase shares of common stock (each, an “Arena Option”), restricted stock units
covering shares of common stock subject to vesting conditions based solely on continued employment or service to
Arena or any of its subsidiaries (each such restricted stock unit, an “Arena RSU”) and restricted stock units covering
shares of common stock that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions (each, an “Arena PRSU”). The
Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, each:
(i)
Arena Option granted that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-
share exercise price of such Arena Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such
Arena Option;
(ii)
Arena RSU, except as described in subclause (iii) below, subject to vesting conditions based solely on
continued employment or service to Arena or any of its subsidiaries that is unvested and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration;
(iii) Arena RSU that is granted after December 12, 2021 (each, a “2022 Arena RSU”) that is unvested and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be substituted automatically with a Pfizer
restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Pfizer common stock (each, an “Adjusted
RSU”) that is equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of common stock subject to the 2022
Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Arena RSU Exchange Ratio (as
defined below), with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU will
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in connection with
certain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time), as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”; and
(iv) Arena PRSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration (with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with
such Arena PRSU being deemed achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective
Time or at target).
The “Arena RSU Exchange Ratio” is equal to (i) the Merger Consideration divided by (ii) the average of the volume-
weighted average sales price per share of common stock of Pfizer on the New York Stock Exchange for the
consecutive period of fifteen (15) trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that is four (4) trading days

than the earlier of the last day of the current purchase period of five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, and
immediately following such purchase and contingent on closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), the Arena ESPP will
terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Two (2) of our executive officers currently participate in the
Arena ESPP and have accumulated payroll deductions under the Arena ESPP for the purchase period that

After considering various factors described in this proxy statement under the caption, “The Merger-Recommendation
of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors unanimously: (i) determined that the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Arena and the
stockholders; (ii) approved and declared it advisable to enter into the Merger Agreement; (iii) directed that the
adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (iv)

adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the
Compensation Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to receipt of the required stockholder approval, under certain specified circumstances, the Board of Directors
may withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders in accordance with law. However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing
recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to,
providing Pfizer four (4) business days to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (as
described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-
The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Arena Adverse Recommendation Change”). The termination of the Merger
Agreement by Pfizer following the withdrawal by the Board of Directors of its recommendation that stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement will result in the payment by Arena of the Arena Termination Fee. The termination of
the Merger Agreement by Arena following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Arena to enter into a definitive
agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal (as defined below) will
result in the payment by Arena of the Arena Termination Fee. For more information, please see the section of this

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders who continuously hold shares of Arena
common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively withdraw, fail to perfect or
otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek an appraisal by the
Delaware Court of Chancery of the “fair value” of their shares of Arena common stock (exclusive of any elements of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any), as determined by the court, as described further below in lieu of receiving the
Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed. The amount determined to be fair value by the court will be
determined as of the Effective Time and could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration for
Arena common stock. Voting “AGAINST” or failing to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself
does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares or who wish
to preserve their rights to do so should review Annex D carefully and are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights since failure to timely and fully comply with the procedures set
forth therein will result in the loss of such rights.
To exercise appraisal rights, stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Arena before the
stockholder vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; (ii) not submit a
proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold shares of
Arena common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for
exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under
Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Arena unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the
stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail
in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement. If
you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more information, please

The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders (as defined under the caption, “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for shares of Arena common stock in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by each of our stockholders
that is a U.S. Holder generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if
any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger. Backup withholding taxes may also apply to the cash
payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures under the
backup withholding rules.
An stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption, “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the
United States but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain
certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Arena’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement has not contributed to the making of such
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders in accordance with law, (A) effect an Arena Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined below) or (B) terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (as defined below) with respect to such Superior Proposal.

Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting virtually and vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Stockholders of Record and Beneficial Owners. Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the
Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you do not need to do
anything in advance to attend and/or vote your shares at the Special Meeting, but to attend the Special

10TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $100.00 in cash,
without interest thereon and subject to any withholding of taxes, for each share of common stock that you own
immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you are entitled to and have properly exercised and not
withdrawn, failed to perfect or otherwise lost your appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. For example,
if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $10,000.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of
common stock, subject to any withholding of taxes. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the
Surviving Corporation.
Q:
What will holders of Arena stock awards receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, each:
(i)
Arena Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested,
will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-
share exercise price of such Arena Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such
Arena Option;
(ii)
Arena RSU, except as described in subclause (iii) below, subject to vesting conditions based solely on
continued employment or service to Arena or any of its subsidiaries that is unvested and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration;
(iii) 2022 Arena RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
substituted automatically with an Adjusted RSU that is equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares subject to the 2022 Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Arena
RSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU
will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in connection with
certain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time); and
(iv) Arena PRSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration (with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with
such Arena PRSU being deemed achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective
Time or at target).
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs.”
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. In order to complete the Merger, Arena
must obtain the Requisite Vote described in this proxy statement, and the other closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions,
including obtaining the Requisite Vote, Arena is currently targeting to consummate the Merger in the first half of
2022, although Arena cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Since the Merger is subject to a
number of conditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Arena will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered
under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified
circumstances, Arena will be required to pay Pfizer the Arena Termination Fee upon the termination of the
Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement-Effect of Termination; Termination Fees.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding
as of the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed
proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card); or (iii) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Arena to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote
with respect to certain payments that may be paid or could become payable to certain of its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or
appropriate?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to
approve the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, and the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Arena. Therefore, if the
other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the
Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Arena’s named executive officers in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What is a “broker non-vote”?
A:
Under the rules of Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for
customers have the authority to vote on “discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions
from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their
voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of
Arena common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of
Arena common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as “broker non-votes.” Because
none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have
discretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects
you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided
in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. Under Delaware law, stockholders of record who continuously hold shares of common stock through the
Effective Time and do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal
of the “fair value” of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed.
Appraisal rights will only be available to stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a
written demand for an appraisal to Arena prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL,
which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less
than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Appraisal Rights.”
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within three (3) business days, after
the Effective Time, describing how you should surrender your shares of common stock for the Merger
Consideration. If your shares of Arena common stock are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect
the surrender of your “street name” shares of Arena common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.
Q:
What should I do if I have lost my stock certificate?
A:
If you have lost your stock certificate, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at
(800) 962-4284 or web.queries@computershare.com to obtain replacement certificates.
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and
written instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder’s book-
entry shares for Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Arena in writing of such
special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,
to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the
Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with
respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the
Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in
the enclosed proxy card).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Arena.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by
your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.
However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares virtually at the Special
Meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or
Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting at the meeting.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting
electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will
be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of
common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you
beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock virtually at the Special Meeting even if you
have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote virtually, your previous vote
by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the
Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,
you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Arena; or
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually.
If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote virtually at the Special Meeting
if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.”
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal;
and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
If available, Arena may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. Arena
intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the
Special Meeting. All reports that Arena files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:

risks related to diverting management’s attention from Arena’s ongoing business operations; and
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Pfizer or against Arena related to the
Merger Agreement or the proposed Merger.
The risks and uncertainties may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic (and related variants), which has caused
significant economic uncertainty. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic (and related variants) impacts Arena’s
businesses, operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on
numerous factors, which are unpredictable, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its
severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and
operating conditions can resume. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the
foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the businesses of Pfizer and Arena described in the
“Risk Factors” section of their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other
documents filed by either of them from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are
cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Arena assumes no obligation to, and does
not intend to, update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise, unless required by law. Arena gives no assurance that it will achieve its expectations.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including: (i) the information contained under this caption;
and (ii) the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors,” and information in our consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020

filed with the SEC from time to time and available at www.sec.gov. No assurance can be given that these are all of the
factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (i) adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) approve the Adjournment
Proposal.
We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the Special
Meeting, and only matters specified in the notice of the meeting may be acted upon at the Special Meeting.
Our stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement in order for the Merger to be
consummated. If our stockholders fail to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not
be consummated. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we urge

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal
executive offices located at 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204, Park City, Utah 84060, during regular business hours for a
period of no less than ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and will be available electronically at the Special
Meeting.
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present virtually or
represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 61,564,122
shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, meaning that 30,782,062 shares of
common stock must be represented virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. In the event that a
quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional
proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of
the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, 30,782,062 shares constitute a
majority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a
condition to the Closing.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve
the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory (non-binding) basis.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve
the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.
An abstention represents a stockholder’s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder
abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or
Adjournment Proposal but will be used to determine whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result,
an abstention of any of the aforementioned proposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or
absence of a quorum, but will only count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any Adjournment Proposal. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs
when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank,
broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the
17TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares. “Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
However, because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are routine matters for which brokers
may have discretionary authority to vote, Arena does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. As
such, if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, your shares will not be
counted towards a quorum at the Special Meeting.
Shares Held by Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 107,992 shares of common stock, representing approximately 0.18% of the shares of common stock
outstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 2.98% of the shares of common stock outstanding when taking
into account Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive
officers).
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their respective shares
of common stock (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal, and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of
the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted:
(i)
“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding)
basis, of the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually with a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or

your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not
vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the
Special Meeting and vote virtually with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same

ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS INC_20220103_DEFM14A_19751337_4360734.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board of Directors, together with Arena senior management, and with the assistance of its outside advisors,
frequently reviews Arena’s strategic and financial alternatives in light of developments in Arena’s business, the
sectors in which it operates, and the economy and financial markets generally, as they, individually and together, may
affect Arena’s long-term strategic goals and plans. Since early 2020, this assessment has also been informed by the
current and prospective impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new variants of the
coronavirus that causes COVID-19. As part of this process, members of Arena’s senior management have engaged in
business development and strategic discussions with participants in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries,
all with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders, including by delivering the best possible treatments and
services to patients and healthcare providers. Arena’s strategic discussions have focused on, among other things,
strategic opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, licensing transactions, commercial agreements and
other financial and strategic alternatives for Arena, including continuing as a standalone company, with a view to
enhance stockholder value.
On October 22, 2021, Mr. Amit D. Munshi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arena, and Dr. Albert Bourla,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, held a video conference that had been scheduled earlier that week at
the request of Dr. Bourla. Dr. Bourla stated that Pfizer would be interested in acquiring Arena and would be prepared
to execute a transaction by the end of the quarter but did not preview any valuation information. During the call, Dr.
Bourla requested that Arena provide any available data for its ongoing ELEVATE UC-12 trial and ELEVATE UC- 52
trials that might inform Pfizer's proposal. Mr. Munshi responded that only blinded data would be available before the
end of the year. Dr. Bourla concluded the conversation by noting that he would follow up with Mr. Munshi as soon
as possible. Later that day, Mr. Munshi informed Dr. Garry Neil, Chairman of the Board of Directors, of his
conversation with Dr. Bourla.
On October 27, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that it was challenging for Pfizer to make a written proposal
before reviewing the blinded ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 data. Dr. Bourla asked whether Arena would
provide the information if Pfizer submitted a written letter of intent, exclusive of any price per share or other
22TABLE OF CONTENTS
valuation information. Mr. Munshi stated that Arena would not do so. Dr. Bourla asked Mr. Munshi to identify a price
that would be sufficient for Arena to provide the requested information. Mr. Munshi declined to do so and indicated
that he believed any proposal would need to be substantially higher than the 52-week intraday high of the trading
price for shares of Arena common stock (which was $90.19 for the 52-week period ending October 27, 2021) in order
to be considered by the Board of Directors. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer would send a written proposal to Arena
the next day. Mr. Munshi confirmed that he would notify the Board of Directors of receipt of such written proposal.
On October 28, 2021, Pfizer sent Arena an indication of interest, dated October 27, 2021, pursuant to which Pfizer
proposed to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of Arena for $98.00 per share in cash (which we refer to
as the “October 27 Proposal”).
On October 29, 2021, Mr. Munshi informed Dr. Bourla that the Board of Directors would meet later that day to discuss
the October 27 Proposal. Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla discussed the appropriate contacts at Arena and Pfizer to
coordinate the negotiation and execution of a non-disclosure agreement if authorized by the Board of Directors.
Later that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley
LLP (“Cooley”), Arena’s outside legal counsel. During the meeting, Mr. Munshi described his conversations with Dr.
Bourla and the October 27 Proposal. Representatives from Cooley summarized fiduciary duties attendant to any
review of strategic alternatives, and Mr. Munshi reviewed a summary of certain publicly available financial
information prepared by Guggenheim Securities (from which no representatives were present at the meeting)
regarding certain similar acquisition transactions. The Board of Directors and Arena senior management then
discussed the price proposed by Pfizer in the October 27 Proposal and how it compared to premiums previously paid
by Pfizer and to premiums paid in similar recent pre-commercial biopharmaceutical transactions. The Board of
Directors also discussed the inherent uncertainties in Arena’s business as a standalone company (including those
relating to the ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 trials expected to read out in 2022), the premium to Arena’s
current stock price represented by the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal and considerations for assessing
strategic alternatives at that time, including the need for an assessment of Arena’s standalone plan and future
outlook in order to assess the relative merits of Arena continuing to operate independently and pursuing its current
business and financial plans on a standalone basis. The Board of Directors also noted that a draft of Arena’s Long
Range Plan was scheduled to be reviewed by the Board of Directors the following week. Based on the discussion at
this meeting, the Board of Directors determined that although it would expect to seek to negotiate a higher price per
share if it were to consider entering into a transaction with Pfizer, it was advisable to permit Pfizer to proceed with
limited due diligence in order to allow it to improve its proposal. Accordingly, the Board of Directors approved
entering into a non-disclosure agreement with Pfizer and providing limited diligence through a management
presentation, including a summary of the blinded ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 data requested by Dr. Bourla.
The Board of Directors further directed Arena senior management to update and finalize Arena’s Long Range Plan for
review by the Board of Directors at its next meeting.
At this meeting, the Board of Directors also discussed the potential benefits and risks associated with contacting
additional third parties regarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena and which third parties could
reasonably be expected to have both financial ability and strategic interest in a potential transaction with Arena,
including third parties that previously expressed interest in Arena’s business. The Board of Directors determined to
proceed with initial, preliminary outreach to selected third parties and authorized Arena senior management to
contact Party A, a pharmaceutical company, at that time. The Board of Directors discussed reaching out to Party B,
another pharmaceutical company, and determined based on recent discussions that because Party B was more
interested in a collaboration agreement than a potential transaction to acquire Arena, it would not be advisable to
reach out to Party B. The Board of Directors also directed Arena senior management to prepare additional information
regarding third parties that could potentially be contacted for further discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Later that day, following the Board of Directors meeting, Mr. Vincent Aurentz, Executive Vice President and Chief
Business Officer of Arena, contacted representatives of Party A to inquire as to whether Party A would have interest
in acquiring Arena. At the end of the call, Party A indicated they would contact Mr. Aurentz in the coming days.
On October 30, 2021, at the request of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities provided information about its
relationships with Pfizer over the last five years. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities had verbally summarized
this information for Arena senior management before the meeting of the Board of Directors the prior day. The
information provided by Guggenheim Securities indicated that during the five year period prior to October 30, 2021,
Guggenheim Securities had been engaged by Pfizer with respect to various matters unrelated to the Merger in
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
respect of which Guggenheim Securities received compensation, including five separate completed transactions on
which Guggenheim Securities acted on behalf of Pfizer during this period. The information further indicated
Guggenheim Securities received compensation of approximately $110 million to $115 million in the aggregate from
Pfizer during this five year period. The Board of Directors had discussed the verbal summary of this information at its
October 29 meeting and decided to further review at a subsequent meeting what role, if any, would be appropriate for
Guggenheim Securities in connection with the proposed transaction. The Board of Directors then instructed Arena
senior management to consider an additional financial advisor for consideration by the Board of Directors.
On October 31, 2021, Arena and Pfizer entered into an amendment to an existing non-disclosure agreement between
Arena and Pfizer that was previously entered into in connection with a potential licensing transaction that was
subsequently abandoned. The amendment included a standstill provision for a 12 month period and a non-solicit
provision for a six month period. The standstill provision included customary exclusions, including to permit Pfizer to
approach Arena privately and a fall away provision upon the entry into or public announcement of certain
acquisition transactions.
On November 1, 2021, Arena held a management presentation for Pfizer during which Arena presented limited
diligence information related to the safety, efficacy and competitive landscape of etrasimod, including blinded data
available with respect to the ongoing ELEVATE UC-12 and ELEVATE UC-52 trials and completed trials relating to
ulcerative colitis, or “UC,” and atopic dermatitis, or “AD”.
The same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley to
discuss the engagement of one or more financial advisors. Arena senior management invited Evercore to the meeting
to receive advice from an additional financial advisor regarding Pfizer’s proposal and a potential strategic transaction
and to evaluate their experience and capabilities relevant to a potential strategic transaction. After discussions, the
Board of Directors directed Arena senior management in an executive session at which Evercore was not present to
begin negotiating engagement letters with each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities for consideration by the
Board at a subsequent meeting.
On November 2, 2021, Ms. Deborah Baron, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Business Development and Mr. Shay
Tamari, Business Development Group Lead, Inflammation & Immunology from Pfizer contacted Mr. Aurentz following
the initial management presentation held on November 1, 2021 to provide feedback and request certain additional due
diligence information. In response to such request, Mr. Aurentz indicated that additional due diligence information
would be made available only upon receipt of a revised indication of interest from Pfizer reflecting an increased price
per share from the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal.
On November 3, 2021, a representative from Party A contacted Mr. Aurentz to inform Arena that Party A would not be
able to pursue a transaction with Arena at that time due to its focus on other strategic priorities.
Later that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of Evercore summarized for the Board of Directors their
recommendations regarding a strategic process designed to maximize value for Arena stockholders and presented
their preliminary views on value. The Board of Directors then reviewed Arena’s Long Range Plan, which included the
Projections. For a detailed discussion of the Projections, please see below under the caption “The Merger-Financial
Projections”. In connection with reviewing the Long Range Plan, the Board of Directors engaged in further
discussion regarding the uncertainties inherent in Arena’s standalone business plan, including the potential
outcomes of clinical trials and the resulting ability to access adequate capital depending on those outcomes, and
uncertainties in remaining a standalone business. The Board of Directors then directed Evercore and Guggenheim
Securities to use the Projections in materials presented to the Board of Directors, including as part of any valuation
analysis. Mr. Aurentz informed the Board of Directors that (i) Party A had declined to consider a potential transaction
with Arena and (ii) Pfizer had requested to have access to additional diligence information and that in response to
such request, he indicated that additional information would only be made available upon an increase in price per
share from the price proposed in the October 27 Proposal. The Board of Directors further discussed the potential
benefits and risks associated with contacting additional third parties regarding their potential interest in a transaction
with Arena, including by reviewing a summary prepared by Arena senior management and Evercore and Guggenheim
Securities of additional third parties and considerations relevant to their potential interest in a transaction with Arena.
On November 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities
provided a process update and presented their perspectives on the current biopharmaceutical market environment as
24

well as their preliminary financial analyses. During the subsequent executive session of the meeting at which
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities were not present, the Board of Directors continued to discuss the potential
strategic transaction, including the potential benefits and risks associated with contacting additional third parties
regarding potential interest in a transaction with Arena, as well as alternatives to the potential transaction, including
Arena continuing as a standalone company. The Board of Directors directed Arena senior management to work with
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to target those parties believed most likely to be interested in and able to
acquire Arena. In addition, the Board of Directors determined to formally engage each of Evercore and Guggenheim
Securities in connection with the proposed transaction. In making this determination, the Board of Directors
considered, among other things, Guggenheim Securities’ longstanding relationship and familiarity with Arena’s
business and its knowledge of industry participants as well as Guggenheim Securities’ position as an internationally
recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm. The Board of Directors also considered that
Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm with expertise in
the biopharmaceutical sector that is regularly engaged in the valuation and financial assessment of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, the Board of Directors considered the
disclosure previously provided by Guggenheim Securities regarding its relationships with Pfizer in the past five years
and similar information provided by Evercore, which indicated that Evercore had not been engaged by Pfizer in the
past five years. The Board of Directors discussed the terms of the engagement letters with each of Evercore and
Guggenheim Securities, including the related fees, and approved the terms of the engagements with each of Evercore
and Guggenheim Securities.
Later that day, Arena executed an engagement letter with each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities formalizing the
engagement of each to act as a financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with a potential strategic
transaction.
On November 8, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that Pfizer would make a revised proposal. Later that day,
Pfizer sent Arena a revised indication of interest for $105.00 per share in cash (which we refer to as the “November 8
Proposal”). The November 8 Proposal indicated that it was subject to due diligence, which Pfizer would require
approximately three weeks to complete following receipt of full diligence access.
On November 9, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to discuss the November 8 Proposal. The Board of Directors engaged in
discussion regarding the terms of the November 8 Proposal and determined that although the Board of Directors
would seek to negotiate additional value for Arena stockholders prior to further considering Pfizer’s proposal, the
November 8 Proposal was a basis on which the Board of Directors was willing to allow Pfizer to conduct additional
due diligence to enable it to potentially make an improved proposal. The Board of Directors also further discussed
the potential benefits and risks of contacting additional third parties regarding potential interest in a transaction with
Arena. The Board of Directors directed Arena senior management and representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim
Securities to pursue additional outreach to Party C and Party D, each a pharmaceutical company.
Following the Board of Directors meeting on November 9, 2021, Mr. Munshi indicated to Dr. Bourla that Pfizer would
need to improve the terms of its November 8 Proposal and suggested that in addition to a higher upfront purchase
price, a transaction involving contingent value rights, or “CVRs,” could deliver additional value to Arena
stockholders. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer was not inclined to use CVRs but that it could potentially proposal a
higher price per share depending upon the results of its due diligence. Consistent with the Board of Directors’
determination earlier that day, Mr. Munshi agreed to move forward with providing additional diligence information.
Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla agreed to speak again during the week of November 14, 2021 to further discuss price.
On November 9, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities contacted a representative of Party C
regarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena. Party C indicated they would contact Evercore and
Guggenheim Securities shortly.
On November 10, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities spoke with a representative of Party
D regarding interest in a potential transaction with Arena. The next day, a representative of Party D contacted
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to indicate that Party D was not interested in a potential transaction with Arena
at that time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on November 10, 2021, Pfizer sent Arena an initial due diligence request list, and Arena opened a virtual data
room to Pfizer, which included, among other things, certain information regarding Arena’s intellectual property,
certain tax information items and data and certain other information regarding both historical and ongoing clinical
trials.
On November 11, 2021, Party C contacted representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities and noted that they
were interested in exploring a potential transaction and requested a non-disclosure agreement.
On November 11, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities
informed the Board of Directors that (i) Party D stated that it was not interested in considering a transaction at that
time and (ii) Party C indicated that it was interested in exploring a potential transaction and requested a non-
disclosure agreement. Representatives from Evercore and Guggenheim Securities summarized Party C’s diligence
requests and a request for a management presentation. Arena senior management indicated that it was willing to
share blinded data with a small number of individuals from Party C, in addition to high priority diligence items, so that
Party C would be in a position to submit a preliminary indication of interest. Representatives of each of Evercore and
Guggenheim Securities also informed the Board of Directors that access to the virtual data room had been granted to
Pfizer the previous day.
On November 12, 2021, Arena and Party C executed a non-disclosure agreement, which included a standstill
provision for a 12 month period and a non-solicit provision for a 12 month period. The standstill provision included
customary exclusions such as permitting Party C to approach Arena privately and confidentially and a fall away
provision upon the entry into or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions.
Later that day, certain members of the Arena legal team, along with Cooley and Arena’s outside intellectual property
counsel, held a legal diligence call and an intellectual property diligence call with representatives of Pfizer and Ropes
& Gray LLP (“Ropes & Gray”), Pfizer’s outside legal counsel.
On November 13, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities had a call with Party C where Party C
requested additional diligence information.
On November 15, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke regarding Pfizer’s the November 8 Proposal and deal
process and timing considerations. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer’s due diligence process was ongoing. Also on
November 15, 2021, Party C conducted a diligence call with Arena management with respect to the blinded data and
Arena’s clinical development plans.
On November 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi provided an update on the strategic process and
discussed his November 15, 2021 conversation with Dr. Bourla. Arena senior management then provided an update
regarding Pfizer’s diligence to date. Representatives of each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities summarized the
status of outreach to other third parties regarding a potential transaction, including the status of discussions with
Party C. The Board of Directors discussed the potential benefits and risks of pursuing additional outreach to other
potential buyers, in the pharmaceutical industry. Based on that discussion and the discussion at prior meetings, as
well as the fact that multiple third parties had been contacted to date, the Board of Directors determined not to
contact additional third parties at that time.
The same day, Mr. Munshi emailed Dr. Bourla stating that although Arena and Pfizer were apart on value, Arena
would move forward in negotiations and requested an initial draft of the Merger Agreement.
On November 17, 2021, Ropes & Gray sent an initial draft merger agreement to Cooley. The draft Merger Agreement
proposed, among other things, a one-step merger structure, obligations by Pfizer to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain required regulatory approvals, an unspecified termination fee payable by Arena to Pfizer in certain
circumstances, no reverse termination fee payable by Pfizer to Arena, multiple closing conditions relating to receipt of
regulatory approvals and no carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect relating to the results of
clinical trials. The same day, Arena and Pfizer senior management had a diligence call to discuss trial design and
clinical questions relating to the AD trial.
On November 17, 2021, a representative of Party C contacted representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities
to convey that it would not be submitting an indication of interest at that time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 18, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke regarding the draft merger agreement. Mr. Munshi
summarized for Dr. Bourla certain provisions that were not acceptable to Arena. Dr. Bourla requested that Mr. Munshi
direct Cooley to share a draft merger agreement that would address the concerns raised by Mr. Munshi.
On November 18, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to review the transaction process with Pfizer and the status of outreach
to third parties. Representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities confirmed that Party C had indicated that it
would not be submitting an indication of interest at that time. Representatives of Cooley summarized key terms of the
draft merger agreement provided by Ropes & Gray on November 17, 2021. Mr. Munshi updated the Board of
Directors that he and Dr. Bourla had agreed that Cooley would prepare a revised agreement on behalf of Arena with
terms acceptable to the Board of Directors. Representatives of Cooley discussed with the Board of Directors
considerations regarding certain terms of the merger agreement, including those regarding a tender offer or merger
structure, regulatory efforts obligations, closing conditions, and termination fees. The Board of Directors gave
direction based on this discussion regarding terms to be included in the draft merger agreement being prepared by
Cooley.
On November 19, 2021, Arena issued a press release disclosing that it had achieved its target enrollment in Study A
of the Phase 2/3 CULTIVATE trial for etrasimod.
Later that day, Cooley sent Ropes & Gray a draft merger agreement, which proposed, among other things, a two-step
tender offer transaction structure, an Arena termination fee of 2.25% of the transaction value, regulatory efforts
obligations requiring Pfizer to take all actions necessary or advisable to obtain any required regulatory approvals and
broader carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect, including for adverse events or outcomes of
key clinical trials.
On November 20, 2021, Dr. Bourla indicated to Mr. Munshi that based on its due diligence to date, Pfizer no longer
expected to be able to offer the price indicated in the November 8 Proposal. Dr. Bourla asked Mr. Munshi whether
there might be any alternative transaction structures (such as a license of Arena’s assets outside the United States)
or alternative price structures acceptable to Arena.
On November 21, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi summarized for the Board of Directors his conversation
with Dr. Bourla the previous day. The Board of Directors discussed whether to consider alternative transaction
structures or alternative price structures that could provide additional value to Arena stockholders. Based on this
discussion, it was the consensus of the Board of Directors that Arena should continue to engage in discussions with
Pfizer and that other than a transaction that included CVRs tied to future achievement of certain milestones by the
Arena business, an alternative structure would not be in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders. The Board
of Directors agreed to take a brief recess from the meeting and directed Mr. Munshi to contact Dr. Bourla to indicate
that the Board of Directors would consider a proposal involving CVRs.
During that recess, Mr. Munshi contacted Dr. Bourla to indicate that the Board of Directors would consider a
proposal involving CVRs and that other transaction structures were not of interest to the Board of Directors at that
time. Following that conversation, the meeting of the Board of Directors reconvened and Mr. Munshi summarized his
conversation with Dr. Bourla.
On November 24, 2021, the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was first reported to the World
Health Organization, which designated it as a “Variant of Concern” on November 26, 2021.
That same day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to discuss the transaction process.
On November 26, 2021, Mr. Munshi and Dr. Bourla spoke twice. During these conversations, Dr. Bourla informed Mr.
Munshi that Pfizer did not expect to be able to offer the amount proposed in the November 8 Proposal based on the
results of its due diligence review, which remained ongoing. Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer was willing to continue to
evaluate a transaction at a price of $95.00 per share plus a per share CVR or at a price of $100.00 per share without
CVRs.
On November 27, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi updated the Board of Directors on his conversations with
Dr. Bourla the previous day. The Board of Directors discussed whether to continue discussions
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with Pfizer, taking into account, among other things, Mr. Munshi’s most recent conversations with Dr. Bourla, the
inherent uncertainties in remaining a standalone company, including the potential outcomes of clinical trials, the
resulting ability to access capital depending on those outcomes, the recent lack of interest expressed by Party C and
Party D, and the potential for lack of interest among other potential acquirors depending on the outcomes of pending
clinical trials. The Board of Directors also received information from Arena senior management regarding the Omicron
variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 that had been reported to the World Health Organization and
discussed the potential risks Arena may face in light of the new variant, including potential impacts on its ability to
conduct clinical trials on the timelines then contemplated. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors directed
Mr. Munshi to contact Dr. Bourla to indicate that Arena would continue to negotiate the terms of the Merger
Agreement and allow Pfizer to progress its due diligence without expressing a view on price at that time. The Board of
Directors further directed the Arena senior management team and Arena’s legal and financial advisors to engage in
discussions with Pfizer and its legal and financial advisors to determine whether there would be terms on which Pfizer
would be willing to transact with Arena that would be acceptable to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
indicated that certainty of closing, including appropriate carveouts to the definition of Company Material Adverse
Effect relating to clinical trials, appropriate regulatory efforts obligations, an appropriate reverse termination fee and
termination fee, an outside date not substantially longer than one year and the ability to adequately operate Arena’s
business between signing and closing of a transaction would be essential factors in the Board’s consideration of any
transaction.
On November 28, 2021, Mr. Aurentz spoke with Mr. Shay Tamari, Business Development Group Lead, Inflammation &
Immunology at Pfizer. Messrs. Aurentz and Tamari agreed to connect representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim
Securities with representatives of BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”) and Centerview Partners LLC
(“Centerview”), financial advisors to Pfizer, to facilitate further discussion of certain key transaction terms, including
the outside date, termination fee, reverse termination fee, regulatory efforts covenants and closing conditions relating
to regulatory approvals. Mr. Aurentz and Mr. Tamari also agreed to progress in parallel the negotiation of other terms
of the Merger Agreement and completion of Pfizer’s due diligence.
Later that day, Ropes & Gray sent Cooley a draft Merger Agreement, which was substantially similar to the draft
Ropes & Gray shared on November 17, 2021, except that the draft included a reverse termination fee equal to the then
unspecified termination fee payable by Pfizer to Arena. The draft Merger Agreement also included carveouts to the
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect for adverse events or outcomes relating to the ELEVATE UC-12 and
ELEVATE UC-52 trials.
On November 30, 2021, representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities held a meeting with BofA Securities
and Centerview to convey the proposal on certain key terms of the Merger Agreement developed by Arena senior
management and its legal and financial advisors based on the guidance provided by the Board at the November 27
meeting. Representatives of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities proposed (i) an initial outside date of March 15,
2022 that could be extended to December 15, 2022 by either party, (ii) that on March 15, 2022, either party could
terminate the Merger Agreement and Arena would receive a $350 million reverse termination fee from Pfizer in certain
circumstances relating to the failure of certain regulatory approvals to be obtained, (iii) that if either party extended
the proposed outside date, then Pfizer would advance $750 million to Arena as a loan at the time of the extension and
if the Merger Agreement was subsequently terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of certain
regulatory approvals to be obtained, then the $750 million loan was to be forgiven and (iv) stronger regulatory efforts
covenants and closing conditions relating to regulatory approvals.
Later that day, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of Cooley,
Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Munshi provided an update on the transaction process. Representatives of
the legal and financial advisors summarized the terms proposed during the discussion between both parties’ financial
advisors earlier that day, including considerations relating to the proposed outside date, reverse termination fee, loan
and regulatory efforts covenants.
During the period from November 30, 2021 through December 2, 2021, representatives of Arena senior management
and Pfizer management and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to engage in discussions
regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, the amounts of the termination fee and reverse termination fee and the
circumstances in which they would be payable, Pfizer’s regulatory efforts obligations and regulatory closing
conditions, Arena’s ability to pursue financing between signing and closing and the exceptions to the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities
gave an update on the transaction process, including a summary of their discussions over the prior few days with
BofA Securities and Centerview. Representatives of Cooley summarized their discussions over the same period with
Ropes & Gray. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities then presented an updated
financial analysis of the potential transaction with Pfizer. Following the presentations from each of Evercore and
Guggenheim Securities, the Board of Directors met in an executive session and discussed views regarding price and
other transaction terms. At the conclusion of the meeting, based on the further discussion by the Board of Directors
of certain factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors, including the inherent uncertainties in remaining a
standalone company, the potential outcomes of clinical trials, the resulting ability to access capital depending on
those outcomes and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and the potential risks Arena may
face in light of the new variant, the Board of Directors directed Mr. Munshi to continue to negotiate with Pfizer, with
the assistance of Arena’s legal and financial advisors.
Later that day, Cooley sent Ropes & Gray a revised draft Merger Agreement and an initial draft of the disclosure
schedules. From December 2, 2021 to immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement on December 12, 2021, the
parties and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement,
including, among other things, the amounts of the termination fee and reverse termination fee and the circumstances
in which they would be payable, Pfizer’s regulatory efforts obligations and regulatory closing conditions, Arena’s
ability to obtain financing between signing and closing and the exceptions to the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect, in all cases based on the views of the Board of Directors discussed with Arena senior management
and Arena’s legal and financial advisors. During this period, Cooley and Ropes & Gray also exchanged multiple
revised drafts of the Merger Agreement.
On December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Arena senior management gave an update on the transaction process
and an update regarding the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, including a summary of the terms of the draft
Merger Agreement and material open items based on negotiations to date. The Board of Directors discussed the draft
Merger Agreement and directed Arena senior management, specifically Mr. Aurentz, to negotiate certain terms,
including price and matters relating to the reverse termination fee, Pfizer’s regulatory efforts obligations, the scope of
the exceptions to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect relating to clinical trials and the termination fee
in accordance with the views expressed by the Board of Directors.
On December 9, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities to further discuss the terms of the draft Merger Agreement based on
negotiations to date and the overall status of discussions with Pfizer.
Also on December 9, 2021, Mr. Aurentz spoke with Ms. Baron to convey Arena’s proposal regarding certain terms of
the draft Merger Agreement as directed by the Board of Directors on December 7th. In addition, Mr. Aurentz
provided a written summary of Arena’s proposal with respect to key terms to Ms. Baron. As part of this proposal, Mr.
Aurentz indicated that Pfizer should propose an increase to $105.00 per share, the price included in the November 8
Proposal for consideration by the Board of Directors.
On December 10, 2021, Ms. Baron contacted Mr. Aurentz to convey Pfizer’s position regarding certain key terms of
the Merger Agreement, including Pfizer's proposal of $100.00 per share. Later that day, Ms. Baron contacted Mr.
Aurentz again to confirm to Arena that $100.00 per share was Pfizer’s best and final proposal (which we refer to as the
“December 10 Proposal”).
On December 11, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. Messrs. Munshi and Aurentz summarized the discussions with Pfizer
over the past two days, including the December 10 Proposal, which represented Pfizer’s best and final proposal.
Representatives from Cooley summarized the fiduciary duties applicable to the Board of Directors in the context of
the proposed transaction. Representatives from Cooley then summarized the latest draft of the Merger Agreement,
which had been sent to Cooley by Ropes & Gray earlier that day to reflect the conversations the prior day between
Mr. Aurentz and Ms. Baron, including the provisions relating to the reverse termination fee, Pfizer’s regulatory efforts
obligations, exceptions to the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect relating to

clinical trials and the termination fee. Representatives from each of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities presented
their financial analysis of the potential transaction with Pfizer. Following this discussion, the Board of Directors
directed Arena senior management and the legal and financial advisors to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement
for consideration by the Board of Directors.
Throughout the remainder of December 11 and December 12, 2021, Cooley and Ropes & Gray worked to finalize the
Merger Agreement and related documents.
On December 12, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting with Arena senior management and representatives of
Cooley, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. At this meeting, Evercore reviewed with the Board of Directors its
financial analysis of the Merger Consideration and delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received
by the holders of shares of common stock of Arena in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. Also at this meeting of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities reviewed its financial analysis of the
Merger Consideration and rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing), to the Board of
Directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications
and conditions described in Guggenheim Securities’ opinion, the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of common stock of Arena. For more information about the
opinions of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities, see below under the captions “The Merger-Opinion of Evercore
Group L.L.C.” and “The Merger-Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC”.
Following the delivery of the opinions of Evercore and Guggenheim Securities, representatives of Cooley reviewed
with the Board of Directors material terms of the proposed final Merger Agreement. For more information concerning
the terms of the Merger Agreement, see the section titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement.”
Representatives of Cooley answered questions from members of the Board of Directors regarding the terms of the
Merger Agreement and the potential risks associated with the completion of the Merger based on the terms of the
Merger Agreement. After the presentation by Cooley, the Board of Directors continued to discuss the potential
transaction with Pfizer, Arena’s various alternatives (including whether to continue to operate the business on a
standalone basis) and the reasons that the Board of Directors determined that the proposed Merger with Pfizer,
Merger Agreement and other transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and in the best interests of Arena
and its stockholders. For more information concerning the factors that the Board of Directors considered, see the
section titled “The Merger-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.” Following that
discussion, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders, and
authorized and directed Arena senior management to execute the final Merger Agreement and related definitive
documents with Pfizer.
Later that day, Arena and Pfizer executed the Merger Agreement.
On December 13, 2021, prior to the opening of trading on the U.S. stock markets, Arena and Pfizer issued a joint press
release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.",31,39

are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Arena and the stockholders; (ii) approved and declared it advisable
to enter into the Merger Agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote
of the stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,

(iii) “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
30TABLE OF CONTENTS
Reasons for the Merger
In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with Arena
management, Cooley and its financial advisors, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities. The Board of Directors
considered the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as
generally supporting its (i) determination that the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders; (ii) approval of and declaration that it is advisable to
enter into the Merger Agreement; (iii) direction that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of
Arena’s stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
resolution to recommend that Arena’s stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein:
•
Compelling Premium: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $100.00 per share represented a compelling
premium to historical market prices for the shares of Arena common stock, including that the Merger
Consideration constituted a premium of:
○
approximately 100% to the closing price of common stock of $49.94 per share on December 10, 2021,
the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger;
○
approximately 76% to the 30-day trading period volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of common
stock;
○
approximately 71% to the 60-day trading period VWAP of common stock;
○
approximately 77% to the 90-day trading period VWAP of common stock; and
○
approximately 66% to the 180-day trading period VWAP of common stock;
•
Attractive Certainty of Value: in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the all-cash consideration of
$100.00 per share of common stock, taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and
short and long term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of Arena, and the relative
certainty and liquidity of the all-cash consideration, is more favorable to Arena’s stockholders than the
risk-adjusted value expected from the alternative of Arena continuing to operate independently and
pursuing its current business and financial plans on a standalone basis, taking into account near-term and
longer term uncertainties associated with continued independence;

The Board of Directors assessed Arena’s prospects for substantially increasing stockholder value as a standalone
company in excess of the Merger Consideration, given the risks and uncertainties in Arena’s business, including:
•
the fact that Arena’s lead product development candidate, etrasimod, has not yet been approved for
marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by any similar non-U.S. regulatory body, as well as
the status and prospects for Arena’s current pipeline of other drug candidates, and the risks inherent in the
research, development, regulatory review and potential future commercialization of these drug candidates;
•
the possible failure or delays of current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials;
•
the reliance on third parties or partners, to conduct clinical trials and the risks and costs of hiring additional
personnel as Arena’s pre-commercial and clinical activities increase;
•
the uncertainty of the outcomes of ongoing and planned clinical trials and the potential to not obtain
regulatory approval, including the potential identification of safety-related concerns associated with the
use of a drug candidate;
•
the significant risks and challenges associated with commercializing etrasimod, including product
development and pre-commercial operations, the costs associated with successfully scaling commercial
operations globally and the risk that Arena is unable to generate adequate product revenue or achieve
profitability;
•
the outcome, timing and costs of bringing etrasimod to market and risks if Arena is unable to maximize its
potential across a range of immunology and inflammation indications;
•
the risks and costs of developing a commercial infrastructure in anticipation of obtaining marketing
approval;
•
the risks inherent in obtaining regulatory approvals from regulatory authorities and adequate
reimbursement from regulatory authorities and other third party payors to be able to sell etrasimod and
Arena’s other product candidates;
•
risks and potential delays relating to the manufacturing and supply of Arena’s drug candidates and future
drug candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for commercialization, the risk of reliance on suppliers,
including due to the failure to comply with manufacturing regulations;
•
risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants (including the omicron
variant), and the potential impact of such risks and uncertainties on a standalone strategy and the trading
price of common stock, including the uncertainty related to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
potential consequences of the pandemic on the financial markets and Arena’s current and future business
and operations, which could include delays of Arena’s ongoing and planned clinical trials; decreases and
delays in supplier, vendor and collaboration partner interactions as a result of government and other
restrictions; delays in interactions with and responses from governmental authorities; and disruptions in
the operations of clinical research organizations and other third parties upon whom Arena relies;

•
the current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the
biopharmaceutical financial markets, increased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade
tensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the biopharmaceutical
industry and the future commercialization efforts required if any of Arena’s product candidates are
approved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties associated with research,
development and commercialization of Arena’s pipeline programs, all of which risks are enhanced by the
COVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Arena’s stockholders who do not vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures under
Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court
determine the fair value of their shares, which may be determined by the court to be more than, less than, or
the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement; and
•
the likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be
completed.
The Board of Directors also took into consideration that as a standalone company Arena would need to seek
additional funding through future equity, royalty and/or debt financings or additional collaborations or strategic
partnerships, and any such fundraising could have a highly dilutive effect on Arena’s existing stockholders, could
require Arena to enter into restrictive covenants, might only be available on unfavorable terms given the recent
downward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets, or might not be available at all.
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the
following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
•
the fact that Arena would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and stockholders
would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential
future appreciation in value of Arena;
•
the risks and costs to Arena if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner, including
the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on its ongoing clinical trials
and preparation for potential regulatory approval and commercialization;
•
the requirement that Arena pay Pfizer the Arena Termination Fee under certain circumstances following
termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger Agreement
in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (for more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-The Board of
Directors’ Recommendation; Arena Adverse Recommendation Change”);
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Arena’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the
requirement that Arena conduct in all material respects its business in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Arena from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the
Merger Agreement, Arena might have pursued;
•
the fact that an all-cash transaction would generally be taxable to Arena’s stockholders that are U.S.
persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit Arena and its representatives from soliciting third
party acquisition proposals until the earlier of the filing of the certificate of merger or the termination of the
Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time
and effort of Arena management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business
operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of
termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Arena’s common stock;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger will require certain antitrust clearance and consents, which
clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks;

the fact that Arena’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, those of Arena’s stockholders (For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Interests of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”); and
•
the possible loss of key management or other personnel of Arena during the pendency of the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby addresses the reasons considered by the Board of Directors in
consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the Board of Directors in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not find
it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and reasons described above,
individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process
and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors based its unanimous
recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth
above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Financial Projections
The Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Arena senior
management. KPMG LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with
respect to the accompanying Projections and, accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form
of assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG LLP report incorporated by reference relates to Arena’s previously
issued historical financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.
The Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Arena senior management with respect to general
business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of
which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Arena’s control. In particular, the Projections, while
presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater
uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an
effect on Arena’s business and its results of operations. The Projections were developed solely using the information
available to Arena senior management at the time they were created and reflects assumptions as to certain business
decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may result in the
Projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to, the ability to generate revenue for each of etrasimod
indications, ralinepag and other Arena pipeline assets, the effect of regulatory actions, the decisions of third-party
partners, the ability to out-license products, success of clinical testing, the effect of global economic conditions,
including COVID-19, and increases in regulatory oversight and other risk factors described in Arena’s annual report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to
change. Modeling and forecasting the future in the biopharmaceutical industry, in particular, is a highly speculative
endeavor.
None of Arena, Pfizer or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any representation
to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the
ultimate performance of Arena relative to the Projections. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement
does not constitute an admission or representation of Arena that the Projections or the information contained therein
is material. Except as required by applicable law, neither Arena nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each of them
disclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or
change or otherwise have become, are or become inappropriate (even in the short term). These considerations should
be taken into account if evaluating the Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding Arena in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Arena senior
management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Merger or any changes to
Arena’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs
incurred in connection with the proposed Merger. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of
any failure of the proposed Merger to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that
context.
The Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the
Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Arena or anyone who received the Projections then
considered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this
information should not be relied upon as such. Arena senior management views the Projections as being subject to
inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.
EBIT and unlevered free cash flow contained in the Projections set forth below are each “non-GAAP financial
measures,” which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-
GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different
from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-
GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP
presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an
alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The information and table set forth below is included solely to give Arena stockholders access to certain of the
financial projections that were made available to the Board of Directors, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities and is
not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder’s decision to vote with respect to the
adoption of the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose:

Unlevered free cash flow calculated as EBIT less (i) taxes, less (ii) net working capital, less (iii) capital expenditures, plus (iv)
depreciation and amortization. Unlevered free cash flow reflects a long-term tax rate of 25% and utilization of Arena’s estimated
net operating losses of $1,541 million as of December 31, 2021. In calculating unlevered free cash flow, Evercore did not offset
Arena’s taxes by net operating losses, resulting in a decrease to unlevered free cash flow of $90 million in 2027, $153 million in
2028, $246 million in 2029, $373 million in 2030 and $257 million in 2031. Evercore separately calculated the present value of
the tax savings from Arena’s estimated usage of net operating losses and included the result in its determination of estimated
implied equity values as discussed in the section entitled. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger-Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.”.
Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
Arena retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. As part of this engagement,
Arena requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of common stock. At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 12, 2021,
Evercore rendered to the Board of Directors its opinion to the effect that, as of December 12, 2021 and based upon
and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated as of December 12, 2021, which sets forth, among other
things, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated herein by reference. Arena encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Board of Directors (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any
holder of common stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Arena, nor
does it address the underlying business decision of Arena to engage in the Merger. 
In connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Arena that Evercore
deemed to be relevant;
(ii)
reviewed the Projections relating to Arena prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of Arena, as
approved for Evercore’s use by Arena;
(iii) discussed with management of Arena their assessment of the past and current operations of Arena, the
current financial condition and prospects of Arena, and the Projections;
(iv) reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the common stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of Arena and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain
other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant;
(vi) compared the financial performance of Arena and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed relevant;
(vii) reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and has not
assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and further relied upon the
assurances of the management of Arena that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, Evercore assumed with Arena’s consent that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of Arena as to the future financial performance of Arena and the other matters covered
thereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore
further assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals
or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or
condition that would have an adverse effect on Arena or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the
contemplated benefits of the Merger to the holders of the common stock.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Arena and did not make or assume
any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Arena, nor was Evercore furnished with any
such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of Arena under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion is necessarily based upon
information made available to it as of December 12, 2021 and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed and as could be evaluated as of that date. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect
Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to
the holders of the common stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. Evercore did not
express any view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Arena, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to
any of the officers, directors or employees of Arena, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not been asked to, nor did it express any view on, and Evercore’s opinion
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the
structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Evercore’s opinion does
not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be
available to Arena, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Arena to engage in the Merger.
Evercore’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in
respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the common stock should act or vote in respect of
the Merger. Evercore did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of common stock will trade at any
time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Arena or the Merger or as to
the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Arena or the ability of Arena to pay its obligations when
they come due. Evercore is not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and has assumed the accuracy and
completeness of assessments by Arena and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Board of Directors on
December 12, 2021 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be
a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of
these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data that existed on or before December 10, 2021 (the last trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore’s
opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its
opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Arena. The estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and
reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies,
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses
and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order
to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables
are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses.
Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of such analyses. 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Arena to calculate the estimated present value of the
standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows, defined as net operating profit after tax, plus depreciation and
amortization, plus share-based compensation, less increases in net working capital and capital expenditures, that
Arena was forecasted to generate during Arena’s fiscal years 2022 through 2040 based on the Projections provided
by Arena senior management. Evercore calculated terminal values for Arena by applying perpetuity growth rates of
negative 60.0% to negative 80.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and
experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Arena was forecasted to
generate based on Projections. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 using
discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Arena’s weighted average cost of
capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting convention, which range was selected based on Evercore’s
professional judgment and experience. In calculating Arena’s implied enterprise value, Evercore included the upfront
payment made to Aristea on July 27, 2021. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Arena’s net debt
(calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 10, 2021, certain minority interests, the cost
of projected future capital raises, the present value of tax savings from Arena’s estimated usage of net operating
losses based on the Projections and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each case as provided by
Arena senior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of
$82.95 to $101.00, compared to the Merger Consideration.

Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions
involving publicly-traded target companies in the biopharmaceutical industry announced since 2015 (the “Selected
Transactions”). The Selected Transactions reviewed by Evercore, and the month and year each was announced, are
set forth in the table below. For each Selected Transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined
as the target company’s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total
debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of each target’s T+5
revenue (meaning revenue during the fifth year after the transaction was announced, based on broker consensus
estimates as of the applicable unaffected date of each respective transaction, (“T+5 Revenue”)) as of the
announcement of the applicable transaction.

Based on the multiples it derived from the Selected Transactions and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Evercore selected a reference range of enterprise value to T+5 Revenue Multiples of 4.0x to 7.0x and
applied this range of multiples to Arena’s estimated 2026 revenue based on the Projections. Based on this range of
implied enterprise values and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each case as provided by Arena
senior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of $69.75 to
$109.80, compared to the Merger Consideration.
Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the Selected Transactions analysis is directly
comparable to Arena and none of the Selected Transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected
these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and
experience, considered generally relevant to Arena for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected
Transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market
conditions and other factors existing at the time of the Selected Transactions, and other matters, as well as
differences in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or
businesses in the Selected Transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could
affect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions and the multiples
derived from the Selected Transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in
itself a meaningful method of using the data of the Selected Transactions.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to
its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of common stock during the twelve (12) month period ended
December 10, 2021, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $45.50 (on August 19,
2021) to $85.00 (February 16, 2021) per share of common stock, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of common stock prepared and
published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of December 10, 2021, the last full trading day
prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Board of Directors. These price targets reflect analysts’
estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of common stock at the time the price target was
published. As of December 10, 2021, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per share of common
stock was $71.00 to $120.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not
necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of common stock and these target prices and the
analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors
affecting the financial performance of Arena and future general industry and market conditions.
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of Arena to corresponding financial multiples and
ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry (the “Selected
Companies”):
•
Biohaven Pharmaceuticals Holding Company Ltd.
•
Kodiak Sciences Inc.
•
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
•
Allakos Inc.
•
Chemocentryx, Inc.
•
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
•
Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.
•
Reata Pharmaceuticals Inc.
•
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.
For each of the Selected Companies, Evercore calculated enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus
total debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of estimated
revenue multiples in 2024, 2025 and 2026, based on closing share prices as of December 10, 2021. Estimated financial
data of the Selected Companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates.
This analysis indicated the following:

Based on the multiples it derived for the Selected Companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,
Evercore applied a forward multiple reference range of 2.0x - 4.0x to Arena’s estimated 2026 revenue based on the
Projections. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, Arena’s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt less
cash and cash equivalents) as of December 10, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of common stock, in each
case as provided by Arena senior management, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of
common stock of $42.30 to $69.75, compared to the Merger Consideration.
Although none of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to Arena, Evercore selected these companies
because they are publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and
experience, considered generally relevant to Arena for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected
Companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market
conditions affecting the Selected Companies and other matters, as well as differences in the Selected Companies’
financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors

that could affect the relative values of the Selected Companies and the multiples derived from the Selected
Companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of
using the data of the Selected Companies.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed ten transactions and announced all-cash bids for control of
U.S. public biopharmaceutical targets with an aggregate transaction value between $5 billion and $10 billion
announced since 2015. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage
by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded (a) the closing
market share prices of the target companies one day, and (b) the volume weighted average price thirty (30) and sixty
(60) days, in each case prior to the announcement of each transaction.

Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range
of 45% to 80% to the closing price per share of common stock of $49.94 as of December 10, 2021. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of common stock of $72.40 to $89.90, compared to the Merger
Consideration.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Board of Directors. In connection with the review of the Merger by the
Board of Directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s
opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw,
in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its
opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and
experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses
and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual
value of the shares of common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the
total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Board of Directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of common stock. These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities
actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly,
estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty,
and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such
estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of
Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Board of Directors or Arena senior
management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
Merger for the holders of common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with Arena, Arena has agreed to pay Evercore a fee for its
services in the amount of approximately $36.6 million, of which $2 million was paid upon delivery of Evercore’s
opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company
has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out
of its engagement.
During the two (2) year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to Arena, and Evercore has not received any compensation from Arena
during such period. In addition, during the two (2) year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its
affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Pfizer, and Evercore has not
received any compensation from Pfizer during such period. Evercore may provide financial advisory or other services
to Arena and Pfizer in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of
customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,
placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise,
Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them
may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or
otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior
loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to Arena or its affiliates, Pfizer, potential
parties to a transaction and their respective affiliates or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of
Arena.
Arena engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications, experience and reputation.
Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions to its
clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.

Overview
The Board of Directors retained Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor, including in connection with Arena’s
possible Merger with Pfizer. Guggenheim Securities has had a long-standing investment banking relationship with
Arena and has been formally engaged since November 2021 as Arena’s financial advisor. In selecting Guggenheim
Securities as its financial advisor, the Board of Directors considered that, among other things, Guggenheim Securities
is an internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm whose senior professionals
have substantial experience advising companies in, among other industries, the biopharmaceutical sector.
Guggenheim Securities, as part of its investment banking, financial advisory and capital markets businesses, is
regularly engaged in the valuation and financial assessment of businesses and securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, recapitalizations, spin-offs/split-offs, restructurings, securities offerings in both the private and
public capital markets and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
At the December 12, 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities rendered an oral opinion, which
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of December 12, 2021
and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various
limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
common stock in connection with the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
With respect to the information used in arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities noted that:
•
Guggenheim Securities relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all
industry, business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information provided by
or discussed with Arena (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided Information) or obtained from
public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.
•
Guggenheim Securities (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy,
completeness, reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim Securities did
not independently verify, any such information (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided
Information), (ii) expressed no view or opinion regarding the (a) reasonableness or achievability of the
Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which
any of the foregoing are based or (b) reasonableness of the probability adjustments reflected in the
Projections and (iii) relied upon the assurances of Arena’s senior management that they were unaware of
any facts or circumstances that would make the Arena-Provided Information incomplete, inaccurate or
misleading.
•
Specifically, with respect to (i) the Projections utilized in Guggenheim Securities’ analyses, (a) Guggenheim
Securities was advised by Arena’s senior management, and Guggenheim Securities assumed, that the
Projections (including the probability adjustments reflected therein and the expected development and
commercialization of Arena’s products and product candidates), had been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of Arena’s senior management as to
the expected future performance of Arena on a stand-alone basis and (b) Guggenheim Securities assumed
that the Projections had been reviewed by the Board of Directors with the understanding that such
information would be used and relied upon by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its
opinion and (ii) any financial projections/forecasts, other estimates and/or other forward-looking
information obtained by Guggenheim Securities from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties,
Guggenheim Securities assumed that such information was reasonable and reliable.
Guggenheim Securities also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of
its opinion:
•
During the course of its engagement, Guggenheim Securities was asked by the Board of Directors to solicit
indications of interest from various potential strategic acquirors regarding a potential extraordinary
corporate transaction with or involving Arena, and Guggenheim Securities considered the results of such
solicitation process in rendering its opinion.
•
Guggenheim Securities did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Arena or any other
entity or the solvency or fair value of Arena or any other entity, nor was Guggenheim Securities furnished
with any such appraisals.
•
Guggenheim Securities’ professionals are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or
actuarial experts and nothing in Guggenheim Securities’ opinion should be construed as constituting
advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, Guggenheim Securities relied on the assessments of
Arena’s senior management and Arena’s other professional advisors with respect to such matters.
Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or render any opinion regarding the tax consequences of
the Merger to Arena or its securityholders.
•
Guggenheim Securities further assumed that:
•
In all respects meaningful to its analyses, (i) Arena and Pfizer will comply with all terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement and (ii) the representations and warranties of Arena and Pfizer contained in the
Merger Agreement were true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each party to the Merger
Agreement to consummate the Merger would be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification
thereof; and
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
The Merger will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
and in compliance with all applicable legal and other requirements, without any delays, limitations,
restrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that
would have an effect on Arena or the Merger in any way meaningful to Guggenheim Securities’ analyses
and opinion.
•
Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the
common stock or other securities or financial instruments of or relating to Arena may trade or otherwise be
transferable at any time, including subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the Merger.
Summary of Financial Analyses
Overview of Financial Analyses
This “Summary of Financial Analyses” presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by
Guggenheim Securities and presented to the Board of Directors in connection with Guggenheim Securities’ rendering
of its opinion. Such presentation to the Board of Directors was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities’ oral
discussion with the Board of Directors, the nature and substance of which may not be fully described herein.
Some of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format.
In order to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full
text of the summary. Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances involved. A fairness opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description, and taking portions of the financial analyses set forth below, without considering such analyses as a
whole, would in Guggenheim Securities’ view create an incomplete and misleading picture of the processes
underlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities’ opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:
•
based its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general economic,
business and capital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which
are beyond the control of Arena, Pfizer and Guggenheim Securities;
•
did not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative,
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion;
•
considered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one
analysis or factor; and
•
ultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and
believes that the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by
Guggenheim Securities in connection with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the extent
expressly specified in such opinion.
With respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:
•
Such financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses.
•
None of the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions used in the selected precedent merger
and acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or directly comparable to the Merger;
however, such transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities, among other reasons, because they
involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for purposes of Guggenheim
Securities’ financial analyses, to Arena based on Guggenheim Securities’ professional judgment and
experience with the biopharmaceutical sector.
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
In any event, selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis is not purely mathematical;
rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in
business, operating, financial and capital markets-related characteristics and other factors regarding the
selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the Merger was compared.
•
Such financial analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which any securities may
trade at the present time or at any time in the future.

Arena Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Guggenheim Securities performed a stand-alone financing-adjusted
discounted cash flow analysis of Arena based on projected, risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows for
Arena and an estimate of its terminal/continuing value at the end of the projection period.
In performing its discounted cash flow analyses with respect to Arena:
•
Guggenheim Securities based its financing-adjusted discounted cash flow analysis of Arena on the
Projections.
•
Guggenheim Securities used a discount rate range of 8.00% - 9.75% based on its estimate of Arena’s
weighted average cost of capital.
•
In estimating Arena’s terminal/continuing value, Guggenheim Securities used a perpetual growth rate of
negative 70% (as provided and approved for Guggenheim Securities’ use by Arena’s senior management)
applied to Arena’s terminal year normalized after-tax unlevered free cash flow.
Guggenheim Securities’ financing-adjusted discounted cash flow analyses resulted in an overall reference range of
$86.00 - $107.00 per share (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for purposes of evaluating the equity value per share of the
common stock on a stand-alone intrinsic-value basis.
Arena Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and
analyzed certain financial metrics associated with selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions involving
companies in the biopharmaceutical sector that Guggenheim Securities deemed relevant in its professional judgment
for purposes of this analysis. Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things and to the extent publicly
available, certain implied change-of-control transaction multiples for the selected precedent merger and acquisition
transactions (based on each company’s most recent publicly available financial filings and certain other publicly
available information), which are summarized in the table below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In performing its selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis with respect to Arena, Guggenheim
Securities selected a reference range of T+5 Revenue Multiples of 5.3x to 8.1x (based on the 25th and 75th percentile
range) for purposes of evaluating the Company on a change-of-control basis.
Guggenheim Securities’ selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis resulted in an overall
reference range of $86.00 - $123.00 per share (rounded to the closest $1.00) for purposes of evaluating the common
stock on a change of control basis.
Other Financial Reviews and Analyses Solely for Informational Reference Purposes
In order to provide certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above,
Guggenheim Securities undertook various additional financial reviews and analyses as summarized below solely for
informational reference purposes. As a general matter, Guggenheim Securities did not consider such additional
financial reviews and analyses to be determinative methodologies for purposes of its opinion.
Arena Stock Price Trading History. Guggenheim Securities reviewed the common stock price trading history for the
52 weeks ending December 10, 2021, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger. The common stock
traded in a range of $45.50 (on August 19, 2021) - $85.00 (on February 16, 2021) per share.
Arena Wall Street Equity Research Analyst Stock Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street
equity research analyst stock price targets for Arena as published prior to December 10, 2021. Guggenheim Securities
noted that such Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for common stock were $71.00 - $120.00 per
share.
Premia Paid in Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions. Guggenheim Securities reviewed, based
on publicly available information, the implied premia paid or proposed to be paid in connection with selected
precedent merger and acquisition transactions. Guggenheim Securities noted that such precedent M&A transaction-
related premia ranged from (i) 49% -67% for transactions with enterprise values between $5-$15 billion and (ii) 57% -
110% for transactions with enterprise values between $2-$20 billion (each based on the 25th to 75th percentile range),
based on the target company’s unaffected spot closing stock price. Guggenheim Securities further noted that, in
connection with the Merger, the Merger-implied premium (based on the Merger Consideration) was 100% versus
Arena’s spot closing stock price of $49.94 on December 10, 2021 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of
the Merger).
Other Considerations
Except as described in the summary above, Arena did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations on,
Guggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in performing its
financial analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger were
determined through negotiations between Arena and Pfizer and were approved by the Board of Directors. The
decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. Guggenheim Securities’
opinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors. Consequently,
Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the view of the Board of
Directors with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by
the holders of common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities’ engagement letter, Arena has agreed to pay Guggenheim Securities a
cash transaction fee (based on a percentage of the aggregate value associated with the Merger) upon consummation
of the Merger, which cash transaction fee currently is estimated to be $36.6 million. Arena has previously paid
Guggenheim Securities a cash milestone fee of $2 million that became payable upon the rendering of Guggenheim
Securities’ opinion with respect to the Merger, which will be credited against the foregoing cash transaction fee. In
addition, Arena has agreed to reimburse Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and indemnify Guggenheim
Securities against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
In the two (2) years prior to the date of its written opinion, Guggenheim Securities has been engaged by Arena in
connection with various matters unrelated to the Merger, none of which resulted in a closed transaction or receipt by
Guggenheim Securities of any compensation. At the request of the Board of Directors, Guggenheim Securities
provided information about its relationships with Pfizer over the last five (5) years. During the five-year period prior
to the date of its written opinion, Guggenheim Securities has been engaged by Pfizer with respect to various matters
unrelated to the Merger, including the following, in respect of which Guggenheim Securities received compensation:
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Pfizer’s (i) carve-out of its Upjohn unit and the merger of Upjohn with Mylan N.V., (ii) divestiture of its Magnesia
Bisurada subsidiary in Brazil, (iii) joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline, (iv) acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc. and (v)
sale of its Hospira Infusion Systems business. Guggenheim Securities received compensation of approximately $110
million to $115 million in the aggregate from Pfizer during this five (5)-year period.
Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for
its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth
management; insurance services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring;
merchant banking; fixed income and equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and
futures. In the ordinary course of these activities, Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may (i)
provide such financial services to Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates, for
which services Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities may have received, and may in the future
receive, compensation and (ii) directly and indirectly hold long and short positions, trade and otherwise conduct
such activities in or with respect to loans, debt and equity securities and derivative products of or relating to Arena,
Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates. Furthermore, Guggenheim Securities and its
affiliates and related entities and its or their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may
have investments in Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and
procedures to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result,
Guggenheim Securities’ research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and
publish research reports with respect to Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates
and the Merger that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities’ investment banking personnel.
Interests of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that they existed
at the time, in reaching the determination that the terms and conditions of the Merger and the Merger Agreement
were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Arena and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “- Interests
of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Arrangements with Pfizer
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Pfizer or
any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving
Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to and following the Closing, however, certain of our executive
officers may have discussions, and following the Closing, may enter into agreements with, Pfizer or Merger Sub, their
subsidiaries or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the
equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Under the Merger Agreement, any rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the directors or
officers of Arena and its subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Parties” and, each, an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in
their respective organizational documents or indemnification agreements, in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, will (i) survive the Merger, (ii) continue
in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, and (iii) not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who
at any time on or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Arena and its subsidiaries with respect to
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification is required by law. If any
claim is asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within such six (6) year period, all rights to
indemnification with respect to any such claim or claims will continue until disposition of all such claims.
Additionally, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether
asserted
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
Arena or any of its subsidiaries and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Arena, in each case as in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Pfizer and the
Surviving Corporation (the “Indemnifying Parties) will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as an officer or director against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any
legal proceeding based on or arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of
Arena and its subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition,
from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties will, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with
eligible matters within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for such
advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Parties of appropriate undertakings in favor of the
Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under the Merger Agreement.
Arena may (i) maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
current policies of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Arena (the “Current D&O Insurance”)
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, so long as the annual premium therefor
would not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time
(such three hundred percent (300%), the “Maximum Premium”), or (ii) on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles
and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy, purchase (through a nationally recognized insurance broker)
a six (6) year “tail policy” for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time, for a premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, with respect to the Current D&O Insurance and maintain such endorsement in full force and
effect for its full term. However, if Arena’s or the Surviving Corporation’s existing insurance expires, is terminated or
cancelled during such six (6) year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain as
much directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized
premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.
Employee Benefits
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Employee Benefits.”
Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs
As of December 31, 2021, there were 61,564,122 shares of common stock outstanding, 8,001,252 shares of common
stock subject to outstanding Arena Options, 718,279 shares of common stock subject to outstanding Arena RSUs
and 183,434 shares of common stock subject to outstanding Arena PRSUs (assuming that the performance-based
vesting conditions associated with such Arena PRSUs are achieved at target). The Arena RSUs and Arena Options
held by Arena’s non-employee directors and the Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs held by Arena’s
executive officers immediately before the Effective Time will be treated as described below.
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, each:
(i)
Arena Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested,
will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-
share exercise price of such Arena Option, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such
Arena Option;
(ii)
Arena RSU, except as described in subclause (iii) below, subject to vesting conditions based solely on
continued employment or service to Arena or any of its subsidiaries that is unvested and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration;
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(iii) 2022 Arena RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
substituted automatically with an Adjusted RSU that is equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares subject to the 2022 Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Arena
RSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU
will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in connection with
certain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time), as described below under
“Payments Upon Termination at or Following a Change in Control.”
Our Compensation Committee has approved our annual 2022 equity grant in the form of 2022 Arena RSUs
to be granted to each of our current executive officers on January 3, 2022. Such 2022 Arena RSUs will vest
based on continued service over four (4) years, with twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares subject to the
2022 Arena RSUs vesting on February 15, 2023 and the remainder of the shares vesting quarterly over the
following three (3) years in twelve (12) substantially equal installments occurring on each of the 12
quarterly vesting dates thereafter (vesting dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15
each year). Such Arena RSUs will be substituted automatically with Adjusted RSUs with the same terms
and conditions (including vesting conditions) at the Effective Time as described in the preceding
paragraph. Each Adjusted RSU will vest in full upon a “Qualifying Termination,” which includes a
termination without “Cause” (as defined in the 2021 Incentive Plan) and a voluntary termination in
connection with a “Relocation Requirement” (generally related to certain forced relocations by Arena
following notice and an opportunity to cure) at any time on or after the Closing, in accordance with the
form of 2022 Arena RSU agreement; and
(iv) Arena PRSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration (with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with
such Arena PRSU being deemed achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective
Time or at target).
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs, and Arena PRSUs.”
Treatment of Arena ESPP
The Merger Agreement generally provides that after December 12, 2021, no new offering periods will begin under the
Arena ESPP, no Arena employee may become a new participant in the Arena ESPP and no Arena ESPP participant
may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election. Each purchase right issued pursuant to
the Arena ESPP must be fully exercised not later than the earlier of the last day of the current purchase period or five
(5) business days prior to the Effective Time, and immediately following such purchase and contingent on Closing,
the Arena ESPP will terminate. Two (2) of our executive officers currently participate in the Arena ESPP and have
accumulated payroll deductions under the Arena ESPP for the purchase period that commenced on November 22,
2021. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.”
Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control
Amended and Restated Severance Benefit Plan
In connection with approving the Merger Agreement, Arena amended its Amended and Restated Severance Benefit
Plan (the “Severance Plan”) as of December 12, 2021, that was previously most recently amended and restated
effective June 11, 2021. Each of Arena’s current executive officers participates in the Severance Plan and is party to an
eligibility notice thereunder.
Under the Severance Plan and the applicable eligibility notice, in the event that a participant’s employment is
terminated by Arena without “cause” or by the participant for “good reason” during the period commencing upon a
Change in Control (as defined in the Severance Plan and which includes the Merger) and ending twenty-four (24)
months following such Change in Control (excluding as a result of his or her death or “disability”), and subject to the
participant signing and not revoking a release of claims, the participant will receive (i) a lump sum payment
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
equal to the sum of the monthly base salary and monthly target bonus, as then in effect (ignoring any reduction that
forms the basis for “good reason,” if applicable), multiplied by eighteen (18) months (for Senior Vice Presidents), 24
months (for Executive Vice Presidents, which includes all of Arena’s executive officers) or thirty (30) months (in the
case of Mr. Munshi) (each such monthly period following termination of employment an “Applicable Severance
Period”); (ii) direct payment of COBRA continuation premiums for the participant and his or her eligible dependents,
or, in the discretion of Arena, cash payments in lieu thereof until the earlier of (a) the expiration of the Applicable
Severance Period and (b) the expiration of the participant’s eligibility for continuation coverage under COBRA; (iii)
100% acceleration of then unvested equity awards, provided that in the case of any such equity awards that vest
based on the achievement of performance criteria, such equity award will vest and be paid at the greater of target
performance in such award or actual performance of Arena; and (iv) extension of the post termination exercise period
with respect to any vested options until the later of (a) twenty-four (24) months following termination of employment
(or in the case of Mr. Munshi, thirty (30) months) and (b) the original post-termination exercise period.
For the purposes of the Severance Plan, “cause” generally means an involuntary termination of a participant’s
employment on or after the occurrence of a change in control upon the occurrence of one or more of the following
events if such event results in a demonstrably and material harmful impact on Arena’s business or reputation as
reasonably determined by the Board of Directors and such termination is effectuated within thirty (30) days of the
Board of Directors becoming aware of such events: (1) the participant’s willful and continued failure to substantially
perform his or her duties with Arena after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the participant
by the Board of Directors, (2) the participant’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any
crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (3) the participant’s willfully engaging in gross misconduct that
is a violation of a written Arena policy; or (4) the participant’s unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential
information or trade secrets of Arena or breach of any Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement
(or similar intellectual property agreement).
For the purposes of the Severance Plan, “good reason” generally means the participant’s resignation within ninety
(90) days following the expiration of any cure period (discussed below) following the occurrence of one or more of
the following during the period commencing upon a change in control and ending twenty-four (24) months following
such change in control: (i) a material reduction of the participant’s annual base salary; (ii) any material reduction in
the participant’s annual target bonus level or bonus opportunities; (iii) the participant’s authority, duties or
responsibilities are materially diminished such that they are no longer commensurate with his or her level of
experience, training and education; (iv) any significant reduction, in the aggregate, in the employee benefit programs
made available to the participant other than a reduction in such employee benefit programs affecting all employees of
Arena substantially equally; (v) the relocation without the participant’s prior written approval to a location that
would increase the participant’s one-way commute by more than thirty-five (35) miles in the participant’s one-way
commuting distance from his or her principal residence to the principal office or business location in which the
participant is required to perform services; or (vi) the failure of Arena to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any
successor to assume and agree to perform under the terms of the Severance Plan. A participant (1) will not resign for
“good reason” without first providing Arena with written notice of the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for
“good reason” within thirty (30) days of the initial existence of the grounds for “good reason” and a reasonable cure
period of thirty (30) days following the date Arena receives such notice during which such condition must not have
been cured; and (2) must terminate employment within ninety (90) days following the initial existence of the event
giving rise to good reason.
The aggregate amount of severance that would be paid to our other currently employed executive officer (Doug
Manion, M.D., FRCP (C)), in connection with a qualifying termination under the Severance Plan and second amended
and restated severance benefit plan eligibility notices is $1,569,753 and an estimated Section 4999 excise tax gross-up
payment of $2,405,102.
Second Amended and Restated Severance Plan Eligibility Notices
We entered into a second amended and restated severance benefit plan eligibility notice (the “Eligibility Notices”)
with each of our current executive officers, effective as of December 12, 2021. The Eligibility Notices provide for the
reimbursement by Arena for excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, to the extent applicable,
so that on a net after-tax basis the executive officer would be in the same position as if no such excise tax had applied
to the executive officer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
2022 Arena RSU Grants
As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena
PRSUs,” our Compensation Committee has approved our annual 2022 equity grant in the form of 2022 Arena RSUs to
be granted to each of our current executive officers on January 3, 2022. Such Arena RSUs will be substituted
automatically with Adjusted RSUs the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) at the Effective
Time. Each such Adjusted RSU will vest in full upon a upon a “Qualifying Termination”, which includes a termination
without “Cause” (as defined in the applicable award agreement) and a voluntary termination in connection with a
“Relocation Requirement” (generally related to certain forced relocations by Arena following notice and an
opportunity to cure) at any time on or after the Closing Date or for “Good Reason'' within twenty-four (24) months of
Closing under the terms of the Severance Plan, as described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control.''
Quantification of Potential Payments to Certain Arena Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to Arena’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon
Termination at or Following Change in Control” for further information regarding certain elements of this
compensation.
The table below assumes that:
•
the Closing occurs on April 15, 2022 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden
parachute compensation disclosure);
•
the number of unvested Arena equity awards held by the named executive officers is as of December 31,
2021, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and
excludes any additional grants that may occur following such date, other than the 2022 Arena RSUs
expected to be granted on January 3, 2022 to each executive officer;
•
pursuant to applicable proxy disclosure rules, the value of the equity award acceleration below is calculated
based on the number of shares covered by the applicable Arena Options, Arena RSUs (including 2022
Arena RSUs) and Arena PRSUs (assuming that the performance -based vesting conditions associated with
such Arena PRSUs are achieved at target) that are accelerating multiplied by $100.00 per share (less the
applicable exercise price per share in the case of Arena Options);
•
all Arena Options held by each named executive officer as of December 31, 2021 remain unexercised as of
the Closing;
•
the number of 2022 Arena RSUs to be granted on January 3, 2022 was determined by dividing the approved
grant date value for each 2022 Arena RSU by $90.00 (the estimated closing price of Arena common stock on
January 3, 2022);
•
the employment of each named executive officer will be terminated immediately following the Closing in a
manner entitling the named executive officer to receive the severance benefits described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”;
•
the named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus are as in effect as of the date of this
filing; and
•
no named executive officer enters into a new agreement or is otherwise legally entitled to, before the
Effective Time, additional compensation or benefits.
The amounts shown in the table below do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been
earned, or any amounts associated with equity awards that would vest pursuant to their terms, on or prior to the
Closing, or the value of payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise related to the Merger.
In addition to the assumptions described in the preceding paragraph, the amounts set forth in the table below are
based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. The
assumptions based upon which we have estimated the amounts in the table below may or may not actually occur.
Accordingly, the ultimate amounts to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may
differ from the amounts set forth below. For purposes of the footnotes to the table below, “single trigger” refers to
benefits that arise solely as a result of
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Closing, and “double trigger” refers to benefits that require two (2) conditions, which are the Closing and a
qualifying termination. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger -
Interests of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers” below for a quantification of the amounts that the named
executive officers will receive in respect of vested equity awards at the Effective Time.

The amounts listed in this column for each named executive officer represent the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to
which each of these named executive officers may become entitled under the Severance Plan, as described in more detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for
such “double-trigger” cash severance benefits, the employment of the named executive officer must terminate without “cause” or
the executive officer must resign for “good reason” (other than on account of death or disability) upon the change in control or
during the twenty-four (24) months following a “change in control” (as such terms are defined in the Severance Plan and as
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”)
(for the purposes of the table above, a “Qualifying CIC Termination”).
(2)
For each named executive officer the amount listed in this column represents, in part, the estimated value (as shown in the table
below in the “Equity Acceleration” column) of vesting acceleration to which he or she may become entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which are “single trigger” benefits) or, thereafter, under the terms of the Adjusted RSU,
as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination at or Following
Change in Control” and “-Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs” (which are “double trigger” benefits). To
be eligible for “double-trigger” benefits, the employment of the named executive officer must incur a Qualifying CIC Termination
under the Severance Plan or must terminate without “cause” or, subject to applicable notice and cure provisions, the executive
officer must resign as a result of a “relocation requirement” under the terms of the applicable Adjusted RSU. The grant date value
of the 2022 Arena RSUs for Mr. Munshi is $8,000,000 and for each of the other named executive officers is $2,000,000. The
amounts in the table below under “Double Trigger” assume that the number of Adjusted RSUs is determined by dividing these
values by $90.00 (the estimated stock price on January 3, 2022) and then multiplying it by $100.00 per share.

The amounts listed in this column represent the cost of continued health and welfare coverage to each named executive officer
who may become entitled under the Severance Plan and related eligibility notice, as described in more detail in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “-Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control”. To be eligible for such “double-
trigger” health and welfare benefits continuation payments, the employment of the executive officer must terminate in a
Qualifying CIC Termination. The full amount represents the cost of continuing health and welfare coverage for the entire
severance period starting on May 1, 2022, assumes 10% rate increases effective each of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024 and
assumes actual benefit elections made by each executive officer for the 2022 calendar year continue unchanged for the severance
period.

Based on estimates as in effect on the date hereof no named executive officer would receive a 280G excise tax gross-up payment.
Equity Awards Held by Arena’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors
As discussed above at “Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs”, at the Effective Time, each
Arena Option, Arena RSU (other than the 2022 Arena RSUs) and Arena PRSU will be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares
subject to such award, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (or, for each Arena Option, the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over such Arena Option’s per share exercise price or, for each Arena PRSU, the Merger
Consideration with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with the Arena PRSU being deemed
achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective Time or at target), subject to any required
withholding of taxes.
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effective as of the Effective Time, each 2022 Arena RSU will be substituted automatically with an Adjusted RSU equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares subject to the 2022 Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Arena RSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each
Adjusted RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in connection
with certain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time, as described above).
Each of our executive officers is eligible to receive the applicable vesting acceleration benefits with respect to his or
her equity awards described above under the heading “Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in
Control”.

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock
underlying equity awards held by each of Arena’s executive officers and non-employee directors that are
outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and includes the quantity of 2022 Arena RSUs to be granted to each current
executive officer on January 3, 2022 (which was determined by dividing the approved grant date value for each 2022
Arena RSU by $90.00, the estimated closing price of Arena common stock on January 3, 2022). The table also sets
forth the values of these shares and equity awards, determined as the number of shares multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (minus the applicable per share exercise price for any Arena Options and assuming that the
performance-based vesting conditions associated with such Arena PRSUs are achieved at target). Except for the
awards described herein, no additional shares of common stock or equity awards were granted to any executive
officer or non-employee director in contemplation of the Merger.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders of Arena (i) who continuously hold
shares of Arena common stock through the Effective Time, (ii) who did not vote their shares in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement; (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, (iv) who
otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL; and (v) who
do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to perfect or otherwise lose their appraisal
rights, in each case in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to demand appraisal of their shares
and receive, if the Merger is successful and the Merger is consummated, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, an
amount in cash equal to the “fair value” of their shares (as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any), as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should be aware that the fair
value of their shares could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment
banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction,
such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.
The following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex D. This summary
does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the
DGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder
of shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person
holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee,
must act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely
manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result
in termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that
Arena will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder.
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Any stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the
DGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that Arena
stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the
stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of the
stockholders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.
This proxy statement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the
required copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Any stockholder who
wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the
following discussion and Annex D carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures
specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the
following:
•
deliver to Arena a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Arena common stock prior to the taking of
the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, which written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity
of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. This
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or
voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting “AGAINST” or failing to vote “FOR” the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning
of Section 262 of the DGCL;
•
not vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
•
continuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made
through the Effective Time of the Merger; and
•
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including
filing of a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of your
shares of common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the
effective date of the Merger to those stockholders of Arena who have properly made a written demand for appraisal
pursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, has not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is consummated,
a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above
(or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your
appraisal rights. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any stockholder who has
demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without interest, specified by
the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the
Effective Time of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no appraisal
proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval of
the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just; provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an
appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within sixty (60)
days after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder’s request to
withdraw a demand for appraisal when the approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised
value determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the
value of the Merger Consideration.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Written Demand by the Stockholder
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204,
Park City, Utah 84060. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the
stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder’s name appears on the stockholder’s certificates
(whether in book entry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of
record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand must be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners,
may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of
such shares.
A beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions
as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If
shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any
beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible
for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the
shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record
of the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.
A record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee
for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial
owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the
written demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for
appraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such
stockholder.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their
shares in favor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that
120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their
shares. None of Pfizer, Merger Sub or Arena, as the Surviving Corporation, has any obligation to or has any present
intention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a petition or
will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the
stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the
DGCL and the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Arena has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a written request
therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for
appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been
properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request
from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after receiving service of a
copy of the petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the “Verified List”) containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the “Dissenting
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stockholders”) and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a
petition by a Dissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time
and place fixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting
Stockholders shown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication
deemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the
Surviving Corporation.
If a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting
Stockholders have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their
shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their share certificates, if
any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does
not comply with such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share
certificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect
of such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately
before the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the
appraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration
provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from
the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will
accrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment.
However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each
However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of
(i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless
paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “fair price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market
value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.” Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion that does not encompass known elements of value,”
but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.
An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration
payable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. You should be aware that the
fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than
the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List
and who has submitted such stockholder’s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights. When the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the
payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of
uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware
Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys’
fees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to
appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court
of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Stockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined
under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to
be paid in the Merger. Although Arena believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to
the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither Pfizer nor Arena
anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Pfizer and Arena
reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value”
of the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.
The process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.
Stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL
will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date
prior to the Effective Time.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully
withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, the stockholder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as Arena has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention
to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her
or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger Consideration by
delivering to Arena a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of
the Merger either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of
Arena. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that the limitation
set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Merger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.`
STOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL
NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL
RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
The foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of Arena to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does
not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of Arena desiring
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the
DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement.
Accounting Treatment
The Merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be
relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) whose shares are converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This summary is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any
applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,
published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to stockholders who
hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences that may be relevant to stockholders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as:
•
banks, mutual funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions;
•
tax-exempt organizations;
•
retirement or other tax deferred accounts;
•
S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or other pass-through entities) or an investor in a partnership,
S corporation (or other pass-through entity);
•
dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities;
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;
•
entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
•
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
except as noted below, stockholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five
percent (5%) or more of Arena’s common stock (by vote or value);
•
stockholders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk
reduction transaction;
•
stockholders whose shares constitute qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202 of
the Code;
•
stockholders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax
qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
stockholders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Pfizer or the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
stockholders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch
thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
stockholders subject to the Medicare tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax;
•
stockholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to
the shares of common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in
the Code);
•
stockholders who are controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or
corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; or
•
tax consequences to stockholders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of
their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the
consequences of the Merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views
expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX
PLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a U.S. Holder
nor an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of shares (that is,
shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the
amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the
completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are currently taxed at preferential U.S.
federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed
base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder
is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or
a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the Merger, and certain other requirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-
U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
•
Arena is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section
897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding the
Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock
(the “Relevant Period”) and, if shares of Arena’s common stock are regularly traded on an established
securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly
or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than five percent (5%) of our common stock at any
time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates
generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch
profits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not,
and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding the Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the
proceeds received by a stockholder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S.
Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such stockholder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a
certification of such stockholder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or
successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against the stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to
the IRS.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on
certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and
provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution
(which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign
entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of
thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the
withholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or
provides information regarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental
agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. FATCA
withholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed regulations
which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable
to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed
regulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final
regulations are issued.

Stockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on
the disposition of common stock pursuant to the Merger.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",64,73
ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS INC_20220103_DEFM14A_19751337_4360734.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Arena and Pfizer have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain
limitations as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
HSR Act and Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting
period under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger is thirty (30) calendar days, unless the waiting period is
terminated earlier or extended. If the DOJ or FTC issues a request for additional information and documentary
materials (which we refer to as a “Second Request”), the parties must observe a second thirty (30)-day waiting period,
which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with such Second Request, unless the
waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay consummation of the merger for
a specified period of time.
The Merger is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of Arena and
Pfizer file a notification and report form with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting
period has expired or been terminated.
The Merger is also conditioned on the expiration or termination of any agreement not to consummate the Merger with
any governmental body, and the receipt of any requisite approvals or clearances under the Antitrust Laws and
competition laws of other jurisdictions that may initiate or commence or merger control inquiry and for which
approval or clearance is deemed applicable to the Merger. This includes Austria and Germany unless the relevant
jurisdiction declines, does not assert or defers jurisdiction; the United Kingdom if it opens an investigation or
requires that a merger notification be made; and the European Union if the European Commission accepts a referral
request.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the Antitrust Laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets
or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other remedies. At any
time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take such action under the Antitrust Laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold
separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other
remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the Antitrust Laws under certain circumstances,
including by seeking to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any
of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. We cannot be
certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions, restrictions,
qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest
assets, license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other
remedies, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the
conditions to the Merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of
the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger
Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger
Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information
contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(i) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Arena, Pfizer and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of
the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the representations and
warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between
Arena, Pfizer and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-
party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Arena,
Pfizer or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In
addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective
businesses of Arena, Pfizer and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly
permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the
appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is
described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Arena, Pfizer, Merger Sub or their respective
businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement
should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our
filings with the SEC regarding Arena and its business.",75,75

At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the parties or any of Arena’s stockholders, each
share of common stock of Arena, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) then outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) common stock owned by Arena as treasury stock, (ii) common stock owned by Pfizer or
Merger Sub and (iii) any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and cease to exist and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to any withholding of taxes.
Treatment of Arena Options, Arena RSUs and Arena PRSUs
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, each:
(i)
Arena Option granted by Arena under the Arena Stock Plans that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Arena Option, multiplied by (2) the
number of shares of common stock then subject to such Arena Option;
(ii)
Arena RSU, except as described in subclause (iii) below, subject to vesting conditions based solely on
continued employment or service to Arena or its subsidiaries Plan that is unvested and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration;
(iii) 2022 Arena RSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
substituted automatically with an Adjusted RSU that is equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares of common stock subject to the 2022 Arena RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by (2) the Arena RSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share. Each
Adjusted RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such 2022 Arena
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and subject to accelerated vesting in
connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment following the Effective Time); and
(iv) Arena PRSU that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and immediately cease to be outstanding and concerted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration (with all the performance-based vesting conditions associated with
such Arena PRSU being deemed achieved at the greater of actual completed performance at the Effective
Time or at target).
Treatment of Purchase Rights Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Merger Agreement generally provides that after December 12, 2021, no new offering periods will begin under the
Arena ESPP and no Arena employee may become a new participant in the Arena ESPP and no Arena ESPP participant
may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deductions or purchase elections. Each purchase right
issued pursuant to the Arena ESPP must be fully exercised not later than the earlier of the last day of the current
purchase period or five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time and, immediately following such purchase and
contingent on closing, the Arena ESPP will terminate.

The Merger Agreement provides that the Paying Agent will act as agent for the holders of common stock and will
receive the funds to which holders of common stock will become entitled in connection with the Merger. The Paying
Agent will act as agent to the stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration payments. Pfizer will cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly after the Effective Time (and no
later than the same day as the Effective Time occurs to the extent that the Effective Time is before 1:00 p.m. New York
time, or else, the next business day) and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to
67TABLE OF CONTENTS
pay for common stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the “Exchange
Fund”). If the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of common stock are entitled, Pfizer
will promptly deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit, additional cash with the Paying Agent
sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Pfizer and the Surviving Corporation will in any event
be liable for payment thereof.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter), the Paying Agent will
mail to each holder of record of a certificate share of common stock (a “Certificate”), which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Pfizer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
properly completed and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (such payments to be net of
applicable taxes withheld) for each share of common stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation may require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any unclaimed funds, at which point holders of shares entitled to the unclaimed funds may look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their certificates or shares of common stock,

changes in the economic, business and financial environment generally affecting the biotechnology
industry;
(iii)
in and of itself, any change in Arena’s stock price or any failure by Arena to meet any revenue, earnings
or other similar internal or analysts’ projections (it being understood that any effect, change,
development or occurrence giving rise to or contributing to such change or failure may be deemed to
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Material Adverse Effect);
(iv)
an act of terrorism or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war (whether or not declared) or any
natural disasters, health emergencies, including pandemics (including COVID-19, and any evolutions or
mutations thereof or related or associated epidemics, pandemics or disease outbreaks or other outbreaks
of diseases or quarantine restrictions) or epidemics, or other similar force majeure events, including any
worsening of such conditions existing as of the date of the Merger Agreement;

warranties relating to required filings and consents);

and (v) above, have a disproportionate impact on Arena and each subsidiary of Arena, taken as a whole, relative to
the other participants in the biotechnology industry, such effects, changes, developments or occurrences may be
taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred to the extent of such
disproportionate impact or (b) on the ability of Arena to perform its obligations in accordance with the Merger
Agreement or to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated thereby.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Arena Acquisition Proposal” means an inquiry, proposal or offer (whether or not in writing) from any person (other
than Pfizer or its subsidiaries) relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to (in one transaction or a series of
transactions) any:

subsidiaries or any resulting parent company of Arena or its subsidiaries;
•
sale, lease, license or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of Arena (including capital stock or

•
issuance or sale or other disposition of capital stock or other equity interests representing twenty percent
(20%) or more (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of equity or voting securities of Arena;
•
tender offer, exchange offer or any other transaction or series of transactions that, if consummated, would
result in any person or group of related persons, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning or having the
right to acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing twenty percent
(20%) or more (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of equity or voting securities of Arena; or
•
any combination of the foregoing.
“Superior Proposal” means a written Arena Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or involve a material breach
and that proposes an acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities or consolidated total assets
of Arena and its subsidiaries on terms which the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment to be more
favorable to the holders of common stock than the transactions contemplated hereby (after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Merger
Agreement, which the Board of Directors has determined to be as or more reasonably likely to be completed on the
terms proposed than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal and the terms of the Merger Agreement.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Arena and its subsidiaries have agreed to cease, terminate and use reasonable best
efforts to cause its representatives to cease and terminate, all solicitations, discussions, and negotiations with any
person with respect to any Arena Acquisition Proposal of as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
In addition, during the Pre-Closing Period, Arena and its subsidiaries have agreed not to, and to cause its
representatives not to directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate the making of any offer or proposal which constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to an Arena Acquisition Proposal;
•
enter into any agreement with respect to an Arena Acquisition Proposal; or
•
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public information or data to, any person
(other than Pfizer or its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Arena Acquisition Proposal, grant any
waiver or release under any restriction from making an Arena Acquisition Proposal, in each case, other than
discussions solely to notify such person of the terms of the non-solicitation obligations or to clarify the
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer.
Arena agreed that any violations of the non-solicitation obligations of the Merger Agreement by its representatives
will be deemed to be a breach of the Merger Agreement by Arena.
In addition, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, Arena will promptly (but in no event later than three (3) business
days after the date of the Merger Agreement) demand that each person that has executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with a potential Arena Acquisition Proposal within the one (1)-year period prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement return (or destroy, to the extent permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement) all
confidential information furnished to such individual or entity by or on behalf of Arena or its subsidiaries.
At any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to receipt of the Requisite Vote, Arena and its
representatives may furnish non-public information concerning Arena’s business, properties or assets to any person
in accordance with a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to Arena than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement entered into as of September 10, 2020 between Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
and Pfizer Inc., as amended by the First Amendment to Confidentiality Agreement made as of October 31, 2021, as it
may be further amended from time to time. Arena and its representatives may participate in discussions and
negotiations with such person concerning an Arena Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, such person has, in the
absence of any material breach of the non-solicitation obligations of the Merger Agreement, submitted a bona fide
proposal to Arena relating to such Arena Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors, is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal.
Relatedly, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Special Meeting, Arena will promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) notify Pfizer if Arena or its subsidiaries or representatives receives any (i) Arena
Acquisition Proposal or indication by any person that it is considering making an Arena Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
any request for non-public information requests related to any Arena Acquisition Proposals or (iii) any
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
inquiries or requests for discussions or negotiations with respect to any Arena Acquisition Proposal. Arena will
provide Pfizer promptly (and in any event within such forty-eight (48)-hour period) with the identity of such person
and a correct and complete copy of such Arena Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such
Arena Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such Arena
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications thereto. Arena has agreed to keep
Pfizer reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than 36 hours after the
occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Arena
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of
any written inquiries, correspondence, and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, Arena will promptly (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours)
notify Pfizer orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Arena Acquisition Proposal and will in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. Arena has agreed to not, and cause its
subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of the Merger Agreement that
would restrict Arena’s ability to provide such information to Pfizer.
Arena (A) will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or its subsidiaries is or becomes a
party and (B) will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce any such agreement,
unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Arena’s outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to Arena’s stockholders
under applicable law, in which event Arena may take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis to the Board of Directors, an Arena Acquisition
Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that Arena will not be prohibited from providing any
information to Pfizer (including regarding any such Arena Acquisition Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise
complying with, the non-solicitation obligations of the Merger Agreement. Arena has agreed to promptly provide to
Pfizer any non-public information concerning Arena or its subsidiaries provided or made available in accordance with
the foregoing description regarding Arena Acquisition Proposals, which was not previously provided or made
available to Pfizer.
As described below under the caption “-Effect of Termination; Termination Fees,” if Arena terminates the Merger
Agreement after the date of the Merger Agreement but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Arena’s
stockholders for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, Arena must pay the
Arena Termination Fee to Pfizer.

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the
recommendation that the holders of Arena common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect an Arena Adverse Recommendation
Change except as described below.
During the Pre-Closing Period, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the following (any such
action, an “Arena Adverse Recommendation Change”):
•
withdrawing, amending, changing, modifying for qualifying, or otherwise proposing publicly to withdraw,
amend, change, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Pfizer or Merger Sub, the recommendation of the
Board of Directors to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the “Arena Board Recommendation”);
•
failing to make the Arena Board Recommendation;
•
approving or recommending or declaring advisable, or otherwise proposing publicly to approve or
recommend or declare advisable, any Arena Acquisition Proposal;
•
if an Arena Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, failing to publicly recommend against such
Arena Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days of the request of Pfizer and fail to publicly
reaffirm the Arena Board Recommendation within such ten (10) business day period upon such request,
provided, that Pfizer may only make such request once with respect to any Arena Acquisition Proposal; or
75TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
failing to recommend against a tender or exchange offer related to an Arena Acquisition Proposal in any
position taken in accordance with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee of the Board of Directors will make any Arena Adverse
Recommendation Change and also may not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar agreement (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”)
providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any Arena Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement, as referenced above, and entered into in the circumstances referenced above).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Vote,
if Arena (i) receives an Arena Acquisition Proposal from a third party that is not in violation of such party’s
contractual obligations to Arena, (ii) a material breach by Arena of its non-solicitation obligations has not
contributed to the making of such Arena Acquisition Proposal and (iii) and the Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such Arena Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments of the Merger Agreement that are offered
in writing by Pfizer, the Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of the Shares in
accordance with law, (A) effect an Arena Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate the Merger Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, subject to the following:
•
Arena has agreed not to terminate the Merger Agreement, and any purported termination in accordance
with (B) above will be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination Arena (1) pays the Arena Termination Fee and (2) immediately following such termination
enters into a binding definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal; and
•
the Board of Directors may not effect a change of its recommendation in accordance with (A) above or
terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with (B) above unless (I) no material breach of Arena’s
obligations of the non-solicitation has occurred, (II) Arena has provided prior written notice to Pfizer, at
least four (4) business days in advance (the “Notice Period”), of its intention to take such action with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) (a “Determination
Notice”), and has contemporaneously provided a correct and complete copy of the proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, (III) prior to effecting such Arena Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement to entered into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, Arena has, and has caused its
representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Pfizer in good faith (to the extent Pfizer requests
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such
Arena Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (IV) following any negotiation
described in clause (III) above, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Arena Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, Arena must deliver
a new written notice to Pfizer and comply with the foregoing requirements with respect to such new written notice,
and the Notice Period will be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, except that the
references to four (4) business days will be deemed two (2) business days. Any Arena Adverse Recommendation
Change will not change the approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Additionally, the Board of Directors may make an Arena Adverse Recommendation Change in the absence of an
Arena Acquisition Proposal if an Arena Intervening Event has occurred, and the Board of Directors has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make an Arena Adverse Recommendation
Change on account of Arena Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, as long as Arena has
(i) provided to Pfizer at least four (4) business days’ prior written notice advising Pfizer that the Board of Directors
intends to take such action and specifying Arena Intervening Event in reasonable detail and (ii) during such four (4)
business day period, if requested by Pfizer, engaged in good faith negotiations with Pfizer to amend the Merger
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need or reason for Arena Adverse Recommendation Change.

Under the Merger Agreement, any rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in their respective organizational documents or indemnification agreements, in effect as of the
date of the Merger Agreement, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, will (i) survive the
Merger, (ii) continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, and (iii) not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at any time on or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Arena and its
subsidiaries with respect to actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification
is required by law. If any claim is asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within such six (6) year period,
all rights to indemnification with respect to any such claim or claims will continue until disposition of all such claims.
Additionally, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of Arena or its subsidiaries and any indemnification or other similar agreements of Arena disclosed in the
Arena disclosure schedules, in each case as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.
Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Indemnifying Parties will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as an officer or director against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any legal proceeding based on
or arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of Arena and its subsidiaries at or
prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising
under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, from the Effective Time until the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with eligible matters within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such
Indemnified Parties of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs
and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under the Merger Agreement.
Arena may (i) maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Current D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, so long as the
annual premium therefor would not be in excess of the Maximum Premium paid prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) on
terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy, purchase
(through a nationally recognized insurance broker) a six (6) year “tail policy” for the existing policy effective as of the
Effective Time, for a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, with respect to the Current D&O Insurance and
maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. However, if Arena’s or the Surviving Corporation’s
existing insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six (6) year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain as much directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as can be obtained
for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

The Merger Agreement provides that, until the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time (or an earlier termination of
the relevant employee’s employment), (i) each employee of Arena or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed
by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries following the Effective Time (a “Continuing
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
Employee”) will be provided an annual base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity that are, in each
case, no less favorable than the annual base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity provided to
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) Continuing Employees will be provided
long-term cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities (excluding the Arena ESPP) that are
substantially comparable to the long-term cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities provided to
similarly situated Pfizer employees based on levels of responsibility and seniority as determined by Pfizer and (iii)
Continuing Employees will be provided employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits (excluding equity compensation, change in control, transaction or retention payments, defined
benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation, severance benefits, post-retirement or retiree medical benefits (the
“Excluded Benefits”)) that (A) are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated Pfizer employees based on levels
of responsibility and seniority (excluding the Excluded Benefits).
Pfizer will provide, or will cause its affiliates to provide, each Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of
employment from Pfizer or any of their respective Affiliates during the twenty-four (24)-month period following the
Effective Time with the severance payments and benefits under the applicable severance plans of Arena disclosed in
the Arena disclosure schedules.
To the maximum extent permitted in accordance with applicable benefit plans of Pfizer or its Affiliates (other than with
respect to Excluded Benefits), each Continuing Employee who participates in any such plan will receive service credit
for all periods of employment with Arena or its subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
vesting and eligibility under Pfizer’s or any of Affiliate’s vacation program and any health and welfare plan (other
than any severance benefit plan), in each case, in accordance with the terms of such plans, to the same extent and for
the same purposes thereunder as such service was recognized under an analogous Benefit Plan in effect on the date
of the Merger Agreement. However, the foregoing will not apply (i) to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of (x) any “retirement savings
contribution” under any Pfizer employee plan providing 401(k) plan benefits (y) any retiree medical plan or defined
benefit plan or (z) any benefit plan, program or policy of Pfizer or the Surviving Corporation that is a frozen plan or
that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. If, on or after the Effective Time, any Continuing Employee becomes covered by any benefit plan
providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (a “Successor Plan”), other than the plan in which
he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Prior Plan”), Pfizer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (1) cause any restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents (except to the
extent such exclusions or requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Plan), and (2) permit such
Continuing Employee to take into account any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the plan year in which the employee elects to be covered by the Successor Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or
his or her covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such expenses were incurred during the applicable
period in which such employee or covered dependent was covered by a corresponding Prior Plan.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Arena is required to submit a
proposal to our stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Arena’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation is summarized in the section
captioned “The Merger-Interests of Arena’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.” The Board of Directors
encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in
this proxy statement. Accordingly, Arena is asking you to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Arena approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or
may become payable to Arena’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled ‘The Merger-Interests of Arena’s Directors

The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote
not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is
present, (i) a failure to vote virtually or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal, (ii) abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (iii)
broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Arena
common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance
with the instructions indicated thereon. If a stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting
preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Arena common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as
present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be
voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of Arena, that you vote “FOR” the approval, on
an advisory (non-binding) basis, of this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if the Board of
Directors determines that it is necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If the Board of Directors determines that it
is necessary or appropriate, we will ask our stockholders to vote only on this Adjournment Proposal and not to vote
on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the
Compensation Proposal.
In the Adjournment Proposal, we are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize the Board of
Directors, in its discretion, to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to
solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the
Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be
defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to
convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of
the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of Arena, that you vote “FOR” approval of this
proposal.

Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “ARNA.” As of December 30, 2021, there were 61,564,122
shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 52 stockholders of record. The actual number of
stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but
whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. We have never declared or paid any cash
dividends on our common stock.
On December 31, 2021, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price
for our common stock on Nasdaq was $92.94 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for
our common stock.
Following the Merger, there will be no further market for our common stock and it will be delisted from Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Exchange Act. As a result, following the Merger we will no longer file periodic reports with the
SEC. In the event that the Merger is not consummated, our payment of any future dividends would be at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition,
operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our Board of
Directors may deem relevant.

The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our capital stock as of December 31, 2021 by:
•
each person or group of affiliated persons, who we know to beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of
our outstanding common stock, each of whom we refer to as a five percent (5%) owner;

•
each of our directors; and
•
all of our current executive officers and directors as a group.

stock is based solely on information provided by such persons in filings with the SEC on Schedules 13D, 13G and
other filing made with the SEC on or before December 31, 2021. We have determined beneficial ownership in
accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons
who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules
include shares issuable pursuant to stock options and other rights to purchase shares of our common stock
exercisable within sixty (60) days of December 31, 2021. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified
in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them,

to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
Arena will hold the regular annual meeting of its stockholders in 2022 only if the Merger is not completed.
Stockholder Proposals for 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
To be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for next year’s annual meeting, stockholder proposals must be
in writing, addressed to our Corporate Secretary, and be received at our executive offices at 136 Heber Avenue, Suite
204, Park City, Utah 84060, no later than December 28, 2021. If you wish to submit a proposal (including a director
nomination) that is not to be included in our proxy materials for next year’s annual meeting, notice of any such
proposal must be received at our executive offices no earlier than January 27, 2022, and no later than February 16,
2022; provided, however, that, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than twenty (20)
days prior to or delayed by more than seventy (70) days after the first anniversary of the initial mailing of definitive
proxy materials with respect to the preceding year’s annual meeting, for your notice to be timely, it must be so
received by the Corporate Secretary not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the seventieth (70th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth
(10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. The above
dates in this section may change under circumstances set forth in our Bylaws or if we amend the relevant provisions
in our Bylaws. If we amend our Bylaws, we will file the amended Bylaws with the SEC. Stockholders may request a
copy of the bylaw provisions relating to stockholder proposals from our Corporate Secretary at the same address.
You are also advised to review our Bylaws, which contain additional requirements for advance notice of stockholder
proposals.
Notices of intention to present proposals at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders should be addressed to our
Corporate Secretary, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204, Park City, Utah 84060. We reserve the
right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with
these and any other applicable requirements.",98,98
ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS INC_20220103_DEFM14A_19751337_4360734.Pdf,Householding of Special Meeting Materials,"Householding of Special Meeting Materials
The SEC’s rules permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements, annual reports and Internet Notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address
by delivering a single proxy statement and one annual report or Internet Notice addressed to those stockholders.
This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially results in a reduced usage of natural
resources and cost savings for companies.
A number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be “householding” our proxy materials. A
single proxy statement and one annual report or Internet Notice will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an
address unless contrary instructions have been received from one or more of the affected stockholders. Once you
have received notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address,
“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. Any stockholder at a
shared address to which a single copy of the documents or Internet Notice was delivered and who wishes to receive
a separate copy of the documents or Internet Notice can request a copy of such documents or notice by sending a
written request to Corporate Secretary, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204, Park City, Utah
84060, or by contacting our Corporate Secretary at (858) 453-7200 and we will promptly deliver the requested
documents or notice. Also, if, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to
receive a separate proxy statement and annual report or Internet Notice in the future, please notify your broker or
direct your written request to Corporate Secretary, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 136 Heber Avenue, Suite 204, Park
City, Utah 84060, or contact our Corporate Secretary at (858) 453-7200. Stockholders who currently receive multiple
copies of the proxy statement or Internet Notice at their address and would like to request “householding” of their
communications should contact their broker.

The Board of Directors
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
6154 Nancy Ridge Drive
San Diego, CA 92121
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December 12, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), with Pfizer Inc. (the “Acquiror”) and Antioch
Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares to be
cancelled pursuant to section 2.1(b) of the Merger Agreement and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $100 per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Consideration to be received by holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we
deemed to be relevant;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by
management of the Company, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Projections”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the
Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Projections;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger
with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed
relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, dated December 12, 2021; and
(viii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to,
discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed
responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further relied upon the
assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections, we have assumed with your consent
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other
matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement and that all
conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have
further assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents,
approvals
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or
condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the
contemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or
assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company
under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to
the holders of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. We do not
express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative
to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without
limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our
opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that
might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage
in the Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in
respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should act or vote in
respect of the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common
Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the
Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability
of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts
and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent
upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us
against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore
Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company
and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In addition, during the two year
period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial
advisory or other services to the Acquiror and we have not received any compensation from the Acquiror during
such period. We may provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror in the future, and
in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and the
accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research,
private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or
otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as investment
funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short
positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt
or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the
Company, the Acquiror, potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or persons that are
competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company or the Acquiror.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of this
opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.

mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be
received by holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

With respect to the information used in arriving at our opinion:
•
We have relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry,
business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information provided by or
discussed with Arena (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided Information) or obtained from
public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.
•
We (i) do not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness,
reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and we have not independently verified, any
such information (including, without limitation, the Arena-Provided Information), (ii) express no view or
opinion regarding the (a) reasonableness or achievability of the Arena-Provided Financial Projections, any
other estimates and any other forward-looking information provided by Arena or the assumptions upon
which any of the foregoing are based or (b) reasonableness of the probability adjustments reflected in the
Arena-Provided Financial Projections and (iii) have relied upon the assurances of Arena’s senior
management that they are unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make the Arena-Provided
Information incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.
•
Specifically, with respect to (i) the Arena-Provided Financial Projections utilized in our analyses, (a) we
have been advised by Arena’s senior management, and we have assumed, that the Arena-Provided
Financial Projections (including the probability adjustments reflected therein and the expected development
and commercialization of Arena’s products and product candidates) have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Arena’s senior management as to
the expected future performance of Arena on a stand-alone basis and (b) we have assumed that the Arena-
Provided Financial Projections have been reviewed by Arena’s Board of Directors with the understanding
that such information will be used and relied upon by us in connection with rendering our opinion and (ii)
any financial projections/forecasts, any other estimates and/or any other forward-looking information
obtained by us from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties, we have assumed that such
information is reasonable and reliable.
During the course of our engagement, we were asked by Arena’s Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest
from various potential strategic acquirors regarding a potential extraordinary corporate transaction with or involving
Arena, and we have considered the results of such solicitation process in rendering our opinion.
In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(including any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Arena or any other entity or the
solvency or fair value of Arena or any other entity, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. We are not
legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and nothing in our opinion should be
construed as constituting advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, we have relied on the assessments of,
Arena’s senior management and Arena’s other professional advisors with respect to such matters. We are not
expressing any view or rendering any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to Arena or its
securityholders.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that, in all respects meaningful to our analyses, (i) Arena and Pfizer will
comply with all terms and provisions of the Agreement and (ii) the representations and warranties of Arena and Pfizer
contained in the Agreement are true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each party to the Agreement
to consummate the Merger will be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification thereof. We also have
assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and
in compliance with all applicable legal and other requirements, without any delays, limitations, restrictions,
conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that would have an effect on

We have acted as a financial advisor to Arena in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for
such services, a substantial portion of which is payable upon successful consummation of the Merger and a portion
of which is payable upon the earlier of the rendering of our opinion or execution of a definitive agreement with
respect to the Merger. In addition, Arena has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us against
certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
As previously disclosed, aside from our current engagement by Arena, during the past two years we have separately
been engaged by each Arena and Pfizer, in each case to provide financial advisory or other investment banking
services in connection with various matters unrelated to the Merger, for which we have received agreed upon fees.
We may seek to provide Arena and Pfizer and their respective affiliates with financial advisory and investment
banking services unrelated to the Merger in the future, for which services we would also expect to receive
compensation.
We and our affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for our and their own
accounts and the accounts of customers, including but not limited to: asset, investment and wealth management;
insurance services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant
banking; fixed income and equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the
ordinary course of these activities, we and our affiliates and related entities may (i) provide such financial services to
Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates, for which services we and our affiliates
and related entities may have received, and may in the future receive, compensation and (ii) directly and indirectly
hold long and short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to loans, debt and
equity securities and derivative products of or relating to Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger and their
respective affiliates. Furthermore, we and our affiliates and related entities and our or their respective directors,
officers, employees, consultants and agents may have investments in Arena, Pfizer, other participants in the Merger
and their respective affiliates.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, we have adopted certain policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of our research departments and personnel. As a result, our research
analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect
to Arena, Pfizer or other participants in the Merger and their respective affiliates and the Merger that differ from the
views of our investment banking personnel.
Our opinion has been provided to Arena’s Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) for its information and
assistance in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Consideration. Our opinion may not be disclosed publicly,
made available to third parties or reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part,
without our prior written consent; provided, however, that this letter may be included in its entirety in any proxy
statement to be distributed to the holders of Arena common stock in connection with the Merger.
Our opinion and any materials provided in connection therewith do not constitute a recommendation to Arena’s
Board of Directors with respect to the Merger, nor does our opinion or any summary of our underlying analyses
constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of Arena common stock as to how to vote or act in connection
with the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion does not address Arena’s underlying business or financial decision to
pursue or effect the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or financial
strategies that might exist for Arena or the effects of any other transaction in which Arena might engage. Our opinion
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the Merger Consideration to
holders of Arena shares. We do not express any view or opinion as to (i) any other term, aspect or implication of (a)
the Merger (including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger) or the Agreement or (b) any other
agreement, transaction document or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or to be entered into or amended in
connection with the Merger or (ii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the Merger to, or of any consideration to be
paid to or received by, the holders of any class of securities (other than as expressly specified herein), creditors or
other

constituencies of Arena. Furthermore, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of Arena’s directors,
officers or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise.
Our opinion has been authorized for issuance by our Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee. Our opinion is
subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained herein and is necessarily based
on economic, business, capital markets and other conditions, and the information made available to us, as of the date
hereof. As Arena is aware, global economic conditions and the global capital markets have been experiencing and
remain subject to unusual volatility, and Guggenheim Securities expresses no view or opinion as to any potential
effects of such volatility on Arena, Pfizer or the Merger. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our
opinion based on facts, circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to holders of Arena shares.
Very truly yours,

(a) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock will be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist, and no consideration will be payable in exchange therefor.
(c) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $100 (the “Merger Consideration”). From and after the Effective
Time, all such Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate share (a “Certificate”) or book-entry share (a “Book-Entry Share”)
representing any such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the

(a) Paying Agent. Parent will designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares in connection with
the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the funds to which holders of the Shares will become
A-2TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying
Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly after the Effective Time (and no later
than the same day as the Effective Time occurs to the extent that the Effective Time is before 1:00 p.m. New York
time, or else, the next business day) and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for
the Shares converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”). If
the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of the Shares are entitled in accordance
with Section 2.1(c), Parent will promptly deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit,
additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will
be paid to Parent.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days
thereafter), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, whose shares were converted in accordance with Section 2.1(c)
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the
Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly
completed and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (such payments to be net of
applicable Taxes withheld in accordance with Section 2.5) for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon, and will
not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this SECTION 2.
In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the
Merger Consideration will upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Share, and the Book-Entry
Shares of such holder will forthwith be cancelled.
(c) Transfer Taxes. If any payment in accordance with the Merger is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition of
payment that (i) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will have any liability for the transfer
Taxes and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.2(c) under any circumstances.
(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company will be closed and, thereafter no further registration of transfers of Shares will be made on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, then they will be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this SECTION 2.
(e) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
A-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which
disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent’s routine administrative procedures) to holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Nonetheless, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent will
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.
(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares
(the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and after the
Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such appraisal rights will not have any rights of a
stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such Shares held by him, her or it in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal, in which case such Shares will be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in accordance
with Section 2.2.
(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal (including
copies of such demands), attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other communications received by
the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of Shares subject to the 2022 Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the RSU Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest
whole share. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such
2022 Company RSU immediately prior the Effective Time (including vesting terms, and including any
acceleration of vesting provisions applicable to such 2022 Company RSU set forth in Section 5.01(b)(C) of the

Company PRSU), an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the Merger Consideration (such payments, if
any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld in accordance with Section 2.5 and without interest). As of the

other than the rights of a holder to receive any payment contemplated by this Section 2.4(d).

program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be cancelled. As of the Effective Time, the RSUs granted

or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.4, including sending any requisite notices,

with respect to any Benefit Plan that reasonably would be expected to subject the Company, Company
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation to any material Tax or material penalty.

(a) The Company shall cease and terminate, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to cease and terminate, all solicitations, discussions, and negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal as of the date of this Agreement. Except as provided in this Section 5.2, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company will
not and will cause its Representatives not to directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
facilitate the making of any offer or proposal which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into any agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (C)
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public information or data to, any Person (other
than Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or grant
any waiver or release under any restriction from making a Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case, other
than discussions solely to notify such Person of the terms of this Section 5.2 or to clarify the terms and
conditions of such proposal or offer. The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.2 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this
Section 5.2) by the Company.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company and its
Representatives may furnish non-public information concerning the Company’s business, properties or assets
to any Person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to
the

Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and may participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, such Person has, in
the absence of any material breach of Section 5.2(a), submitted a bona fide proposal to the Company relating to
such Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors, is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. From and after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Stockholders Meeting, the Company will promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Representative
receives (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company will provide Parent promptly (and in any event within such forty-
eight (48) hour period) with the identity of such Person and a correct and complete copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such Company Acquisition Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication,
inquiry or request), including any modifications thereto. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed
(orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than thirty-six (36) hours after the occurrence
of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any
modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies
of any written inquiries, correspondence, and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral
inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly (and in any event within
thirty-six (36) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal and will in no event begin
providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The
Company will not, and will cause each Company Subsidiary not to, enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Company’s ability to provide such information
to Parent. The Company (A) will not, and will cause each Company Subsidiary not to, terminate, waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to
which it or any Company Subsidiary is or becomes a party, and (B) will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary
to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce any such agreement unless the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the Company’s
stockholders under applicable Law, in which event the Company may take the actions described in these clauses
(A) and (B) solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis to the Company
Board of Directors, a Company Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that the
Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such
Company Acquisition Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this Section 5.2. The
Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company
Subsidiary provided or made available in accordance with this Section 5.2(b) which was not previously provided
or made available to Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Superior Proposal” is a written Company
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or involve a material breach of this Section 5.2 and that proposes
an acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries on terms which the Company Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment to be more favorable to the holders of the Shares than the transactions contemplated hereby
(after consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement, which the Company Board of Directors has determined to be as or more
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal and the terms of this
Agreement.
(c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof will (i) make
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar agreement (an
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
A-34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referenced in Section 5.2(b) entered into
in the circumstances referenced in Section 5.2(b)). The Company, promptly following a determination by the
Company Board of Directors that a Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, will notify Parent of
such determination.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.2(c) to the contrary, prior to the date on which the Company
Requisite Vote is obtained, if (i) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal from a third Person that
is not in violation of such third Person’s contractual obligations to the Company, (ii) a material breach by the
Company of Section 5.2, has not contributed to the making of such Company Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the
Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of
the adjustments of this Agreement that are offered in writing by Parent, the Company Board of Directors may, if
it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of the Shares in accordance with Law, (A) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company will not terminate this
Agreement in accordance with clause (B) above, and any purported termination in accordance with clause (B)
above will be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the
Company (1) pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2 and (2) immediately following such
termination enters into a binding definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal;
provided, further, that the Company Board of Directors may not effect a change of its recommendation in
accordance with clause (A) above or terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause (B) above unless (I) no
material breach of the Company’s obligations in Section 5.2 has occurred, (II) the Company has provided prior
written notice to Parent, at least four (4) business days in advance (the “Notice Period”), of its intention to take
such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions
of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and has
contemporaneously provided a correct and complete copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, (III) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (IV) following any negotiation described in clause (3) above, the Company Board of Directors
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the Company is required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(d) with respect to such new written notice, and
the Notice Period will be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, except that the
references to four (4) business days shall be deemed two (2) business days. Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change will not change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of
causing any state takeover statute or other Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.
(e) The Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in the absence
of a Company Acquisition Proposal if a Company Intervening Event has occurred, and the Company Board of
Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change on account of the Company Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, provided, however, that the Company Board of Directors will not make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least four (4)
business days’ prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such
action and specifying the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail and (ii) during such four (4) business
day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that obviates the need or reason for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
(f) The Company will promptly (but in no event later than three (3) business days after the date of this
Agreement) demand that each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with a
A-35

furnished to such individual or entity by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any “stop, look and listen”
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; provided that this Section 5.2(g) will not be
deemed to permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change

correcting any information that has become false or misleading in any material respect, the Company will promptly
prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Parent and their counsel shall be given a

officers of the Company and the directors or officers of each Company Subsidiary (the “Indemnified Parties”
and, each, an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in their respective organizational documents or indemnification
agreements, in effect as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the

repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time on or prior to the Effective Time were
directors or officers of the Company or directors or officers of any Company Subsidiary with respect to actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), unless
such modification is required by Law; provided, however, that if any claim is asserted or made either prior to the
Effective Time or within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification with respect to any such claim or
claims will continue until disposition of all such claims.
(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any indemnification or
other similar agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to
perform their obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
(together with its successors and assigns, the “Indemnifying Parties”) to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Party as an officer
or director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary in connection with any pending or threatened proceeding
based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer
of the Company or a Company Subsidiary at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) the Indemnifying Parties shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Laws, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses

fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Parties of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay
such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section
6.6(b).
(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Company may (i) maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for
six (6) years from the Effective Time, the current policies of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
maintained by the Company (the “Current D&O Insurance”) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), so long as the annual premium
therefor would not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
Effective Time (such three hundred percent (300%), the “Maximum Premium”), or (ii) on terms with respect to
coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy, purchase (through a nationally
recognized insurance broker) a six (6) year “tail policy” for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time,
for a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, with respect to the Current D&O Insurance (a “Reporting
Tail Endorsement”) and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Company’s or
the Surviving Corporation’s existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six (6) year period
or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of
such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.
(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of such Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6,

Company’s 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger). In the event that
Parent requests that the Company’s 401(k) Plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”) be terminated, the Company will provide
Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which will be
subject to review and approval by Parent). If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, as provided herein, Parent shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan as of the

eligible to participate as of the Closing, and as soon as practicable following the Closing, the assets thereof shall be

Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions”
within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code (including promissory notes evidencing outstanding participant
loans), in the form of cash (and in-kind in the case of participant loan notes), in an amount equal to the full account
balance distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an
outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date to continue to make scheduled loan

payments to the Company 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the notes
evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan so as to prevent, to the extent
reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans, provided, that, as a
condition to the foregoing, such Continuing Employees shall cooperate with the Company and Parent to take
appropriate action to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable

favorable than the annual base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) Continuing Employees will be provided
long-term cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities (excluding the Company ESPP) that are
substantially comparable to the long-term cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities
provided to similarly situated Parent employees based on levels of responsibility and seniority as determined by
Parent and (iii) Continuing Employees will be provided employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the employee benefits (excluding equity compensation, change in control, transaction or
retention payments, defined benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation, severance benefits, post-retirement or
retiree medical benefits (the “Excluded Benefits”)) that (A) are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
(B) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated
Parent employees based on levels of responsibility and seniority (excluding the Excluded Benefits). Nothing
herein is intended to result in a duplication of benefits.
(b) Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each Continuing Employee who experiences a
termination of employment from Parent or any of their respective Affiliates during the twenty-four (24)-month
period following the Effective Time with the severance payments and benefits under the applicable severance
plans set forth on Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) To the maximum extent permitted in accordance with applicable benefit plans of Parent or its Affiliates

receive service credit for all periods of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting and eligibility under Parent’s or any of Affiliate’s vacation
program and any health and welfare plan (other than any severance benefit plan), in each case, in accordance
with the terms of such plans, to the same extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such service was
recognized under an analogous Benefit Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that the
foregoing will not apply (i) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect

benefits to a grandfathered employee population, either with respect to level of benefits or participation;
provided, further, that the Corporation has made available to Parent such information as is reasonably requested
by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.8(c). If, on or after the Effective Time, any Continuing
Employee becomes covered by any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits (a “Successor Plan”), other than the plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a “Prior Plan”), Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause any restrictions or
limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents (except to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Plan), and (2) permit such Continuing Employee to
take into account any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the plan year in which the employee elects to be covered by the Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or his or her
covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such expenses were incurred during the applicable period in
which such employee or covered dependent was covered by a corresponding Prior Plan.
