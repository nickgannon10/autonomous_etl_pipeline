On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with
Parent and Merger Sub, providing for, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of
specified conditions, the acquisition of the Company by Parent at a price of $39.00 in cash, without interest, per share
of common stock (the “merger consideration”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”), with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A
to this proxy statement.
2TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the merger is consummated, at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), each share of common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (except for (i) shares of common stock owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of common stock (A) held in trust accounts, managed accounts,
mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, or (B) held, directly or indirectly, in
respect of a debt previously contracted) and (ii) any shares of common stock with respect to which dissenters’ rights
have been exercised) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to the merger consideration.
If the merger is consummated, the class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the class A common stock will no longer be publicly traded.

meeting-will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any postponement or adjournment
thereof. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 28,014,299 shares of common stock outstanding

outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter (the “Cowen stockholder approval”). Under Delaware law and the
merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Approval of
the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal is not a condition to the consummation of the
merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation
proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.

(page 64)
Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Ardea Partners LP (“Ardea”), the Company retained
Ardea as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
At a meeting of the Board held on August 1, 2022, representatives of Ardea rendered to the Board Ardea’s oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated August 1, 2022 and delivered to the Board, to the effect
that, as of the date of Ardea’s written opinion, and based upon, and subject to, the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock, without interest, to be paid to the holders of shares of
class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of Ardea’s written opinion, dated August 1, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken in connection
with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the Ardea opinion contained in
this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Ardea’s written opinion. Ardea
provided its’s advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board in

continue to exist following the merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

In the event that the Cowen stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any other
reason, Cowen stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the
merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the class A common stock will continue to
be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the class A common stock will continue to be registered
under the Exchange Act and Cowen stockholders will continue to own their shares of common stock and will
continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of
the common stock.

As of the effective time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and any individual holder, all
outstanding awards granted under the Company’s 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan and 2020 Equity Incentive Plan,
each as amended from time to time (the “Equity Plans”), will be treated as follows:
•
each outstanding (i) restricted stock unit award (“Company RSU”) that is or will become vested at the
effective time in accordance with its terms and (ii) performance stock unit award (“Company PSU”) for
which the applicable performance period is complete but has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to
the effective time, in each case, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of class A common stock subject to such Company RSU
or Company PSU (based on actual performance) , and (B) the merger consideration, less applicable taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment;
•
each outstanding Company RSU (other than Director RSUs (as defined below)) that is not and will not
become vested at the effective time in accordance with its terms will be assumed by Parent, subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the effective time, except
that such Company RSU shall be in respect of a number of Parent common shares that is equal to (i) the
number of shares of class A common stock underlying such Company RSU, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, (A)
the numerator of which is the merger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is the average closing
price, rounded to the nearest cent, per Parent common share on the New York Stock Exchange for the
period of ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the closing date (the
“Exchange Ratio”);
•
each outstanding deferred cash award (“Company DCA”) that is or will become vested at the effective time
in accordance with its terms will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the amount of such Company DCA, plus any then-accrued and unpaid interest, less applicable
taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment;
•
each outstanding Company DCA that is not and will not become vested at the effective time will be
assumed by Parent, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Company DCA;
•
each outstanding Company PSU for which the applicable performance period is not complete as of
immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by Parent, subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to such Company PSU, immediately prior to the effective time, except that such assumed
Company PSU shall (i) no longer be subject to performance conditions following the effective time and (ii)
be in respect of a number of Parent common shares that is equal to (A) the number of shares of class A
common stock underlying such Company PSU, based on target level of performance (other than any
Company PSU for which the applicable performance period ends on or before December 31, 2022, in which
case, such assumption will be based on the actual achievement of applicable performance goals prior to the
effective time), multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; and
•
each outstanding Company RSU held by directors of the Board (“Director RSU”) (whether vested or
unvested) immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of class A common stock subject to such
Director RSU and (ii) the merger consideration.

(page 70)
The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these
interests in reaching the determination to approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
merger agreement and unanimously recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve the merger proposal.
These interests may include:
•
the treatment of Company equity awards (as described below in “The Merger-Treatment of Compensation
Awards of Directors and Executive Officers”);
•
certain compensation arrangements pursuant to new employment agreements between executive officers of
the Company and Parent, which will be effective on, and contingent upon, the closing of the merger,
including severance and other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations and one-time cash-
based retention or integration bonuses; and
•
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the Company’s
organizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of its
directors and executive officers.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section entitled “The Merger-
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 70 of this proxy
statement.

As of September 29, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the aggregate
1,858,433 shares of common stock, or approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock. We currently
expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares of common stock in favor of each of the
proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

The consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of any financing. Parent and Merger Sub
have represented in the merger agreement that they have sufficient funds or access thereto, and Parent will at the
closing have immediately available funds in cash, to pay when due all amounts payable by it under the merger
agreement and to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement. Parent has acknowledged that the obligations of
Parent under the merger agreement are not contingent upon or subject to any conditions regarding Parent’s, its
affiliates’, or any other person’s ability to obtain financing or otherwise to raise capital for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of the merger consideration.
Litigation Related to the Merger
(page 83)
On September 27, 2022, a complaint, captioned Stein v. Cowen Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08254, was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported Cowen stockholder, on September
28, 2022, a complaint, captioned O’Dell v. Cowen Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08297, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported Cowen stockholder, on September 29, 2022, a
complaint, captioned Alberts v. Cowen Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08319, was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported Cowen stockholder and on October 7, 2022, a complaint,
captioned Bushansky v. Cowen Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08551, was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York by a purported Cowen stockholder, in each case, naming as defendants Cowen and
members of the Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a
materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. We have also received certain
stockholder disclosure demand letters.
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger,
requiring the defendants to disclose allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the proxy
statement, rescinding the Merger to the extent already consummated or in the event that it is consummated or
granting rescissory damages, awarding costs, including attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such
other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
The defendants believe that the complaints and demands are without merit and that no further disclosure is required
to supplement the proxy statement under applicable laws. As of October 10, 2022, Cowen was not aware of the filing
of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits may be filed in the future.

required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the closing date, and Cowen shall
have received a certificate dated as of the closing date and signed on behalf of TD by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of TD to such effect.

(page 80)
To complete the merger, Cowen and TD are required to obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a
number of U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, Cowen and TD
have agreed to, and to cause their respective subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperation with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Cowen, TD and Merger Sub will cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and, in the case of the requisite
regulatory approvals, make such filings within forty-five (45) days of August 1, 2022 (subject to the timely receipt by
the party making such filing of all necessary information from the other party as may be reasonably requested for the
preparation of such filing), (ii) promptly (and no later than any deadline imposed by such governmental entity)
supply such information and documentary material as may be reasonably responsive to any request made by any
governmental entity in connection with such applications, notices, petitions and filings, (iii) obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and governmental which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the merger)
as promptly as practicable, and (iv) comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such governmental entities. The term “requisite regulatory approvals” includes the
approvals set forth under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Reasonable
Efforts; Regulatory Matters” beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, nothing contained in the merger agreement will be deemed to require TD
and its subsidiaries (and Cowen and its subsidiaries will not be permitted without the prior written consent of TD) to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining the
requisite regulatory approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of Cowen and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the business, results of operations or financial condition of TD and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (which, for the purpose of this sentence, will be deemed to be the same size as Cowen
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a “materially burdensome regulatory condition”).
The approval of an application means only that the regulatory criteria for approval have been satisfied or waived. It
does not mean that the approving authority has determined that the merger consideration to be received by Cowen
stockholders in the merger is fair. Regulatory approval does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the
merger.
Cowen and TD have filed all notices and applications necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals.
Although each of Cowen and TD does not know of any reason related to it or its respective subsidiaries, as
applicable, why the requisite regulatory approvals will not be received to permit the consummation of the merger on a
timely basis, Cowen and TD cannot be certain when or if the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained, or that
the granting of these regulatory approvals will not involve the imposition of conditions on the completion of the
merger.

that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
•
prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information, Cowen has entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the person making such acquisition proposal on terms no less favorable to Cowen than the
confidentiality agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill) and

proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal and the substance
thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
acquisition proposal), provide TD with an unredacted copy of any such acquisition proposal and any draft

current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or

approval, if TD has irrevocably waived receipt of such requisite regulatory approval as a condition to the
closing) or (ii) any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction will have issued a final and nonappealable
legal restraint or legal prohibition enjoining, preventing, prohibition or otherwise making illegal the
consummation of the merger, unless the principal cause of such legal restraint or legal prohibition will be
the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the obligations,
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement;
•
by either Cowen or TD if the merger has not been consummated on or before August 1, 2023 (such time or
such later time agreed in writing by Cowen and TD, the “termination date”), unless the principal cause of
the failure of the closing to occur by such date is the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger
agreement to perform or observe its obligations, covenants and agreements under the merger agreement;
•
by either Cowen or TD (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement) if

warranties (or any such representation or warranty ceases to be true) set forth in the merger agreement on

breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or
failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on
the closing date, the failure of certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement and which are not cured
within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Cowen, in the case of a termination by TD, or TD, in
the case of a termination by Cowen, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such
fewer days as remain prior to the termination date);

each outstanding Company RSU (other than Director RSUs) that is or will become vested at the effective

Q:
When and where is the special meeting of our stockholders?
A:
The special meeting of stockholders of the Company will be held on November 15, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern
Time in a virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, you should visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/COWN2022SM. You will be required to enter a control number, included on
your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive, which will allow you to participate
in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a Cowen stockholder as of the record
date.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
Only holders of record of shares of the Company’s class A common stock at the close of business on September
29, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting
and any postponement or adjournment thereof. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
28,014,299 shares of class A common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each such stockholder is entitled
to one vote per share of class A common stock held by such stockholder on the record date on each of the
proposals presented in this proxy statement. Holders of shares of class B common stock and holders of shares
of preferred stock of the Company are not entitled to vote on the merger proposal, the advisory compensation
proposal or the adjournment proposal.
If on September 29, 2022, you were a “record” holder of class A common stock (that is, if you held class A
common stock in your own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare), you are
entitled to vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you intend to attend the virtual special
meeting, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote now, online, by phone or by proxy card to ensure that
your vote is counted.
If on September 29, 2022, you were the beneficial owner of class A common stock held in “street name” (that
is, if you held class A common stock through your broker), then these materials are being
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
forwarded to you by your broker. You may direct your broker how to vote your class A common stock by
following the voting instructions on the form provided by your broker. If you hold any class A common stock
through your broker and wish to attend the virtual special meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting
but may not be able to vote unless you first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from your broker or other
nominee. The cut-off time for submitting a legal proxy is November 14, 2022 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.
Q:
What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?
A:
At the special meeting, Cowen stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
a proposal to adopt the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”);
•
a proposal to approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger (the “advisory
compensation proposal”); and
•
a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the
“adjournment proposal”).
Q:
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?
A:
The presence in person or by proxy of any number of stockholders, together holding at least a majority of the
capital stock of Cowen issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a
quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in
person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum.
If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the Cowen stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting,
present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. The adjourned meeting may take place without
further notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the
merger agreement, including that the special meeting generally may not be held, without TD’s consent, on a date
that is more than seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or postponement or more
than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate after the date on which the special meeting was originally
scheduled). In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to
approve the merger proposal at the time of the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be
postponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
Q:
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
A:
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt
of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the
merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice
versa. Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Cowen stockholder’s
behalf) will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of
class A common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special
meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to
vote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the
outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the
number of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the advisory compensation
proposal.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A
common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
vote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the
outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the
number of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the adjournment proposal.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special
meeting.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to unanimously recommend the
approval of the merger proposal, see the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger” beginning on
page 53 of this proxy statement.
Q:
How do the Company’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
A:
As of September 29, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the
aggregate 1,858,433 shares of common stock, or approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock.
Although none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger proposal, we
currently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares in favor of each of the proposals
to be presented at the special meeting.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, my interests as a Company stockholder?
A:
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, you should be aware that the Company’s
directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
your interests as a Company stockholder. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these
interests in reaching the determination to approve the merger proposal and unanimously recommend that
Company stockholders approve the merger proposal. These interests may include:
•
the treatment of Company equity awards (as described below in “The Merger-Treatment of Compensation
Awards for Directors and Executive Officers”);
•
certain compensation arrangements pursuant to new employment agreements between executive officers
and Parent, which will be effective on, and contingent upon, the closing of the merger, including severance
and other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations and one-time cash-based retention or
integration bonuses; and
•
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the Company’s
organizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of its
directors and executive officers.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section entitled “The
Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 70 of this
proxy statement.
Q:
What happens if I transfer my class A common stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own class A
common stock on the record date but transfer your shares of class A common stock after the record date but
prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of class A common stock at the special
meeting. However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred
your shares of class A common stock.
Q:
How do I vote if I am a Cowen stockholder of record?
A:
If you are a Cowen stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the special
meeting via the internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in
the envelope provided. In order to submit a vote by proxy via the internet or telephone, follow the applicable
instructions shown on the proxy card mailed to you. You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting
and voting during the live webcast.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, see the section entitled “The Special
Meeting-Voting Procedures” beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your vote is
counted. You may still attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you have already
voted by proxy.
Q:
What will happen if abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
A:
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt
of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the
merger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice
versa. Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Cowen stockholder’s
behalf) will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of
the majority of shares of class A common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such
proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your
shares of common stock, to vote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will
have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the
purposes of determining the number of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against
these proposals.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
A:
Yes. For Cowen stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and before the proxy
card is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:
•
You may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy or
voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.
•
You may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Secretary at 599 Lexington Avenue, New
York, NY 10022.
•
You may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual
special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation
to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in
sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker
and in accordance with its procedures. If your broker allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by
telephone, you may be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or
by mail). In order to attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the webcast, you will need to obtain a
proxy from your broker, the Cowen stockholder of record.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or
multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your common stock in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold common stock. Please submit each proxy and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of
your shares of common stock are voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
If I hold my common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. Promptly after the effective time, and in any event not later than the fifth business day after the effective
time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of common stock entitled to the merger
consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such Cowen stockholder how to surrender its
common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of common stock will be entitled to receive
the merger consideration upon the surrender of such certificate for cancelation to the paying agent together with
the associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the paying agent. You should not return
your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the
paying agent without a letter of transmittal. If you hold common stock in non-certificated book-entry form, you
will not be required to deliver a stock certificate, and you will instead receive your cash payment after the paying
agent receives the documents requested in the applicable instruction.
Q:
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder?
A:
As a general matter, holders of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
and the approval of the merger and otherwise comply with the requirements of Delaware law will be entitled to
dissenters’ appraisal rights to receive the statutorily determined “fair value” of their shares of capital stock of
the Company. You should read the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 120 of this proxy
statement and Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the
following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, for a more
complete discussion of dissenters’ appraisal rights. Holders of shares of preferred stock of the Company will
also be entitled to dissenters’ appraisal rights to receive the statutorily determined “fair value” of their shares of
capital stock of the Company.
Q:
When is the merger expected to be consummated?
A:
We currently expect to consummate the merger during the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to receipt of the
Cowen stockholder approval and the required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.
Q:
What effect will the merger have on the Company?
A:
If the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will
continue to exist following the merger as a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is
consummated, the class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered
under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the
class A common stock will no longer be publicly traded.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
A:
In the event that the Cowen stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Cowen stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection
with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the class A common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the class A common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their
shares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they
currently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.
Under certain circumstances, Cowen will be required to pay TD a termination fee equal to $42,250,000.00 in cash
and, under certain other circumstances, TD will be required to pay Cowen an expense reimbursement including
(i) $10,000,000 for fees and expenses of third party advisors and other transaction costs, (ii) the aggregate face
amount of employee retention awards which have been allocated and communicated to employees of Cowen
(subject to certain limitations and requirements) and (iii) the designated capped amount for the premium of an
insurance policy that may, at the request of TD, be bound by Cowen pursuant to the merger agreement. For
more information, see the sections “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee” and “The Merger Agreement-
Expense Reimbursement” beginning on pages 111 and 112, respectively, of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more Cowen stockholders sharing
the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those Cowen stockholders. This process,
which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially means extra convenience for Cowen stockholders
and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are Cowen stockholders of the Company may be “householding” proxy
materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple Cowen stockholders sharing an address unless
contrary instructions have been received from the affected Cowen stockholders. If you have received notice
from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, such “householding” will
continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to
participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker
and direct your written request to Cowen Inc., Attention: Investor Relations Department, 599 Lexington Avenue,
New York, NY 10022. Cowen stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their
address and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact their broker.
Q:
Who can help answer my questions?

the merger, toll free at (855) 935-2549.

COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The information included in this proxy statement, together with other statements and information publicly
disseminated by Cowen, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Cowen
intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement for purposes of
complying with these safe harbor provisions.
In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking terms such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,”
“could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “possible,” “potential,”
“intend,” “seek,” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology or similar expressions.
These forward-looking statements represent only Cowen’s beliefs regarding future events (many of which, by their
nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Cowen’s control) and are predictions only, based on Cowen’s current
expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause Cowen’s actual
results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements, including, among others: (i) the parties’ ability to consummate the proposed transaction
within the expected time-frame or at all; (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the
proposed transaction, including the receipt of the required approval of Cowen’s stockholders with respect to the
proposed transaction and the receipt of regulatory clearances required to consummate the proposed transaction, in
each case, on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; (iii) the risk that the parties may be unable to
achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction within the expected time-frames or at all; (iv) the
possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for Cowen will be made; (v) the occurrence of any event
that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction, including in circumstances which would require
Cowen to pay a termination fee; (vi) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on
Cowen’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, clients,
vendors and others with whom it does business; (vii) risks related to diverting management’s attention from Cowen’s
ongoing business operations; and (viii) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed
transaction may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability and may delay the proposed
transaction.
In particular, you should consider the risks outlined under Item 1A - “Risk Factors” in Cowen’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Cowen’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
June 30, 2022, and subsequent reports Cowen has filed with the SEC. Although Cowen believes the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, Cowen cannot guarantee future results, level of activity,
performance or achievements. Moreover, none of Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy
or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements
as predictions of future events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made,
and Cowen undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date they are made
except to the extent required by applicable law. Further disclosures that Cowen makes on related subjects in
additional filings with the SEC should be consulted.

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the

merger proposal, see the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 53 of this proxy

The presence in person or by proxy of any number of stockholders, together holding at least a majority of the capital
stock of Cowen issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for
purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum
purposes at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will
be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the Cowen stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting,
present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. The adjourned meeting may take place without further
notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the merger
agreement, including that the special meeting generally may not be held, without TD’s consent, on a date that is more
than seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or postponement or more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled). In the event
that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at
the time of the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional
proxies.
Vote Required",33,33
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Vote Required,"Vote Required
Approval of the Merger Proposal
The approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such
required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger
proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Cowen stockholder’s behalf) will
have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.
Approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A
common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming
a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to vote at the virtual special
meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory
compensation proposal. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the number
of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the advisory compensation proposal.
The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger
proposal. Because the vote on the advisory compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on the
Company, the Board, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Accordingly, because the Company is contractually
obligated to pay the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection
with the consummation of the merger, if the merger is approved by our stockholders, such compensation will be
payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory
compensation proposal.
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal is not a condition to the consummation of the merger.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common
stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum
is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to vote at the virtual special meeting,
or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.
Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the number of votes required, and
therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the adjournment proposal. The Company does not intend to call
a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special meeting.

Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting and regardless of the number of shares of common
stock you own, your careful consideration of, and vote on, the merger agreement is important and we encourage you
to vote promptly. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that
you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, using one
of the following three methods:
•
Vote via the Internet. Go to www.proxyvote.com. Login details are located in the shaded bar on the proxy
card mailed to you.
•
Vote by Telephone. Call toll free 1-800-690-6903 within the USA, U.S. territories and Canada.
•
Vote by Proxy Card. If you do not wish to vote by the internet or by telephone, please complete, sign, date
and mail the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided.
You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live webcast.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, in other words your common stock is held in the name of your broker, you
should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather
than from the Company. In order to vote, complete and mail the proxy card received from your broker to ensure that
your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over the internet as instructed by your broker. To
vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker. The cut-off time for submitting a
legal proxy is November 14, 2022 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Follow the instructions from your broker included with
these proxy materials or contact your broker to request a proxy form. The timing described in the instructions from
your broker may differ from the timing described above. Without following those instructions, your common stock
held in “street name” will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
For additional questions about the merger, assistance in submitting proxies or voting, or to request additional copies
of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Alliance Advisors LLC, which is acting as the
Company’s proxy solicitation agent in connection with the merger, toll free at (855) 935-2549.
How Proxies Are Voted
If you complete and submit your proxy card or voting instructions, the persons named as proxies will follow your
instructions. If you are a holder of record and you submit a proxy card or voting instructions but do not direct how to
vote on each item, the persons named as proxies therein will vote in favor of the merger proposal, the advisory
compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.
Revocation of Proxies
For Cowen stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and before the proxy card is
exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:
•
You may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy or
voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.
•
You may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Secretary at 599 Lexington Avenue, New
York, NY 10022.
•
You may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual
special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation to
the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time
for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker and in
accordance with its procedures. If your broker allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by telephone, you may
be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or by mail). In order to
attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the webcast, you will need to obtain a proxy from your broker, the
Cowen stockholder of record.
Solicitation of Proxies
The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies, including the expense of preparing, printing and distributing this
proxy statement. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, telephone or electronic means, we may request brokers to
solicit their customers and will, upon request, reimburse them for the reasonable, out-of-pocket costs of forwarding
proxy materials in accordance with customary practice. We may also use the services of our directors, officers and
other employees to solicit proxies, personally or by telephone, without additional compensation. In addition, the
Company has retained Alliance Advisors LLC to solicit proxies at a total cost to the Company of approximately
$20,000, plus reimbursement of customary expenses.
Appraisal Rights
As a general matter, holders of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
the approval of the merger and otherwise comply with the requirements of Delaware law will be entitled to dissenters’
appraisal rights to receive the statutorily determined “fair value” of their shares of capital stock of the Company. You
should read the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 120 of this proxy statement and Section 262
of the DGCL, a copy of which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available
website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, for a more complete discussion of dissenters’
appraisal rights. Holders of shares of preferred stock will of the Company also be entitled to dissenters’ appraisal
rights to receive the statutorily determined “fair value” of their shares of capital stock of the Company.
Postponements and Adjournments
Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the Cowen stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting by a majority vote.
At any subsequent reconvening of the special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be
transacted that might have been transacted at the special meeting, and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as
they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been
validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the reconvened meeting.
The date, time and place of the reconvened meeting shall be either (i) announced at the special meeting or (ii)
provided at a future time through means announced at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the
merger agreement, including that the reconvened meeting generally may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a
date that is more than seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment, or more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate, after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).
Voting by Company Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Securityholders
As of September 29, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the aggregate
1,858,433 shares of common stock, or approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock. Although
none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger proposal, we currently expect
that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares in favor of each of the proposals to be presented at the
special meeting.
The Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger-
Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 70 of this proxy
statement.

We are asking holders of common stock to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act, we are asking holders of common stock to approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the
consummation of the merger. As required by those rules, the Company is asking holders of common stock to vote on
the approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers
in connection with the consummation of the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled “Potential Payments to Named
Executive Officers”, including the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements, arrangements or
understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the consummation of the merger is a vote separate
and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal
and vote not to approve such compensation and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be
binding on the Company or the Board. As the Company or Parent is contractually obligated to pay such
compensation, such compensation will be paid or become payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto,
if the merger is consummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the advisory compensation proposal.

The Company is seeking the approval by the holders of common stock of the merger, in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement the Company entered into on August 1, 2022 with Parent and
Merger Sub. Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to the satisfaction or (if permissible under applicable
law) waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board has unanimously approved the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and unanimously
recommends that holders of common stock vote to approve the merger proposal.
Background of the Merger
The Company’s management and the Board regularly review the Company’s performance and prospects in light of its
business and developments in the financial services industry and the macroeconomic environment. These reviews
have included consideration, from time to time, of potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions
to enhance stockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such reviews have been accompanied by
periodic conversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in the
financial services industry regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.
On January 19, 2022, Mr. Riaz Ahmed, TD’s President and Chief Executive Officer, TD Securities and Group Head,
Wholesale Banking, contacted Mr. Jeffrey Solomon, the Company’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer, to request a
meeting with Mr. Solomon. An introductory meeting between Mr. Solomon, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Robbie Pryde, TD
Securities’ Executive Vice Chair and Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, took place on March 1, 2022, at
which they discussed their respective businesses. During such conversation, representatives of TD indicated an
interest in expanding TD’s investment banking business in the U.S. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Brett Barth, the
Board’s lead independent director, of the March 1 meeting (and the earlier January call) shortly thereafter.
On March 2, 2022, Mr. Solomon contacted Mr. Ahmed to inform Mr. Ahmed that, following the March 1 meeting and
internal discussions, the Company would be interested in continuing the conversation regarding their respective
businesses and potential opportunities for the Company and TD to consider.
On March 9, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed had a call to continue their conversation regarding their respective
businesses and potential opportunities for the Company and TD to consider.
Also on March 9, 2022, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the securities business of Company A, a global
financial institution, representatives of which had, from time to time, expressed interest in business opportunities with
the Company, contacted a representative of Ardea, a financial advisor to the Company, to inquire, based on Ardea’s
familiarity with the Company, whether Ardea was aware whether the Company might be interested in engaging in a
potential strategic partnership with Company A. The representative of Ardea encouraged the representative of
Company A to contact the Company directly if Company A was interested in pursuing discussions with the
Company. The representative of Company A then contacted Mr. Solomon to schedule a meeting to discuss the
potential for a strategic partnership between the Company and Company A. On March 17, 2022, Mr. Solomon met
with a representative of Company A. During this meeting, Mr. Solomon and the representative of Company A
discussed their respective businesses. Following this meeting, on March 21, 2022, the representative of Company A
contacted Mr. Solomon to request a follow-up meeting with additional members of management of the Company and
of Company A. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the inquiry from Company A, the March 17
meeting, and the March 21 request for a follow-up meeting.
On April 5, 2022, representatives of the Company including Mr. Solomon, Mr. Dan Charney, Managing Director and
Co-President of the Company’s broker-dealer business, and Mr. Larry Wieseneck, Managing Director and Co-
President of the Company’s broker-dealer business, met with Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Pryde. A representative of Perkins
Advisors, LLC, a financial advisor to the Company (which we refer to as “Perkins Advisors”), also attended at the
request of the Company’s management. During this meeting, management of the Company and of TD discussed their
respective businesses, including a potential strategic partnership between TD and the Company.
On April 12, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Stephen Lasota, the Company’s Managing Director and Chief Financial
Officer, met with representatives of Company A to discuss their respective businesses, including the
31TABLE OF CONTENTS
growth of the research, sales and trading and investment banking divisions at Cowen, the alignment of Cowen’s
culture with the culture at TD and the potential for a strategic partnership between Company A and the Company. A
representative of Perkins Advisors also attended at the request of the Company’s management.
During the week of April 18, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed spoke on several occasions, during which Mr.
Ahmed informed Mr. Solomon that TD had enjoyed their prior introductory meeting and wanted to continue
conversations regarding a potential strategic partnership between TD and the Company. Mr. Ahmed proposed a
follow-up meeting between management of the Company and of TD to discuss their respective businesses further,
and Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that he would discuss any further engagement with the Board at its upcoming
meeting.
On April 21, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in person. During executive session, Mr. Solomon
informed the independent directors of the Board (which we refer to collectively as the “Independent Directors”) of
the interest from TD and Company A in exploring potential strategic partnerships with the Company. The Board also
noted that other parties had, from time to time, expressed interest in a potential strategic transaction involving the
Company. After discussion, the Board authorized Mr. Solomon to engage in discussions with TD, Company A and
other parties that express interest regarding their respective interests in and the basic terms of a potential strategic
transaction. The Board instructed Mr. Solomon not to discuss the terms of any proposal relating to compensation or
retention arrangements for members of management until after the Board and a potential acquiror had reached an
agreement on the price per share of common stock of the Company to be paid in a potential strategic transaction.
Later on April 21, 2022, TD sent the Company a draft mutual confidentiality agreement.
On April 22, 2022, the Company and TD entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement which contained a customary
standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a binding written
agreement for the acquisition of the Company by a third party.
On April 28, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with Mr. Ahmed. During this meeting, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed discussed the
potential strategic fit of the Company and TD, including the cultural fit and potential social issues associated with
combining the two organizations and their respective employees. Following this discussion, Mr. Solomon and Mr.
Ahmed agreed to schedule a meeting between the broader management teams of the Company and TD.
On May 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (which we refer to as “Cravath”), outside counsel to the Company,
attending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors on discussions with TD regarding a
potential strategic transaction, noting that TD continued to show interest in a potential transaction involving the
Company and that the Company and TD had scheduled a meeting between their respective management teams to
review management presentations during the following week. Mr. Solomon also noted that the Company’s
management was planning a meeting with Company A in the coming weeks to continue a review of their respective
businesses and to evaluate a potential strategic transaction with Company A. Representatives of Cravath then
reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties and other legal matters. Representatives of the
Company’s management then reviewed with the Board the Company’s existing financial forecasts, including a “base
case” based on the Company’s existing internal plan for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 extended through fiscal year 2026
and a “high case” for the same period reflecting assumptions regarding an improved macroeconomic environment,
increased activity in the Company’s core businesses and accelerated growth in the Company’s growth businesses
(including the Company’s Cowen Digital businesses). Representatives of the Company’s management also reviewed
with the Board the potential impact of certain potential divestitures on the Company’s financial forecasts. The Board
then discussed the Company’s actual results to date during the second quarter of 2022. The Company’s management
noted that, given the adverse macroeconomic environment, including a broader decline in equity markets and deal-
making activity and rising interest rates during the quarter, actual revenue for the fiscal year 2022 across all core
businesses was expected to be lower than the “base case” for fiscal year 2022. After discussion, the Independent
Directors requested management to present its “low case” forecast reflecting the then-current market environment.
Mr. Solomon noted that the Company’s management had prepared such a forecast for budgeting purposes for the
2022 fiscal year but had not previously extended such forecast beyond fiscal year 2022. The Independent Directors
requested that the Company’s management extend such forecast through fiscal year 2026 and present such forecast
at a subsequent Board meeting.

On May 10, 2022, representatives of management of the Company and of TD met to review management
presentations regarding their respective businesses. A representative of Perkins Advisors also attended at the
request of the Company’s management. The Company’s management presentation included the Company’s “Base
Case” and “High Case” financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, as described in the section entitled “The
Merger-Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, which the Independent Directors had
authorized the Company’s management to share with TD upon Mr. Solomon’s request following the May 6 Board
meeting. The Company also provided TD with a summary of “change of control” severance payments that could
potentially become payable to all Company employees entitled to such payments in connection with a qualifying
termination following a “change of control”, which the Company estimated, based on an assumed closing of a
transaction on September 30, 2022, to be equivalent to an aggregate amount of approximately $305 million
(approximately $67 million of which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses). In addition, for all
employees with “change of control” severance agreements, the Company estimated that there would be accelerated
vesting of an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs
and Company PSUs and approximately $17 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards
previously granted in respect of prior years’ compensation (assuming termination of employment for all such
employees without cause in connection with a “change of control” on September 30, 2022). Such amounts included
an estimated aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $294 million of such payments (approximately $65
million of which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses) and accelerated vesting of an aggregate of
approximately 1.5 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs and Company PSUs and an
estimated amount of approximately $17 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards previously
granted in respect of prior years’ compensation. Such amounts included, for Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck
combined, an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $144 million of such payments (approximately $32 million
of which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses) and accelerated vesting of an aggregate of
approximately 0.7 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs and Company PSUs and an
estimated amount of approximately $5.5 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards previously
granted in respect of prior years’ compensation. During this meeting, representatives of the Company’s management
and Perkins Advisors indicated to the representatives of TD that any indication of interest with respect to a potential
transaction involving TD and the Company should be based on the Company’s intrinsic value (also taking into
account the value of the Company’s investment management business and balance sheet investments) and should
not be based on the then-current trading price of the class A common stock, which was $24.30 as of May 9, 2022, the
last trading day before such meeting.
Following this meeting, representatives of TD informed representatives of the Company’s management that TD was
interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company, and that TD would provide an initial indication of the
valuation of such an acquisition by the end of the following week. Representatives of TD also noted that TD would
intend to keep the Company’s management team involved in the business after a potential acquisition though no
terms of compensation, titles or responsibilities of members of the Company’s management team were discussed. Mr.
Solomon informed representatives of TD that, while the Company was not seeking a sale of the Company at that time
and that he did not expect the Board would be willing to pursue a sale of the Company at a valuation based on the
then-current trading price of the class A common stock, which had fallen from $31.86 at the close of trading on
January 19, 2022 (the date TD first contacted the Company to request a meeting) to $23.87 at the close of trading on
May 10, 2022, the Company would evaluate any acquisition proposal with the Board.
On May 11, 2022, the Company sent Company A a draft mutual confidentiality agreement.
Later on May 11, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with Mr. Bharat Masrani, TD’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer,
to further discuss a potential strategic transaction between the Company and TD. Mr. Masrani informed Mr. Solomon
that TD was interested in expanding its broker-dealer business in the U.S., and that TD believed that an acquisition of
Cowen would further that strategy given the Company’s strong business and cultural fit with TD.
On May 12, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Cravath and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent
Directors on the discussions with TD, noting that TD had expressed strong interest in a potential transaction and
that management expected TD to provide an indication of the valuation of a potential acquisition of the Company by
the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
end of the following week. Mr. Solomon also informed the Board that a meeting was being scheduled with Company
A in the coming weeks to facilitate Company A’s continued review of the Company’s business. The Company’s
management then reviewed with the Board updated preliminary financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 through 2026,
including a “low case”, “base case” and “high case” as requested by the Board on May 10, 2022, including key
assumptions underlying each scenario. After discussion of the preliminary financial forecasts, the Board instructed
management to share such preliminary financial forecasts with Ardea and to continue refining such preliminary
financial forecasts. The Board had selected Ardea as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. In selecting Ardea as a financial advisor, the Board also considered Ardea’s substantial
industry knowledge and familiarity with the Company’s businesses. The Independent Directors also discussed with
management whether any parties other than TD and Company A had expressed interest in a potential strategic
transaction involving the Company. Mr. Solomon noted that, while certain other parties had in the past expressed
informal interest in a potential strategic transaction involving the Company, such inquiries had not been recent and
had not led to any substantive discussions. The Independent Directors determined that, given the potential
disruption to the Company’s business of a potential public leak, it was advisable that the Company and its
representatives not contact any other potential counterparties at that time, but for the Company’s management to
continue engaging with TD and Company A and any other party that expressed interest in a potential strategic
transaction involving the Company. The Independent Directors also requested that the Company’s management and
Ardea review with the Independent Directors a list of other potentially interested parties and the likelihood that such
parties would be able to execute a strategic transaction involving the Company at a subsequent meeting of the Board.
On May 16, 2022, the Company and Company A entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement which contained a
customary standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a binding
definitive written agreement for the acquisition of the Company by a third party.
On May 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Cravath and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent
Directors on the discussions with TD and Company A, noting that management continued to expect TD to provide
an indication of the value of a potential acquisition of the Company within the next week, and that management was
continuing to provide information to facilitate diligence to TD and, now that Company A had signed a confidentiality
agreement, Company A. The Board instructed management to continue discussions and continue sharing diligence
information with TD and Company A. The Company’s management then reviewed again with the Board the financial
forecasts reviewed with the Board on May 6, 2022, and also reviewed with the Board updated financial forecasts for
fiscal years 2024 through 2026, including a “Low Case”, “Base Case” and “High Case” for fiscal years 2022 through
2026, which forecasts we refer to collectively as the “Financial Forecasts” and are described in more detail in the
section entitled “The Merger-Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, including key
assumptions underlying each scenario and the Company’s results to date during the second quarter of 2022. A
discussion followed regarding macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets, the impact
of such conditions and markets on the Company’s business and financial prospects and the trading price of the class
A common stock, and the risks associated with remaining a standalone public company in such an environment,
including the potential impact of a downturn on the Company’s profitability and therefore its ability to compensate
and retain employees. The Board also discussed the relative probability of each of the scenarios reflected in the
Financial Forecasts in light of such macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets,
noting that the “High Case” was unlikely to be achieved, but did not assign any formal probabilities at that time. The
Board also discussed the Company’s potential divestiture of certain of the Company’s assets, noting that several
parties had expressed interest in exploring potential transactions involving some or all of such assets, but that the
Company had not received any formal indications of interest for a specific proposal involving such assets. The Board
further noted that the likelihood of executing any such divestitures in the immediate future was low given the
macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets, and therefore that any valuation for the
Company should assume that the Company retains all of its businesses. After discussion, the Board authorized the
Company’s management to share the Financial Forecasts with Ardea and requested that Ardea prepare preliminary
financial analyses for the Company on a standalone basis.
Over the following weeks, both TD and Company A conducted preliminary due diligence, including numerous calls
and meetings with the Company’s management and review of documentary diligence materials,
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
including copies of the Company’s “change of control” severance agreements, summaries of which had been
provided to TD on May 10, 2022. Mr. Solomon and other members of the Company’s senior management and
advisors periodically briefed and received input from the Independent Directors as to the due diligence processes
with TD and Company A.
On May 19, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (which we refer to as “Simpson Thacher”),
outside counsel to TD, contacted representatives of Cravath and communicated that, while TD was considering a
proposal for an acquisition of the Company, TD would not be willing to pursue a transaction without restructuring
and reducing the Company’s existing “change of control” severance obligations that would otherwise become
payable in connection with a transaction. After discussion with Mr. Barth and representatives of the Company’s
management team, representatives of Cravath communicated to representatives of Simpson Thacher a request that
any proposal should include the proposed price to be paid per share of class A common stock in a potential
transaction and, in order for the Board to assess whether any proposal were actionable, TD’s proposal regarding
restructuring or reducing the Company’s “change of control” severance obligations.
On May 26, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Lasota, together with a representative from Perkins Advisors, met with a
representative of Company A to continue a discussion of their respective businesses and a potential strategic
partnership between the two companies, including a review of the Company’s “Base Case” and “High Case”
forecasts for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.
Later on May 26, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon to inform Mr. Solomon that TD’s advisors would be
communicating a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of all of the Company’s outstanding common stock later
that day. Subsequently, a representative of Perella Weinberg Partners (which we refer to as “Perella Weinberg”)
verbally communicated to a representative of Ardea TD’s non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding
common stock for $32.00 in cash per share of common stock (which we refer to as the “May 26 Proposal”), which
proposal represented a 25% premium to the closing trading price for shares of class A common stock of $25.70 on
May 25, 2022, the last trading day prior to the May 26 Proposal. The representative of Perella Weinberg also
communicated that the May 26 Proposal was conditioned upon TD reaching satisfactory arrangements with all
members of the Company’s management team with “change of control” severance agreements (including the
Executives) requiring such members to waive their “good reason” resignation rights and “change of control”
severance protections in connection with the potential transaction in exchange for retention awards that would vest
over a three-year period after the closing of the potential transaction with a face value representing a substantial
reduction compared to the aggregate estimated cash severance payable to such members of management under their
existing contractual severance entitlements (with the proposed discount to such entitlements based primarily on a
reduction of the underlying multiples of prior years’ compensation used to determine the amounts of cash severance
payable from 2.5x of total compensation under the existing contractual arrangements to 1.5x to 2.0x of cash
compensation (i.e., base salary and cash bonus), varying by individual).
Ardea communicated the May 26 Proposal, including the proposed reduction of the aggregate estimated value of the
cash severance payable to members of management, to Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon, as well as representatives of
Cravath and Perkins Advisors. After discussion among Mr. Barth, the Company’s senior management and
representatives of Ardea, Perkins Advisors and Cravath, it was determined that the May 26 Proposal undervalued the
Company and was likely below a valuation that the Board would be willing to consider for a sale of the Company. Mr.
Solomon updated each of the Independent Directors on the May 26 Proposal and informed them that Mr. Solomon
and the Company’s management team recommended ceasing further engagement unless the proposed price of $32.00
in cash per share of common stock reflected in the May 26 Proposal was improved substantially.
On May 30, 2022, a representative of Ardea, acting upon the instructions of the Company, communicated to a
representative of Perella Weinberg that the May 26 Proposal undervalued the Company and that the Company would
not be engaging in any further discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction.
On May 31, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon. Mr. Solomon reiterated that the valuation of the May 26
Proposal did not warrant further discussion. Mr. Ahmed informed Mr. Solomon that TD would conduct further
diligence and valuation analysis prior to submitting a revised proposal. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the
discussion.
During the remainder of the week of May 30, 2022, TD continued due diligence, including due diligence meetings and
calls on June 2, 2022, June 3, 2022 and June 4, 2022 between representatives of management of
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
TD and of the Company to discuss the potential sources of value in the Company’s business outside of the
Company’s core investment banking and broker-dealer franchise (including the value of the Company’s investment
management business and balance sheet investments). Representatives of Perella Weinberg and Perkins Advisors
also participated in the due diligence meetings and calls.
On June 5, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon and verbally communicated to Mr. Solomon TD’s revised non-
binding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock for $39.00 in cash per share of common stock
(which we refer to as the “June 5 Proposal”), which proposal represented a 49% premium to the closing price for
shares of class A common stock of $26.18 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 5 Proposal. The June
5 Proposal contained the same conditionality as the May 26 Proposal, including TD reaching satisfactory
arrangements with each member of the Company’s management team with “change of control” severance agreements.
Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that he would need to discuss the revised proposal with the Board. A
representative of Perella Weinberg also contacted a representative of Ardea and verbally communicated the June 5
Proposal later that day, and noted that the additional due diligence and analysis of the Company’s investment
management business had enabled TD to increase its proposal from the May 26 Proposal.
On June 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Cravath, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon communicated the June 5 Proposal
to the Independent Directors, and Mr. Solomon and representatives of Ardea described to the Independent Directors
their respective conversations with TD and its advisors. The Board then discussed a potential response to the June 5
Proposal, noting that the June 5 Proposal had been communicated verbally and did not include a description of any
contingencies to the proposal or any further details on the May 26 Proposal with respect to retention arrangements
with members of the Company’s senior management team in lieu of “change of control” payments, and that while
Company A was continuing to conduct due diligence, Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest.
Representatives of Ardea noted that Ardea was reviewing the Financial Forecasts with the Company’s management,
including reconciling economic operating income to unlevered free cash flow for purposes of a preliminary valuation
analysis, and that Ardea would prepare preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal for discussion at a
subsequent meeting of the Board. After discussion the Board determined to continue evaluating the June 5 Proposal,
but not to request a written proposal from TD at that time. The Board then discussed whether any other third party
may be interested in an acquisition of the Company, including Ardea’s views on potential bidders based on Ardea’s
knowledge of the industry and information from management on third parties that had previously expressed interest
in partnerships or other strategic transactions involving the Company. After discussion, the Board determined that
there was a limited number of counterparties that may be interested in and able to execute an acquisition of the
Company, and that given the risk of a leak and the potential damage to the Company’s business and employee
retention in the event of a leak, it was advisable to continue discussions with TD and Company A but not to contact
other parties regarding a potential transaction at that time. The Board then instructed the Company’s management
and advisors to continue discussions with, and request an indication of interest from, Company A. The members of
Company management then informed the Board that it was also evaluating the implementation of potential cost
cutting measures in light of the then-current economic environment and its impact on the Company’s performance,
but that management would defer any decision on such implementation until the conclusion of the ongoing
discussions with third parties regarding a partnership or other strategic transaction involving the Company. The
members of Company management, Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent
Directors commenced an executive session with representatives of Cravath participating. The Independent Directors
further discussed a potential response to the June 5 Proposal, noting that the proposal represented a substantial
increase of over 20% from the May 26 Proposal, that, during that same period, the Company’s financial performance
had continued to be impacted by downward trends in the financial markets, and the risks associated with remaining a
standalone public company in such an environment, including the potential impact of a downturn on the Company’s
profitability and therefore its ability to compensate and retain employees. The Independent Directors also noted that
the May 26 Proposal and June 5 Proposal were conditioned upon TD reaching satisfactory arrangements with certain
members of the Company’s senior management related to the “change of control” severance entitlements, that there
was a risk that TD would not be able to reach an agreement with all requisite members of the Company’s senior
management, and that it was unlikely that TD or any other potential bidder that was expecting to retain the
Company’s senior management team after an acquisition of the Company would be willing to pursue a transaction
without reaching an agreement on retention

arrangements given the relative size of the “change of control” severance entitlements compared to the Company’s
then-current market capitalization. The Independent Directors discussed that the Independent Directors should
continue to direct the process, and that, while the Company’s management should not discuss the terms of any
proposal relating to compensation or retention with potential counterparties to a transaction at that time, the
Company’s management itself was a key asset of the Company and such discussions would need to occur at a later
date when authorized by the Independent Directors in order to facilitate a transaction.
On June 7, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon to discuss the status of the Board’s evaluation of the June 5
Proposal. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that the Board was evaluating the June 5 Proposal with its financial
advisors and that the Company would respond once that evaluation was complete.
On June 8, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher contacted representatives of Cravath to discuss the status of
the Board’s evaluation of the June 5 Proposal. Representatives of Cravath informed the representatives of Simpson
Thacher that the Board was evaluating the June 5 Proposal with its financial advisors and that the Company would
respond once that evaluation was complete, and that the Board did not have a fixed timeline for that evaluation.
Also on June 8, 2022, representatives of management of Company A and of the Company held a diligence call to
discuss the potential sources of value in the Company’s business outside of the Company’s core investment banking
and broker-dealer franchise (including the value of the Company’s investment management business and balance
sheet investments). Representatives of Perkins Advisors also participated in that meeting. During this meeting,
representatives of the Company’s management and Perkins Advisors indicated to the representatives of Company A
that any indication of interest should reflect the net consideration payable to the holders of common stock based on
the Company’s intrinsic value (also taking into account the value of these businesses and investments) and should
not be based on the then-current trading price of the class A common stock, which was $25.04 as of June 9, 2022, the
last trading day before such meeting.
Later on June 8, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s
management and representatives of Cravath, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Barth opened the meeting
by noting that, because the Financial Forecasts included the “Low Case”, “Base Case” and “High Case”, Ardea had
requested that the Independent Directors provide instructions to Ardea regarding which of such scenarios to utilize
for purposes of Ardea’s preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal and the relative weighting of such
scenarios. Mr. Barth then requested that the Company’s management provide an update to the Independent Directors
on the Company’s performance to date in the second quarter and near-term and long-term outlook. Mr. Solomon, Mr.
Charney and Mr. Wieseneck then provided an update on the Company’s financial performance, noting revenue
declines in the Company’s core businesses as compared to the annual budget as a result of reduced mergers &
acquisitions and capital markets activity in the second quarter, particularly in industries such as biotechnology and
special purpose acquisition vehicles in which the Company was active, as well as an expected decline in incentive
fees for the Company’s investment management business as a result of declining asset values. Mr. Solomon noted
that, while the macroeconomic outlook was difficult to predict, if the then-current business trends continued through
the remainder of 2022, the Company’s performance would likely be below the Low Case Financial Forecasts and,
absent a partnership or other strategic transaction involving the Company, that management would look to implement
cost cutting measures to counteract the impact of such trends on the Company’s performance. The Board also
requested Ardea’s views on the Financial Forecasts compared to updated Wall Street equity research analyst
consensus estimates for the Company’s future earnings. Representatives of Ardea noted that at that point in time,
Wall Street equity research analyst consensus estimates for the Company’s future earnings for fiscal years 2022 and
2023 were approximately half-way between the Low Case and the Base Case Financial Forecasts, but that not all
analysts that covered the Company had updated their published forecasts recently and that such forecasts may
decline further following the Company’s second quarter earnings announcement. The Board then discussed the
weighting of the Financial Forecasts for purposes of Ardea’s preliminary financial analyses, noting that while the
Company’s performance was difficult to project over the long term given volatility in the financial markets, based on
then-current trends, the Low Case was the most likely of the scenarios reflected in the Financial Forecasts to occur.
After discussion, the Independent Directors unanimously instructed Ardea to assign a probability weighting of 55%
to the Low Case, 35% to the Base Case and 10% to the High Case in performing its financial analyses (which we refer
to as the “Weightings”). The Independent Directors also instructed Ardea to assume, for purposes of its preliminary
financial analyses, that the Company would remain a standalone public company and maintain the status quo for its
business mix (without
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
executing any divestitures of any of the Company’s assets), given the uncertainty in asset prices and the fact that the
Company had commenced a divestiture process for certain assets but had not yet received any formal indications of
interest for a specific proposal involving such assets. Mr. Solomon and representatives of Cravath informed the
Independent Directors of the outreach from TD and Simpson Thacher regarding the timing of the Board’s evaluation.
The Board determined that it would convene a subsequent meeting once Ardea had prepared preliminary financial
analyses based on the instructions provided by the Independent Directors prior to responding to TD. The
Company’s management also provided an update on the status of Company A’s ongoing due diligence, and the
Board instructed the Company’s management to continue facilitating such due diligence.
On June 10, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with representatives of Company A, including the Chief Executive Officer of
Company A’s U.S. business, to discuss the potential strategic and cultural fit of their respective businesses.
On June 12, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (which we refer to as “Morris Nichols”),
outside Delaware counsel to the Company, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Ardea provided an overview of
their preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal based on the Financial Forecasts and the Weightings.
Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board draft process guidelines that had been circulated to the
Board in advance of the meeting, which reiterated instructions that the Company’s management should not discuss
the terms of any proposal relating to compensation or retention with potential counterparties to a transaction until
specifically authorized to do so by the Independent Directors, and stated that the Independent Directors would direct
the process and have ultimate decision-making authority with respect to all questions arising from such process. The
guidelines also specified that at least one representative of Ardea should be included in any substantive
communications with potential counterparties to a transaction on behalf of the Company, and that all such
communications should be promptly reported to the Independent Directors.
After discussion, the Board adopted such guidelines. Mr. Solomon noted to the Board that, while management did
not intend to negotiate compensation or retention arrangements with TD or other potential counterparties until
specifically authorized to do so by the Board, Mr. Solomon expected, based on preliminary discussions with
individual members of the Company’s senior management team, that the retention arrangements communicated
verbally in the May 26 Proposal would be inadequate to retain all desired members of the Company’s management
and that TD would likely need to improve the value and vesting terms of such retention arrangements if TD’s
proposals continued to be contingent on such arrangements. Mr. Solomon then provided the Board with an update
on discussions with TD and Company A, noting that TD was awaiting a response to the June 5 Proposal and that
Company A had continued to show interest in a potential transaction, including hiring a financial advisor and
engaging members of senior management in meetings with the Company. After discussion, the members of Company
management exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with
representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Independent Directors
discussed the June 5 Proposal and potential responses to TD, including that TD had already materially increased its
proposal by over 20% between the May 26 Proposal and the June 5 Proposal despite a continuing decline in broader
financial markets, and whether TD would be willing to further improve the price of its proposal above $39.00 per
share. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to communicate to Perella
Weinberg that the $39.00 per share of common stock proposed in the June 5 Proposal was insufficient, and that TD
should submit an improved proposal in writing, which should also include details on any contingencies relating to
retention arrangements with members of the Company’s management and the proposed terms of such retention
arrangements so that the Board could assess whether a transaction would be achievable on the terms proposed. The
Independent Directors authorized Ardea and Perkins Advisors to communicate to TD that the Board expected a
valuation of at least $42.00 per share of common stock, which would represent an increase of $10.00 per share from
the May 26 Proposal. The Independent Directors also instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to continue
engagement with Company A, and to encourage Company A to submit an indication of interest by the end of the
week of June 13, 2022. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and the Independent
Directors continued an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols attending. The
Independent Directors then discussed the formal retention of Ardea as a financial advisor to the Company, noting
that Ardea had provided disclosure to the Board confirming that Ardea did not have any material business
relationships with TD, Company A or other potentially interested parties. After discussion, the Independent
Directors determined that it was advisable to continue with negotiating the terms of Ardea’s engagement. The
Independent Directors also discussed the formal retention of Perkins Advisors as a financial advisor to the Company,
noting that Perkins Advisors had substantial industry knowledge and familiarity with Cowen’s businesses, including
a long-standing relationship with the Company and its management. After discussion, the
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Independent Directors determined that it was advisable to formally engage Perkins Advisors in connection with the
transaction, subject to compliance with the process guidelines discussed earlier in the meeting. The Independent
Directors also reaffirmed the proposed response to TD that had been discussed with Ardea and Perkins Advisors.
Later on June 12, 2022, at the instruction of the Independent Directors, representatives of Ardea and Perkins
Advisors contacted representatives of Perella Weinberg and communicated that the $39.00 per share of common
stock proposed in the June 5 Proposal was insufficient and that the Board had requested an improved proposal in
writing. The representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors also noted that the Board expected a valuation of at least
$42.00 per share of common stock in order for the Board to be willing to approve a transaction at that time, and
expected that a written proposal would contain details on any contingencies relating to retention arrangements with
members of the Company’s management and the proposed terms of such retention arrangements. Representatives of
Perella Weinberg responded that they were disappointed with the response but would update TD.
On June 13, 2022, Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon spoke with Mr. Ahmed to reiterate the message communicated by
Ardea and Perkins Advisors and request an improved proposal in writing.
Also on June 13, 2022, at the instruction of the Independent Directors, representatives of Ardea and Perkins
Advisors contacted representatives of Company A and encouraged Company A to submit an indication of interest
by the end of the week of June 13, 2022. Representatives of Company A subsequently responded that Company A
would need at least 10 days to formulate an indication of interest with a proposed valuation for an acquisition of the
outstanding common stock of the Company.
On June 14, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with a representative of Company A, during which the representative of Company
A conducted further diligence on the Company’s business and the potential strategic rationale for an acquisition of
the Company and discussed potential social issues arising from such a combination, including the potential
integration of the Company into Company A’s existing business lines and potential roles for the Company’s
management team, with some business lines potentially led by current employees of the Company and some business
lines led by existing employees of Company A. No financial terms of a potential transaction or proposed terms for
retention arrangements regarding Company management were discussed.
On June 15, 2022, representatives of TD sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100%
of the Company’s common stock for $39.00 in cash (which we refer to as the “June 15 Proposal”). The June 15
Proposal was expressly conditioned upon all members of the Company’s management team with “change of control”
severance agreements (including the Executives) waiving their rights under such existing agreements and entering
into new retention arrangements with TD on terms set forth in the June 15 Proposal. With respect to the Executives,
the terms of such arrangements set forth in the June 15 Proposal included, among others, (i) the grant of a retention
award to each Executive, which the Company estimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives,
of approximately $120 million, with 25% of each such award payable in cash at the closing of the potential transaction
and 75% of each such award to be granted in the form of restricted share units in TD common stock vesting in equal
installments on each of the first three anniversaries of such closing, and (ii) the payment of a pro rata bonus to each
Executive for the year of such closing based on actual performance of the Company through the date of such closing
(rather than based on the average annual bonus of such Executive for the two years immediately preceding the year
of employment termination, as provided in the existing “change of control” severance agreement of such Executive),
which the Company estimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $23
million, assuming such closing occurred by the end of calendar year 2022. The Company estimated the foregoing
awards and payments to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $143 million. In
addition, in its June 15 Proposal, TD proposed the restructuring of all Executives’ unvested Company compensation
awards to extend the existing vesting schedule of such awards so as to vest in equal installments on each of the first
three anniversaries of such closing (to the extent such restructuring would be permitted pursuant to applicable tax
laws). The June 15 Proposal was also conditioned upon completion of due diligence and also included a draft
exclusivity agreement that would require the Company to terminate negotiations with any other party regarding a
potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with TD for a period of four weeks from the date of the exclusivity
agreement. The June 15 Proposal purported to expire on June 19, 2022, unless the Company and TD had entered into
such exclusivity agreement by such date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 16, 2022, representatives of Perella Weinberg and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors had a call
to discuss the June 15 Proposal. The representatives of Perella Weinberg communicated that TD was not willing to
increase the proposed acquisition price above $39.00 per share previously communicated in the June 5 Proposal. The
representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors indicated that they would discuss the June 15 Proposal with the
Board.
Also on June 16, 2022, representatives of Company A spoke with a representative of Perkins Advisors and
communicated that Company A was working to submit an indication of interest for an acquisition of all of the
outstanding common stock of the Company during the week of June 20. A representative of Company A also
communicated that Company A had analyzed potential integration plans and envisioned roles for Mr. Solomon, Mr.
Charney and Mr. Wieseneck in the combined organization. The representative of Perkins Advisors encouraged the
representatives of Company A to submit its proposal as promptly as possible.
Later on June 16, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s
management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.
Representatives of Ardea provided an overview of the June 15 Proposal and reviewed their preliminary financial
analyses of the June 15 Proposal. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the members of the Board their
fiduciary duties and other legal matters. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then provided an update to
the Board on their recent discussions with Perella Weinberg and with representatives of Company A. The Board then
discussed the June 15 Proposal, noting that TD had been unwilling to increase the proposed price per share of
common stock beyond $39.00 per share, but that TD had maintained such proposed price per share despite a broader
decline in equity markets and an approximate 13% decline in the trading price of the class A common stock from
$26.18 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 5 Proposal, to $22.88 on June 15, 2022. After discussion,
the Independent Directors determined that while $39.00 per share of common stock represented compelling value for
the Company, particularly in light of the market environment, TD had not increased its proposal from the June 5
Proposal and the Independent Directors were not willing to grant exclusivity, which could have precluded a
competing proposal from Company A or any other interested party, at such valuation. After discussion regarding a
potential response and counter-proposal to TD, the Board determined that it would convene a subsequent meeting
the next day to continue discussion of a response to the June 15 Proposal.
On June 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Board continued
discussions regarding the June 15 Proposal, including the fact that the June 15 Proposal was conditioned upon all
members of the Company’s senior management team with “change of control” severance agreements waiving their
rights under their existing “change of control” severance agreements and entering into retention arrangements
representing a reduction in value as compared to such agreements, and that there was no guarantee that all members
of the Company’s senior management team would be willing to do so absent agreement on roles and responsibilities
with TD. Mr. Solomon noted that while he expected that there would be a negotiation among members of the
Company’s senior management team and TD regarding the proposed retention arrangements if and when the
Independent Directors authorized management to engage in such negotiations, he expected that satisfactory
arrangements could be reached because the requisite members of the Company’s senior management team had
expressed to Mr. Solomon that they would be willing to negotiate compensation arrangements that had a lower value
than their existing “change of control” severance entitlements if so required in connection with a transaction. The
members of Company management and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors
commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Ardea participating. In
executive session, the Independent Directors discussed a potential response to the June 15 Proposal. After
discussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate to TD that, while the June 15 Proposal was
insufficient to warrant exclusivity, the Board would be willing to engage in further discussions and to authorize
members of the Company’s management to engage in discussions with TD regarding post-closing employment and
compensation arrangements if TD increased its proposal to $41.00 per share, and that the Board would be willing to
consider exclusivity only after TD had increased its proposal to $41.00 per share and satisfied the other conditions to
the June 15 Proposal, including completion of TD’s substantive due diligence and agreement on satisfactory
retention arrangements with members of the Company’s management. The Independent Directors also discussed
potential communications to Company A in order to cause Company A to provide an indication of interest on an
accelerated timeframe, and instructed Ardea to communicate to Company A that any indication of interest needed to
be delivered to the Company by the close
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of business on June 22, 2022. Representatives of Ardea then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors
continued the executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent
Directors discussed the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and broader financial markets
reflected in the Company’s then-current stock price, which had declined to a 52-week low of $21.36 on June 16, 2022,
and noted that the Independent Directors shared the Company management’s continuing concern for the Company’s
business outlook if that environment continued.
On June 17, 2022, following the Board meeting, representatives of Ardea communicated the Independent Directors’
position to representatives of Perella Weinberg. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Perella Weinberg contacted
representatives of Ardea and communicated that TD was unwilling to increase its proposal above $39.00 per share of
common stock given the continued decline in equity market conditions since TD had first communicated a proposal
of $39.00 per share of common stock on June 5, 2022. Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon also contacted Mr. Ahmed to
communicate the Independent Directors’ position to Mr. Ahmed directly, and Mr. Ahmed reiterated that TD was
unwilling to increase its proposal above $39.00 per share of common stock given market conditions and the impact of
market conditions on the Company’s recent performance and short-term outlook.
Also on June 17, 2022, representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors contacted representatives of Company A’s
financial advisor and indicated that the Company’s timetable for evaluating alternatives had shifted and requested
that Company A submit an indication of interest by the close of business on June 22, 2022. Representatives of
Company A’s financial advisor responded that, based on internal scheduling, it was unlikely that Company A would
be in a position to submit an indication of interest on such timetable. Subsequent to that discussion, a representative
of Company A contacted a representative of Perkins Advisors to discuss the timetable, and indicated that Company
A would endeavor to submit an indication of interest promptly. The representative of Company A also indicated that
Company A would like to discuss “change of control” severance arrangements with members of the Company’s
management. The representative of Perkins Advisors replied that the Independent Directors would not authorize the
Company’s management to engage in such discussions until the Board had received a proposal for the value that
Company A was prepared to offer to the holders of common stock and the Board had evaluated such proposal.
Later on June 17, 2022, the Board reconvened a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s
management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Barth
and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors provided updates to the Board on discussions with
representatives of TD and Company A after the earlier Board meeting. The Board then discussed proposed
responses and communications to each of TD and Company A. The Board noted that the Company had already
requested that TD improve its proposal on three occasions, and on each occasion TD had reverted with a proposal of
$39.00 per share of common stock and had repeatedly expressed an unwillingness to improve such proposal. The
Board also noted that while Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest, Company A continued to
express strong interest in a potential acquisition of the Company and, given similarities in the Company’s and
Company A’s respective businesses, Company A may be able to achieve greater cost synergies (but lower revenue
synergies) than TD in a potential transaction. After discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the value
reflected in the June 15 Proposal compared to the Company’s prospects as a standalone public company, including
the risks of operating in any prolonged market downturn, it was advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders to pursue further discussions with TD on the basis of the June 15 Proposal, but that the Board
was not willing to grant exclusivity to TD, given that TD had not improved its proposal above $39.00 per share of
common stock and that Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest. The members of Company
management and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive
session with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Ardea participating. The Independent Directors noted
that while the Board was willing to pursue further discussions with TD on the basis of the June 15 Proposal, the June
15 Proposal was not actionable absent an agreement between TD and members of the Company’s management
regarding retention arrangements. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized management to begin
discussions with TD regarding post-closing compensation and retention arrangements, subject to guidelines for the
conduct of such discussions to be prepared by Cravath and adopted by the Independent Directors, including
requirements that members of the Company’s management keep the Independent Directors apprised of any material
developments with respect to such discussions, that management not finalize any arrangements with TD or
memorialize any arrangements in definitive written agreements until the Independent Directors had authorized
management to do so, that management continue interacting with other interested counterparties where directed by
the Independent Directors and that members of management retain separate legal counsel in their individual
capacities to represent members of management in negotiations of any
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
compensation or retention arrangements with TD. The Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate this
authorization to Perella Weinberg, and Cravath to communicate these guidelines to the Company’s management team.
Representatives of Ardea then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors continued the executive session,
with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent Directors discussed the
difficulties associated with retaining management and key employees in a prolonged downturn, and the importance to
a potential transaction with TD that TD reach agreement with the Company’s management on satisfactory retention
arrangements.
Following the Board meeting, representatives of Ardea communicated the Board’s response to representatives of
Perella Weinberg, and Mr. Solomon, acting upon the authorization of the Independent Directors, contacted Mr.
Ahmed to inform Mr. Ahmed that management had been authorized to begin discussing compensation or retention
arrangements with TD.
Beginning on June 18, 2022, Mr. Solomon held numerous meetings and conversations with Mr. Ahmed over the
following weeks, with other representatives of management of TD and the Company participating in certain
discussions, to discuss a variety of topics related to compensation and retention, including potential management
structure and reporting lines following a potential transaction, TD’s proposed retention arrangements and post-
closing compensation arrangements for the Company’s senior management team (including whether such
compensation would be guaranteed or based on target bonus levels) and the companies’ respective compensation
philosophies for other employees. These discussions spanned numerous topics regarding elements of the post-
closing compensation structure for non-management employees of the Company, Company management’s role in
determining compensation for Company employees post-closing and assurances that could be communicated to the
Company’s employees prior to closing a potential transaction in order to ensure that the Company would be able to
continue to recruit and retain key employees prior to closing. Mr. Solomon regularly updated Cravath and the
Independent Directors on these discussions.
During this period, the Company also continued discussions with Company A regarding a potential transaction and
continued providing due diligence information to Company A, and on June 20, 2022, Mr. Barth had a conversation
with a representative of Company A to discuss the status of Company A’s evaluation and to reiterate that Company
A would need to submit a proposal promptly in order for the Board to consider such proposal.
On June 22, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the
Company’s common stock based on an aggregate purchase of $1.45 billion, subject to reduction based on (i) any
“change of control” payments or similar entitlements of the Company’s management and employees, (ii) any future
guaranteed payments by Company A to retain identified existing Company personnel and (iii) the principal payment
of the preferred stock (which we refer to as the “June 22 Company A Proposal”). The June 22 Company A Proposal
was also subject to due diligence, and requested that the Company terminate negotiations with any other party
regarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company A for a period of 60 days from the date of
the Company’s acceptance of the Proposal. The June 22 Company A Proposal was also subject to various regulatory
approvals, including anticipated approvals required from the Federal Reserve Board and international banking
regulators.
Following receipt of the June 22 Company A Proposal, representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors contacted
representatives of Company A’s financial advisor to discuss the June 22 Company A Proposal, and indicated that,
while the June 22 Company A Proposal did not attempt to quantify the potential adjustments to the purchase price or
the net consideration to the holders of common stock, based on the Company’s fully diluted share count and existing
“change of control” severance arrangements, Ardea estimated the net price to holders of common stock to be
approximately $30 to $32 per share of common stock, which representatives of Company A’s financial advisor
signaled agreement with. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors indicated that they would discuss the
proposal with the Board, but indicated disappointment with both the valuation and the fact that, despite the
Company’s prior requests, the June 22 Company A Proposal was not based on the net consideration payable to the
holders of common stock.
On or about June 23, 2022, the Executives responded to TD with a counterproposal to the terms of the proposed new
retention arrangements included in the June 15 Proposal, the terms of which included, among others, (i) the payment
of the retention awards included in the June 15 Proposal in cash in equal installments on each of the first three
anniversaries of the closing of a potential transaction in lieu of the restricted share units in TD common stock
included in the June 15 Proposal, which the Company estimated to be equivalent to an
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $183 million, and (ii) the payment of a pro rata bonus to each
Executive for the year of such closing in an amount equal to 80% of such Executive’s pro rata bonus entitlement
under such Executive’s existing “change of control” severance agreements, which the Company estimated to be
equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $52 million, assuming such closing occurred
on September 30, 2022. The Company estimated the foregoing awards and payments to be equivalent to an aggregate
amount, for all Executives, of approximately $235 million. In addition, the Executives proposed that the Executives’
unvested Company compensation awards would not be restructured and would continue to vest on their original
vesting schedule.
On June 24, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of Ardea
reviewed the economic terms of the June 22 Company A Proposal and provided an overview of their discussion with
Company A’s financial advisor. After discussion, the Board determined that, given the valuation and uncertainty
associated with the June 22 Company A Proposal, the June 22 Company A Proposal was insufficient in its current
form. Mr. Solomon then provided an update to the Independent Directors on the status of negotiations between
members of management and TD regarding compensation matters, noting that while progress had been made on the
individual retention arrangements for members of management and TD, no agreement had yet been reached on such
arrangements between the Executives and TD and discussions were also ongoing regarding post-closing
compensation structures for the remaining employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention
of employees prior to closing the potential transaction. The Board then discussed whether, in light of the June 22
Company A Proposal, it was advisable to contact any other potential counterparties to assess interest in a potential
transaction with the Company. The Board discussed that, while a limited number of potential counterparties may be
interested in a transaction involving the Company, making such outreach would increase the risk of a potential public
leak, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, and that certain counterparties may attempt
to recruit the Company’s key employees in the event of a leak. The members of Company management then exited the
meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris
Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Independent Directors discussed a potential response to the
June 22 Company A Proposal. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate to
Company A that the June 22 Company A Proposal was insufficient, that any revised proposal should be based solely
on the net price per share payable to the holders of common stock, and Company A’s proposed price per share of
common stock would need to be at or above $40.00; otherwise Company A would risk losing the opportunity for a
transaction involving the Company. The representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and
the Independent Directors continued the executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols
participating. After discussion among the Independent Directors and representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols,
the Independent Directors determined that it was advisable, given the risk of a potential leak and the potential impact
of a leak on the organization (including employee retention), for the Company to continue discussions with TD and
Company A but not to contact any other potential counterparties at that time. Following the meeting, representatives
of Ardea and Perkins Advisors communicated the Board’s response to Company A.
On June 27, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Mr. Barth to discuss the Board’s response to the June 22
Company A Proposal. The representative of Company A reiterated Company A’s interest in a strategic transaction
involving the Company and noted that Company A had accelerated its evaluation of a potential transaction based on
guidance from the Company. Mr. Barth confirmed that while the Board was appreciative of Company A’s interest, the
structure of the June 22 Company A Proposal was problematic and that in order to properly evaluate a proposal, the
Board would need an indication of value, net to the holders of common stock. The representative of Company A
noted that the Company’s existing “change of control” severance obligations made it difficult to provide certainty of
value. In response, Mr. Barth explained that Company A would be permitted to separately negotiate retention
arrangements with members of management with “change of control” severance agreements, but that the
Independent Directors and Company A would need to reach an agreement on the price per share of common stock
first. The representative of Company A highlighted that Company A would not pay the full value of the Company’s
existing “change of control” severance obligations and would propose to pay management significantly lower
amounts in respect of retention, or else to forgo retention awards entirely and have management remain in their
current roles with the Company after the consummation of a potential transaction. Mr. Barth reiterated that this was
for the Company’s management to negotiate with Company A if Company A and the Independent Directors first
reached an agreement on price. The representative of Company A and Mr. Barth also discussed the overall valuation
of the June
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
22 Company A Proposal, with Mr. Barth reiterating that the Independent Directors had requested that any revised
proposal include a price per share of common stock at or above $40.00. The representative of Company A replied that
Company A did not have an ability to pay a price anywhere in the vicinity of $40.00 per share of common stock.
During the week of June 25, 2022, representatives of management of the Company and TD continued discussions
regarding due diligence and compensation matters, including providing TD and its advisors with access to the
Company’s full data room and discussing compensation structures for the combined organization following a
potential transaction and retention arrangements for the Executives.
On June 30, 2022, the Executives and TD reached a preliminary agreement in principle on retention arrangements, the
terms of which included, among others, (i) the grant of a retention award to each Executive, which the Company
estimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $129 million, with one-third of
each such award payable in cash at the closing of the potential transaction and two-thirds of each such award to be
granted in the form of deferred cash awards vesting in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of
such closing, (ii) the grant of integration awards in the form of cash awards to certain Executives that cliff vest on the
third anniversary of such closing in an aggregate amount for all such Executives of $18 million and (iii) flexibility
under the interim operating covenants of the proposed merger agreement for the Company to determine and allocate
employee bonuses (including for the Executives) for calendar year 2022 based on compensation principles that are
consistent with the Company’s past practices. The Company estimated the foregoing awards and payments to be
equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $147 million exclusive of (i) any annual
bonuses for calendar year 2022 that the Executives may be allocated by the Company and (ii) severance entitlements
in an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $22 million payable only in the event of a qualifying
termination by TD within the first half of the first fiscal year of such closing. The Executives and TD also agreed to
the restructuring of certain unvested Company compensation awards to extend the existing vesting schedule of such
awards so as to vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of such closing (to the extent such
restructuring would be permitted pursuant to applicable tax laws) and to entitlements to severance benefits upon a
qualifying termination pursuant to a formula to be set forth in the employment agreements between the Executives
and TD based on the year of termination and under TD’s general severance policy applicable to similarly situated
employees. No new employment agreements were contemplated for any other employees of the Company. For a
detailed discussion of the material terms of the Executives’ employment arrangements, including severance and
retention entitlements, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement.
Also on June 30, 2022, TD communicated to representatives of the Company that Simpson Thacher would be sending
drafts of a merger agreement and employment agreements to Cravath, and members of management retained
employment counsel to represent members of management in their individual capacities in the review and negotiation
of such employment agreements.
On June 30, 2022, a representative of Company A’s financial advisor contacted a representative of Ardea and
informed the representative of Ardea that Company A was continuing its analysis of a potential transaction and
expected that it may submit a revised proposal by July 5, 2022, which may include a range in “the high $30s” per
share of common stock. The representative of Ardea reiterated the Board’s request that any revised proposal include
a price per share of common stock at or above $40.00. Later that day, a representative of Company A contacted a
representative of Perkins Advisors to communicate the same message, and suggested that Company A was internally
evaluating a proposal with a price per share of common stock at or above $40.00.
Also on June 30, 2022, a representative of a financial advisor (which we refer to as “Financial Advisor X”), contacted
Mr. Solomon to indicate that Financial Advisor X was meeting with an undisclosed potential client that may be
interested in a transaction with the Company. Mr. Solomon acknowledged but did not comment on the information
provided by Financial Advisor X. Later on June 30, 2022, Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the inquiry from
Financial Advisor X.
On July 1, 2022, after the close of trading, Bloomberg News reported a rumor that TD was exploring an acquisition of
the Company, although no decision had been made.
Later on July 1, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of
Cravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed termination fee, which would be payable by the
Company upon the occurrence of certain events, including the Company’s termination of the merger agreement
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to accept a superior proposal (which we refer to as a “company termination fee”), of 4.0% of the equity value of the
potential transaction. The draft also included an indication that TD would expect TD’s obligations to close the merger
to be conditioned on the receipt of certain client consents (and “key person” provisions not being triggered) in
connection with the Company’s investment management and advisory businesses, and limited TD’s obligations to
take or agree to conditions or restrictions in connection with obtaining consents or approvals required in connection
with the merger to those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be expected
to have a material and adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TD and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (with TD deemed to be the same size as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).
On July 2, 2022, members of the Company’s senior management met virtually with Mr. Ahmed and a senior Human
Resources professional from TD to further discuss TD’s compensation programs as well as the Company’s
compensation practices. The executives agreed that they would seek to structure compensation programs for non-
executive employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention of employees prior to closing the
potential transaction. Later that day, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the
Company’s management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.
Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Board on discussions with TD, noting that while there had been some
challenges with respect to discussions regarding compensation policies, talks had progressed and management was
expecting to receive individual employment agreements from TD shortly, and that Simpson Thacher had provided an
initial draft of the merger agreement to Cravath, which Cravath was reviewing. In light of the public reports regarding
a potential transaction with TD the prior day, Mr. Solomon also provided the Board with an overview of the other
inquiries that he or the Company’s advisors had received. Mr. Solomon noted that the Chief Executive Officer of
Company B, an independent U.S. investment bank, had tried to contact and left a voicemail for Mr. Solomon on June
15, 2022 to informally inquire whether he and Mr. Solomon should have a routine dinner but that, to Mr. Solomon’s
knowledge, such inquiry was not in relation to any particular strategic transaction. Company B had previously been
discussed by the Board as a potentially interested counterparty. The Board then discussed the inbound call from
Financial Advisor X on June 30, and Mr. Solomon noted that, as of the time of the Board meeting, Financial Advisor
X had not yet identified its potential client. After discussion, the Board instructed Mr. Solomon to engage with
Company B and any other potential counterparties that expressed interest, but that the Company should not confirm
to any competitor of the Company that it was engaged in discussions regarding a potential acquisition unless such
competitor has expressed a bona fide interest in making an acquisition proposal. Representatives of Ardea and
Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors continued the executive session, with
representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent Directors discussed potential
reactions to a proposal from Company A. The Independent Directors also discussed that, prior to the Bloomberg
News report on July 1, 2022, the Company was expecting to receive preliminary indications of interest in the coming
weeks in connection with the Company’s ongoing asset divestiture processes, but that the Board did not believe it
was likely that the Company would receive an attractive proposal in the then-current macroeconomic environment,
particularly in light of the uncertainty as to the Company’s future given market rumors.
On July 4, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the
Company’s common stock for $40.00 in cash (which we refer to as the “July 4 Company A Proposal”). The July 4
Company A Proposal was subject to due diligence, which the letter indicated Company A expected to complete within
60 days of the Company’s countersignature of the letter, and requested that the Company terminate negotiations with
any other party regarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company A for a period of 60 days.
The July 4 Company A Proposal was also subject to various regulatory approvals, including anticipated approvals
required from the Federal Reserve Board and international banking regulators. Additionally, the July 4 Company A
Proposal noted that Company A expected to discuss with management retention payments and contractual payments
in lieu of existing “change of control” severance entitlements, and proposed that Company A would spend the initial
five business days following countersignature of the letter by the Company working with the Company’s
management team to agree to an aggregate retention pool for existing non-executive employees as well as mutually
agreed contractual arrangements with the seven members of the Company’s senior management team with existing
“change of control” severance agreements.
On July 5, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of the capital markets business of Company C, an international bank with
a U.S. investment banking business, contacted Mr. Solomon, and indicated that while Company C had not been
previously considering a transaction with the Company, Company C would consider evaluating a transaction with the
Company if the Company were interested and inquired whether Company C should pursue
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that opportunity imminently. Mr. Solomon informed the Chief Executive Officer of Company C that, given the press
reports, the Company was receiving interest and if Company C wanted to pursue a transaction time was of the
essence, and that Company C could contact Ardea to discuss.
On July 5, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of Ardea
and Cravath reviewed the terms of the July 4 Company A Proposal. The Board discussed the terms of the July 4
Company A Proposal, noting that the proposal offered a higher notional value per share of common stock than the
$39.00 reflected in the June 15 Proposal, but that the July 4 Company A Proposal was subject to due diligence and
contingent upon reaching an agreement with members of the Company’s management regarding retention
arrangements and did not include any proposal for such retention arrangements. The Board also noted Company A
had requested a substantially longer period than TD to complete its due diligence and that Company A’s proposal
included additional regulatory conditions (including anticipated approvals required from the Federal Reserve Board
and international banking regulators). After discussion, the Board determined that it was advisable for the Company
to reject Company A’s request for exclusivity and to continue discussions and facilitating due diligence with each of
TD and Company A, so that each party could complete its due diligence and satisfy any remaining conditions to its
proposal as quickly as possible. The Independent Directors instructed the Company’s management and advisors to
grant Company A access to the Company’s full data room and to share a draft merger agreement with Company A
simultaneously with sharing a revised draft with TD. The Independent Directors also authorized management to
begin discussions with Company A regarding post-closing compensation and retention arrangements, subject to
guidelines to be prepared by Cravath and adopted by the Independent Directors consistent with the guidelines for
negotiations with TD. Mr. Solomon then provided an update to the Board on the inquiry from Company C. The
members of Company management and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and
the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols
participating. The Independent Directors noted that, because the proposals from each of TD and Company A were
contingent upon reaching satisfactory retention arrangements with the Company’s management, and the Company’s
management had not yet reached agreement on such arrangements with either party, it was advisable to continue
discussions with both counterparties and to continue engaging with other potential counterparties that had
expressed interest.
Later on July 5, 2022, following the Board meeting, acting on the July 2 instructions of the Board, Mr. Solomon
attempted to contact the Chief Executive Officer of Company B to assess whether Company B would like to have a
conversation with the Company, and left a voicemail for the Chief Executive Officer of Company B.
Also on July 5, 2022, a representative of Financial Advisor X contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that
Financial Advisor X was representing Company D, a U.S. bank with a domestic investment banking business, and
that Company D was interested in a potential acquisition of the Company and may be prepared to pay “a large
premium”. Mr. Solomon requested that, if Company D were interested, Company D submit an indication with a range
of potential values for the Board to consider. Mr. Solomon and the representative of Financial Advisor X then
discussed arranging a meeting between Mr. Solomon and the Chief Executive Officer of Company D. Later that day,
Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors on the inquiry from Company D.
On July 6, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B tried to contact and left a voicemail for Mr. Solomon
informing Mr. Solomon that he was returning Mr. Solomon’s phone call from July 5, 2022. Over the following days,
Mr. Solomon and the Chief Executive Officer of Company B tried again to contact and left voicemails for one another.
Mr. Solomon left a final voicemail for the Chief Executive Officer of Company B which was not returned, and there
was no further contact from Company B.
Also on July 6, 2022, a representative of Company A sent Mr. Solomon a retention proposal for the Company’s senior
management with “change of control” severance agreements, which consisted of guaranteed minimum compensation
for such employees, retention payments to such employees based on the proceeds realized by Company A from sales
of certain non-core assets of the Company during a three-year period after the closing of the proposed transaction
(or, if sales of any of such assets were not executed, an agreed valuation of such remaining assets) and opportunities
for additional incentive compensation based on the performance of the businesses formerly comprising the Company,
with the sum of all such payments being capped at an amount equal to 70% of the value of each employee’s
contractual “change of control” severance entitlements. Company A’s proposal did not include specific proposals
regarding roles and responsibilities for individuals of
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Company’s senior management team or any additional detail regarding compensation strategies to retain non-
management employees. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors, noting that the
compensation proposal from Company A was substantially less favorable than the retention package that had been
agreed in principle between the Executives and TD on June 30, 2022, partly because the incentive compensation
opportunities of such package were based on highly contingent factors that would be outside of the control of the
Company’s management team, but that there also remained open concerns with TD’s retention proposals, including
whether annual compensation opportunities for the Executives would be guaranteed.
On July 7, 2022, Mr. Solomon had a call with a representative of Company A to discuss Company A’s July 6 retention
proposal. A representative of Perkins Advisors participated at Mr. Solomon’s request. During this call, Mr. Solomon
proposed to Company A a retention package for the Executives that was comparable to the retention package that
had been agreed in principle between the Executives and TD on June 30, 2022 (which proposal represented aggregate
payments to the Executives substantially below the value of such Executives’ existing “change of control” severance
entitlements) and discussed structural issues relating to roles in the combined organization, including the impact of
integrating the Company’s businesses with Company A’s existing investment banking business on reporting lines
and on retention of key talent between signing and closing a potential transaction. Company A acknowledged Mr.
Solomon’s proposal and that it would respond following internal discussion thereof.
Also on July 7, 2022, the Company shared a draft mutual confidentiality agreement with Company D, and a
representative of Financial Advisor X contacted a representative of Ardea to communicate that Company D expected
to submit an indication of interest in writing on July 8, 2022.
Later on July 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s
management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.
Representatives of Ardea informed the Board that Company D was expected to submit an indication of interest in
writing on July 8, 2022, but had not yet indicated a range of potential values. Mr. Solomon provided the Board with an
update on retention discussions between the Company’s management and each of Company A and TD, noting that
open issues remained with both parties. Mr. Solomon noted that TD had conducted substantial confirmatory due
diligence and had indicated a potential ability to sign and announce a transaction as early as July 18, 2022. Mr.
Solomon also provided an update on discussions with Company B and Company C, noting that neither party had
followed up to express further interest in a transaction involving the Company as of that date. The members of
Company management and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the
Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols
participating. The Independent Directors noted that Mr. Solomon and other members of the Company’s senior
management had substantial concerns with the retention packages and compensation structures for non-
management employees proposed by each of TD and Company A, but that both potential transactions were still
viable. After discussion, the Independent Directors resolved to instruct Mr. Solomon to continue negotiations with
each of TD and Company A and to keep the Independent Directors informed of any developments, and Mr. Barth
communicated that instruction to Mr. Solomon.
On July 8, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that Company A
would not be able to reach mutual agreement with management on its proposed retention package for the Executives
or on the proposed organizational, compensation and retention structure for the Company’s employees as a part of
Company A following the proposed transaction, as such retention and organizational structures would be too
disruptive to Company A’s existing business. Mr. Solomon asked whether Company A had any counter-proposals
regarding retention and organizational structures to discuss further, and the representative of Company A confirmed
that Company A did not have a counter-proposal. Mr. Solomon thanked the representative of Company A for the time
and effort that he and his team had made, but did not engage in any further negotiations and promptly informed the
Independent Directors.
Later on July 8, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Solomon provided an
update to the Board on his discussions with Company A regarding retention and compensation matters, noting that
Company A had expressed that it would not be able to reach mutual agreement with management on its proposed
retention package for the Executives or on the proposed organizational, compensation and retention structure for the
Company’s employees as a part of Company A following the proposed transaction, as such retention and
organizational structures would be too disruptive to Company A’s
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
existing business, that Company A did not present a counter-proposal, and that the condition to the July 4 Company
A Proposal therefore would not be satisfied. The Board instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to contact Company
A’s financial advisor the following week if Company A had not reengaged to confirm whether there was a potential
path to a transaction on the terms of the July 4 Company A Proposal. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed the
terms of the draft merger agreement received from TD with the Board.
During that Board meeting, Company D sent a letter to Mr. Solomon reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire
100% of the Company’s common stock for consideration in the range of $1.539 billion to $1.847 billion, which
Company D calculated as equivalent to $40.00 to $48.00 per share of common stock based on an estimated 38.5 million
shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which we refer to as the “July 8 Company D Proposal”).
The July 8 Company D Proposal was subject to due diligence, and requested that the Company terminate
negotiations with any other party regarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company D for a
period of 60 days from the date of the Company’s acceptance of the proposal. The July 8 Company D Proposal was
also subject to various regulatory approvals, including approvals that would likely be required from the Federal
Reserve Board and international banking regulators. The July 8 Company D Proposal noted that Company D
welcomed the opportunity to discuss customary terms of retention of Company personnel at the appropriate time
during the process but did not include any proposals for management retention or specify any individuals that would
be expected to agree to retention terms.
After review and discussion, the Board noted that the July 8 Company D Proposal would be equivalent to $39.36 to
$47.24 per share of common stock utilizing the Company’s then-current share count of approximately 39.1 million
shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and the range of valuations reflected in the July 8
Company D Proposal was higher than the $39.00 per share of common stock proposed by TD in the June 15 Proposal.
However, the Board noted that the July 8 Company D Proposal was preliminary, reflected a wide range of potential
valuations, was subject to substantial due diligence, and was silent as to certain structural elements (including
whether the consideration would be in the form of cash or stock consideration and whether the proposal was
contingent on retention of Company personnel). After discussion, the Board noted that, if actionable, the July 8
Company D Proposal may provide greater value to the holders of common stock than the value proposed by either
TD or Company A, and the Board instructed the Company’s management and advisors to enter into a confidentiality
agreement with Company D and to facilitate Company D’s due diligence as quickly as possible. In addition, the Board
instructed Ardea to request that Company D provide an updated proposal by July 14, 2022, reflecting a narrower
price range based on Company D’s initial due diligence and reflecting Company D’s assumptions regarding retention
of management and any required retention arrangements. The members of Company management then exited the
meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris
Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. After further discussion regarding the response and messaging
to Company D, the representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors exited the meeting. Representatives of Cravath
then discussed with the Independent Directors certain proposed revisions to the merger agreement with TD. After
discussion, the Independent Directors authorized Cravath to send a revised draft merger agreement to TD reflecting,
among other things, a proposed company termination fee of $30.0 million, or approximately 2.0% of transaction equity
value, the removal of any closing conditions based on client consents and any key person conditions, if applicable,
with respect to the Company’s investment management and advisory businesses, and a “hell or high water”
regulatory standard requiring TD to take or agree to all actions or restrictions necessary in order to obtain any
regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger.
On July 9, 2022, Mr. Solomon had a call with the Chief Executive Officer of Company D’s investment banking division,
during which Company D expressed that Company D was interested in the Company’s research, investment banking
and equity capital markets and equities trading businesses. Company D also indicated that they viewed the proposed
transaction as a “merger of equals” for the companies’ respective investment banking businesses.
On July 10, 2022, the Company and Company D entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement, which contained a
standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition
agreement with a third party.
On July 11, 2022, representatives of Cravath shared a revised draft merger agreement with representatives of Simpson
Thacher reflecting the positions authorized by the Independent Directors on July 8.
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 12, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth formally withdrawing the July 4 Company A Proposal, noting
that Company A had been unable to find a mutual agreement with the Company’s management regarding “change of
control” severance, management and employee retention and organizational structure, which agreement was a
condition to the July 4 Company A Proposal.
Also on July 12, 2022, representatives of the Company’s management and senior members of Company D’s
management team held an in-person meeting to review a management presentation on the Company’s business,
which included the “Base Case” and “High Case” Financial Forecasts that had previously been shared with TD and
Company A. During this meeting, the representatives of Company D expressed interest in the strategic rationale for
an acquisition of the Company, which Company management and Company D’s management discussed further over
dinner.
On July 13, 2022, Mr. Barth contacted a representative of Company A to discuss Company A’s withdrawal letter on
behalf of the Independent Directors, and to explore if there was any path forward given the issues related to
organizational structure and management retention. The representative of Company A informed Mr. Barth that there
were a number of issues that would make an acquisition of the Company impracticable for Company A. The
representative of Company A noted that Company A had concerns with the cultural fit of the two organizations,
including substantial differences in the compensation structures for non-management employees (and difficulty in
integrating the Company’s compensation practices based on an aggregate compensation-to-revenue target into
Company A’s larger organization) and overlapping businesses and management roles, which, in Company A’s view,
created difficulties in creating a viable leadership structure and reporting lines for the combined organization. The
representative of Company A also noted that Company A was not willing to pay the Company’s management the
existing “change of control” severance entitlements and was not willing, in lieu of such severance entitlements, to
pay retention compensation inconsistent with the compensation rates used in Company A’s business.
On July 13, 2022 and July 14, 2022, representatives of the Company’s management and Company D held numerous
due diligence calls.
On July 13, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of Company C contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that,
given Company C’s focus on other strategic priorities, Company C would not be pursuing a transaction with the
Company at that time.
Also on July 13, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher shared a revised draft merger agreement with
representatives of Cravath, which included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 3.5% of
transaction equity value, an indication that a potential condition to TD’s obligations to close the merger related to
fund consents remained subject to due diligence, and a reinsertion of the previous limitation on TD’s obligations to
take or agree to conditions or restrictions in connection with obtaining consents or approvals required in connection
with the merger to those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be expected
to have a material and adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TD and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (with TD deemed to be the same size as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).
On July 14, 2022, a representative of Company D contacted a representative of Ardea, and informed Ardea that
Company D would need additional time to conduct due diligence and evaluate the cultural fit of the two businesses,
and therefore would not be engaging further on a potential acquisition of the Company at such time. The
representative of Company D indicated that Company D would consider reengaging in discussions in August if the
Company were still available, but would need 30 to 45 days from that point to finalize diligence for a potential
transaction. A representative of Company D subsequently contacted a representative of Perkins Advisors on July 15,
2022, and stated that Company D was concerned with potential leaks regarding a transaction involving the Company
and therefore did not want to reengage until after both Company D and the Company had announced second quarter
earnings.
On July 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Barth provided a
summary to the Board of his discussion with Company A on July 13, including his impression that it was clear, based
on that conversation, that Company A was not seriously interested in continuing to pursue a transaction with the
Company. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then provided a summary of their respective discussions
with representatives of Company D, noting Company D’s position that it would not reengage until August. The
Board discussed that waiting to reengage with Company D and for Company D to begin due diligence in August
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
would create risks related to TD’s bid, as TD had signaled a willingness to sign a transaction during July, and that, if
Company D were willing to pursue a transaction in the valuation range reflected in the July 8 Company D Proposal,
Company D would not be precluded under the merger agreement with TD from submitting a competing acquisition
proposal prior to receipt of the stockholder approval of any transaction with TD. Mr. Solomon then provided an
update on discussions with TD, noting that negotiations related to the merger agreement and individual employment
agreements for the Executives were still ongoing. Mr. Solomon provided an overview of open issues in the individual
employment agreements for the Executives, including TD’s proposal that the Executives’ annual compensation would
not be subject to annual minimum guarantees. Representatives of Cravath then provided an overview of the revised
draft merger agreement that had been received from Simpson Thacher on July 18, 2022. After discussion, the
Independent Directors authorized Cravath to send a revised draft merger agreement to TD reflecting, among other
things, a proposed company termination fee of $35.0 million, the removal of any closing conditions based on fund
consents, and a “reverse termination fee” of $100.0 million payable by TD to the Company upon the occurrence of
certain events, including the failure to close the transaction due to a denial of a required regulatory approval. The
members of Company management then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive
session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. During the
executive session, the Independent Directors and advisors discussed the alternatives available to the Company. The
Independent Directors noted their understanding that neither Company A nor Company D was seriously interested in
pursuing a transaction with the Company at that time, and that TD’s proposal was therefore the sole actionable
acquisition proposal that the Board had received. The Independent Directors also noted that TD had already
invested substantial resources in due diligence, negotiations and legal expenses, and that TD’s willingness to
execute a transaction quickly and on terms that offered substantial closing certainty were key features of TD’s
proposal. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed the Company’s advisors present to continue
negotiations with TD to attempt to finalize the terms of the proposed transaction as quickly as practicable, while
seeking terms that would maximize closing certainty, not unreasonably foreclose competing acquisition proposals
from being made by third parties and provide the Company with flexibility to retain employees between signing and
closing in order to minimize the harm to the Company’s business if, contrary to the parties’ then-current expectations,
the proposed transaction did not close. The Independent Directors also authorized the Company’s management and
Ardea to share the full Financial Forecasts with TD, given that Perella Weinberg, as TD’s financial advisor, had
requested confirmation as to whether any other projections prepared by the Company’s management existed, beyond
the Base Case and High Case projections for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 which had been previously shared.
On July 20, 2022, representatives of Cravath shared a revised draft merger agreement with representatives of Simpson
Thacher reflecting the positions authorized by the Independent Directors on July 18.
Also on July 20, 2022, the Board held a regular quarterly meeting in person, with members of the Company’s
management participating. During such meeting, the Board requested that representatives of Cravath, Ardea and
Perkins Advisors join to discuss the status of the potential transaction with TD and other proposals. The Board
discussed the fact that, while two other proposals had been submitted with a nominal value in excess of $39.00 per
share of common stock, both of those proposals had been subject to contingencies that had not been satisfied and
were not actionable (and, in the case of the Company A proposal, had been definitively withdrawn), and the TD
proposal was the only remaining actionable proposal and offered the greatest combination of value and certainty.
The Board also discussed whether, based on the receipt of other competing proposals, the Company should request
improvements to the proposed transaction with TD. The members of Company management and the representatives
of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive
session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. During the executive session, the
Independent Directors determined that, the TD proposal was the best option reasonably available under the
circumstances at that time (and was advisable to the Company and its stockholders) and that, while TD had rejected
requests for an increase in the merger consideration above $39.00 per share of common stock on three prior
occasions, TD likely had capacity to improve the terms of its proposal and instructed the Company’s advisors to seek
improvements to the terms of TD’s proposal.
On July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath and Simpson Thacher had a call to discuss the draft merger agreement.
During the call, the representatives of Simpson Thacher highlighted areas of concern for TD in the revised draft sent
on July 20, including that (i) TD was not willing to agree to a “hell or high water” standard for TD’s obligations to
seek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse termination fee in the event that any required regulatory approvals
cannot be obtained, (ii) TD was not willing to agree to any restrictions on TD’s ability to close TD’s pending
acquisition of First Horizon Corporation, (iii) TD wanted the Company to pursue a
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
restructuring to obviate the need for any NRC Approval or DFS Approval (each as defined in the section entitled
“The Merger-Regulatory Approvals in Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 80 of this proxy statement)
and (iv) TD would require a closing condition based on receipt of any required material fund consents.
Later on July 22, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives
of Cravath reflecting the positions previously communicated, as well as a proposed company termination fee of
$42.25 million.
Also on July 22, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s
management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Solomon
provided an update on discussions with TD, noting that progress had been made on the individual employment
agreements and broader employee retention issues in the draft merger agreement, as well as post-closing
compensation structures for the remaining employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention
of employees prior to closing the potential transaction. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board the
open issues in the merger agreement, including the issues that Simpson Thacher had raised on the call with Cravath
earlier in the day. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized Cravath to respond to Simpson Thacher
that, in order for TD’s proposal to continue to be the most favorable option reasonably available to the Company’s
stockholders under the circumstances, TD would need to improve deal certainty, including that (i) there would be
either a “hell or high water” standard for TD’s obligations to seek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse
termination fee of $100.0 million payable by TD in the event that any required regulatory approvals cannot be
obtained, (ii) TD would be required to seek the NRC Approval or DFS Approval, as applicable, if a restructuring or
disposition of the relevant assets could not be timely implemented and (iii) the transaction would not be conditioned
upon receipt of any non-governmental third-party consents, including fund consents. The members of Company
management and the representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent
Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath participating. After discussion, the
Independent Directors determined that, given the open issues in the merger agreement and TD’s prior rejection of
any price improvements above $39.00 per share of common stock, the best way to improve the terms of TD’s current
proposal was to maximize deal certainty in the merger agreement, particularly given the potential harm to the
Company’s business and employee retention in the event that a definitive agreement was signed and announced but
the proposed transaction failed to close.
Over the next several days, the Company and TD exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and issues lists,
and representatives of Cravath and Simpson Thacher had numerous discussions to resolve the open issues in the
merger agreement. During these discussions, TD proposed that, in lieu of a “hell or high water’ standard for TD’s
obligations to seek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse termination fee of $100.0 million payable by TD in
the event that any required regulatory approvals cannot be obtained, the Company would be entitled to expense
reimbursement from TD (which we refer to as the “expense reimbursement”) in the event that any required regulatory
approvals cannot be obtained, including (i) $10.0 million for fees and expenses, (ii) the aggregate face amount of
employee retention awards which have been allocated and communicated to employees (subject to certain limitations
and requirements) and (iii) the designated capped amount for the premium of an insurance policy that may, at the
request of TD, be bound by the Company pursuant to the merger agreement.
On July 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of
Cravath reviewed with the Board the updated terms of the draft merger agreement, including the proposed expense
reimbursement. The representatives of Cravath noted that, if the parties agreed on mutually satisfactory language
and triggers for the expense reimbursement, the provision would provide for an expense reimbursement payment of
$100.0 million and would therefore be substantively similar to the $100.0 million reverse termination fee previously
proposed by the Independent Directors. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized representatives of
Cravath to finalize a draft of the merger agreement reflecting the proposed expense reimbursement, pending final
Board approval at a subsequent meeting. The members of Company management and representatives of Ardea and
Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with
representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. Mr. Barth informed the Independent Directors that
Ardea had requested that the Independent Directors reaffirm or update the Weightings prior to Ardea delivering a
fairness opinion to the Board in connection with the proposed transaction. At the request of the Independent
Directors,
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Mr. Solomon then rejoined the meeting to provide the Independent Directors with an update on the Company’s
results to date and progress compared to the Financial Forecasts. Mr. Solomon noted that, while conditions in the
financial markets had improved and the Company’s performance had been improving in recent weeks, based on the
Company’s then-current revenue run-rate, management expected revenue for the full year in 2022 to fall below the
Base Case, and that, while the Base Case may be attainable in future periods, the Company was facing continued
headwinds in the industries in which it operates, and therefore management’s estimates of the Company’s future
financial performance had not changed. Mr. Solomon then exited the meeting. After discussion, the Independent
Directors reaffirmed the Weightings, and authorized Mr. Barth to instruct Ardea to utilize the Weightings for
purposes of any fairness opinion.
After the Board meeting on July 27, 2022, representatives of the Company, TD, Cravath and Simpson Thacher
discussed and exchanged comments to the draft merger agreement, and the Executives and representatives of TD and
Simpson Thacher discussed and exchanged comments to the draft employment agreements between the Executives
and TD. At the conclusion of these discussions, the parties had agreed on the material terms of the merger
agreement. The Executives and TD had also agreed on the material terms of the Executives’ employment agreements,
which terms were consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle reached on June 30, 2022, including waiving
their rights under their existing “change of control” severance agreements. For a detailed discussion of the material
terms of the Executives’ employment arrangements, including severance and retention entitlements, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page
70 of this proxy statement.
On July 28, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating for the purpose of
reviewing the proposed transaction with TD. Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in
connection with its consideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Ardea began to review its financial
analysis of the merger consideration of $39.00 per share of common stock. During such review, Mr. Ahmed contacted
Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that, due to a few remaining outstanding due diligence items, TD would need
until the beginning of the next week in order to finalize its due diligence and sign the definitive merger agreement.
After discussion, the Board instructed management to facilitate TD’s remaining due diligence and to finalize the terms
of the merger agreement and the Executives’ employment agreements, and determined to reconvene a Board meeting
once such due diligence was completed.
Between July 28, 2022 and August 1, 2022, the parties held numerous discussions regarding due diligence and the
merger agreement. On August 1, following completion of such due diligence, the Board held a meeting by
videoconference, with representatives of the Company’s management and representatives of Cravath, Morris
Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating for the purpose of reviewing the proposed transaction with TD.
Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of the
proposed transaction. Representatives of Ardea reviewed its financial analysis of the merger consideration of $39.00
per share of common stock. Ardea then rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated August 1, 2022, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken by Ardea in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration of $39.00 per share of class A common
stock to be paid to the holders of class A common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Ardea’s
opinion, see the section entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Ardea Partners LP” beginning on page 64 of this proxy
statement. The written opinion delivered by Ardea is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex B. Representatives
of Cravath then reviewed with the Board the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the terms of the “no
shop” provisions and the expense reimbursement provisions. Following additional discussion and consideration of
the proposed merger agreement and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the proposed merger
agreement, the Board recessed and the Compensation Committee of the Board convened and unanimously approved
certain employment compensation and other employee benefit arrangements with respect to the employees of the
Company in connection with the proposed merger agreement, including the treatment of Company equity awards. For
a detailed discussion of the material terms of the Executives’ employment arrangements, including severance and
retention entitlements, see the section entitled “-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement. Following such approval by the Compensation Committee of
the Board, the Board reconvened and unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) determined that it is fair and advisable
to, and
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii) directed that the merger agreement be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption; (iv) recommended that such stockholders vote their
shares of common stock in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the transactions contemplated
thereby (including the merger); and (v) authorized the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.
Following the conclusion of the Board meeting, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement on August
1, 2022.
On August 2, 2022, prior to the opening of trading on the Nasdaq, the parties issued a joint press release announcing
the merger.
Recommendation of the Board
At the special meeting of the Board on August 1, 2022, after consideration, including the material factors described in
the section entitled “-Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement, and detailed

of the Board, the Board unanimously:
•
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by merger agreement;

COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger,"Reasons for the Merger
As described in the section above entitled “-Background of the Merger” beginning on page 31 of this proxy
statement, prior to and in reaching its unanimous determination to (i) approve and declare advisable the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) determine that it is fair
and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement
and consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii) direct that the

by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Board consulted with and received the advice of its financial
advisors and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company’s management and considered a variety of
factors weighing positively in favor of the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including, among other things, the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not necessarily in order of
relative importance):
•
Merger Consideration; Premium to the Trading Price of the Class A Common Stock. The Board
considered the current and historical market prices of the class A common stock, including the market
performance of the class A common stock relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry
and general market indices, and the fact that the $39.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the
holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement represented:
○
a premium of 49.0% to $26.18, the closing price on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to TD’s initial
verbal offer of $39.00 per share in cash;
53TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
a premium of 62.2% to $24.04, the closing price on July 1, 2022, the last trading day prior to public
speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD; and
○
a discount of 7.1% to $41.97, the highest closing price during the 52-week period ending July 1, 2022,
the last trading day prior to public speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and
TD.
•
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value and Liquidity. The Board considered the fact that the merger
consideration is all cash, which will provide the Company stockholders immediate certainty of value and
liquidity for their shares of common stock, enables the Company stockholders to realize value that has been
created by the Company and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or
macroeconomic conditions, as compared to the Company remaining independent (especially when viewed
against the potential risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company’s businesses, including risks related
to an adverse macroeconomic environment and a prolonged market downturn). The Board also considered
that, given the impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets on the
Company’s business and financial prospects, the Board believed that, on an unaffected basis independent
of the announcement of a strategic transaction, the share price of the class A common stock was not likely
to trade at or above the merger consideration in the foreseeable future.
•
No Financing Condition. The Board considered the fact that TD and Merger Sub would have sufficient
cash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the merger agreement without obtaining third-
party financing and that the merger is not subject to a financing condition.
•
Sale Process. The Board considered the fact that it regularly reviewed the Company’s performance and
prospects in light of its business and developments in the financial services industry and the
macroeconomic environment, including reviews of potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic
transactions to enhance stockholder value, and that the Board, the Company’s management and
representatives of the Company’s financial advisors and outside counsel had engaged in extensive
discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships with other companies in the financial services
industry and their financial advisors and outside counsel over an extended period of time. In particular, the
process conducted by the Board, with the assistance of the Company’s financial advisors and outside
counsel, involved contacting, or responding to, five potential acquirors (including TD) and their respective
financial advisors, entering into mutual confidentiality agreements with, providing management
presentations to, attending numerous calls and meetings with representatives of, and granting due
diligence access to, three potential acquirors (including TD), receiving non-binding offers (and negotiating
towards receiving binding offers) from three potential acquirors (including TD), and receiving one final
binding offer from TD. The Board also considered the fact that, while the media coverage regarding the
rumor that TD was exploring an acquisition of the Company resulted in the initial outreach by two of the
five potential acquirors (Company B and Company C), neither of the two potential acquirors seriously
pursued the opportunity to explore a potential acquisition of or other strategic partnership with the
Company. The Board also considered that, while Company A and Company D had submitted non-binding
indications of interest with potential consideration per share in excess of $39.00 per share of common stock,
such indications of interest were preliminary, were subject to contingencies that had not been satisfied and
had subsequently been withdrawn, and neither Company A nor Company D had expressed further interest
in a transaction involving the Company after such withdrawals (and that Company D had not subsequently
attempted to re-engage with the Company after the announcement of Company D’s quarterly earnings). For
a detailed discussion of the sale process, see the section entitled “-Background of the Merger” beginning
on page 31 of this proxy statement.
•
The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition and Outlook. The Board considered the Company’s
operating and financial performance and outlook, including a “Low Case”, “Base Case” and “High Case”
for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 prepared by management, which forecasts are described in more detail in
the section entitled “-Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, including key
assumptions underlying each scenario and, on several occasions in the weeks and months leading up to
the execution of the merger agreement, the Company’s then-current results to date during the second
quarter of 2022 and the near-term and long-term outlook for the Company’s businesses. The Board
considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving senior management’s Financial
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Forecasts, and that, as a result, the Company’s actual results in future periods will differ, and may differ
materially, from those reflected in the Financial Forecasts. The Board also considered, based on then-
current trends, that the “Low Case” was the most likely of the scenarios reflected in the Financial Forecasts
to occur and the Independent Directors assigned probability weightings to each of the “Low Case”, “Base
Case” and “High Case” as described in more detail in the section entitled “-Background of the Merger”
beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement.
•
Best Strategic Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a thorough review of strategic
alternatives and discussions with management and the Company’s financial advisors and outside counsel,
the Board determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders. The Board also carefully evaluated, with the assistance of financial advisors, outside counsel
and members of management, the risks and potential benefits associated with other strategic alternatives,
including the possibility of the Company remaining an independent public company, and the potential for
shareholder value creation associated with those alternatives and concluded that such alternatives were
less favorable to the Company stockholders than the merger. As part of these evaluations, the Board
considered, among other factors, that:
○
during the Board’s and the Company’s discussions with potential acquirers regarding an acquisition
of all of the Company’s outstanding class A common stock, the Company also explored potential
divestitures of certain of the Company’s assets; however, despite several parties expressing an
interest in exploring potential transactions involving some or all of such assets, following the
Bloomberg News report of a rumor that TD was exploring an acquisition of the Company, the
Company was unable, as of the date of the merger agreement, to obtain binding proposals for such
divestitures that were satisfactory to the Board or would be more favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the Company and its stockholders than the terms of the merger agreement (and, as of the date
of this proxy statement, no binding proposals have been received);
○
by early May, management noted that, given the adverse macroeconomic environment, including a
broader decline in equity markets and deal-making activity and rising interest rates during the quarter,
actual revenue for the fiscal year 2022 across all core businesses was expected to be lower than the
“Base Case” Financial Forecasts for fiscal year 2022;
○
by mid-May, it had become apparent that the impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in
the broader financial markets on the Company’s business and financial prospects and the trading price
of the class A common stock, and the risks associated with remaining a standalone public company in
such an environment, including the potential impact of a downturn on the Company’s revenue and
profitability, could reach a level that may compromise the Company’s ability to compensate and retain
employees;
○
by early June, management was evaluating the implementation of potential cost cutting measures in
light of the then-current economic environment and its impact on the Company’s performance, and
management noted that, while the macroeconomic outlook was difficult to predict, if the then-current
business trends continued through the remainder of 2022, the Company’s performance would likely be
below the Low Case Financial Forecasts and, absent a partnership or other strategic transaction
involving the Company, that management would look to prepare implementation of cost cutting
measures to counteract the impact of such trends on the Company’s performance; and
○
following extensive discussions regarding potential strategic partnerships with other companies in the
financial services industry and their financial advisors and outside counsel over an extended period of
time, of the five potential acquirors engaged in such discussions, only three submitted non-binding
offers, only one submitted a final binding offer to acquire the Company and, ultimately, TD’s proposal
was therefore the sole actionable acquisition proposal that the Board received.
For a detailed discussion of the Board’s considerations, see the section entitled “-Background of the Merger”
beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Opinion of Ardea and Related Financial Analyses. The Board considered the oral opinion of Ardea
rendered to the Board on August 1, 2022, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated August 1,
2022 and delivered to the Board, to the effect that, as of the date of Ardea’s written opinion, and based
upon, and subject to, the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A
common stock, without interest, to be paid to the holders of shares of class A common stock pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed
discussion of Ardea’s opinion and related financial analyses, see the section entitled “-Opinion of Ardea
Partners LP” beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.
•
Negotiation Process. The Board considered its belief that, following extensive negotiations, the Company
obtained the highest price that TD is willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company’s
ability to cause TD to materially increase its initial offer of $32.00 per share of common stock by over 20%
between May 26, 2022 and June 5, 2022 despite a continuing decline in broader financial markets, and by
attempting to cause TD to further increase its final offer of $39.00 per share of common stock by adopting a
tactical negotiation posture in the final weeks of its negotiations with TD that was designed to lead TD to
believe that the Board expected a valuation of at least $42.00 per share of common stock in order for the
Board to be willing to approve a transaction. The Board also considered the fact that the terms of the
merger were the result of robust arm’s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge
of and at the direction of the Board, with the assistance of experienced financial advisors and outside
counsel and in the context of a competitive process, and that the Board did not authorize management to
negotiate compensation arrangements until after the Board and a potential acquiror had reached an
agreement on the price per share of common stock. The Board also considered that, after the Board
authorized management to negotiate compensation arrangements with TD and with Company A, such
negotiations were conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Independent Directors, the
Independent Directors were regularly kept apprised of the status and substance of such negotiations and
while, as a result of such negotiations, the estimated value of the compensation and retention package
agreed between TD and the Executives equivalent to approximately $223 million (including approximately
$129 million in retention awards, approximately $77 million in respect of Company RSUs, Company PSUs
and deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards previously granted in respect of prior years’
compensation and approximately $18 million in integration awards, and excluding annual bonuses for
calendar year 2022 and approximately $22 million in severance entitlements) was higher than the estimated
value of $220 million (including approximately $120 million in retention awards, and approximately $77
million in respect of Company RSUs, Company PSUs and deferred cash underlying deferred compensation
awards previously granted in respect of prior years’ compensation and approximately $23 million in pro rata
bonuses for calendar year 2022) implied by TD’s June 15 Proposal, such agreement represented a
substantial reduction compared to the estimated value of the Executives’ existing arrangements with the
Company of approximately $371 million (including approximately $229 million in severance entitlements,
approximately $77 million in respect of Company RSUs, Company PSUs and deferred cash underlying
deferred compensation awards previously granted in respect of prior years’ compensation and
approximately $65 million in pro rata bonuses for calendar year 2022) (in each case, assuming accelerated
vesting of then-outstanding Company compensation awards at a price per share of class A common stock
of $39.00). For a detailed discussion of the negotiation process, see the section entitled “-Background of
the Merger” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement.
•
Timing and Regulatory Risks. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the Company’s entry into a
definitive agreement and the risk that certain counterparties may attempt to recruit the Company’s key
employees, particularly during the weeks after Bloomberg News reported a rumor that TD was exploring an
acquisition of the Company and before the Company had entered into a definitive agreement in respect of a
strategic transaction that could be disclosed to the Company’s employees. The Board also considered the
anticipated timing of the consummation of the merger and concluded that, despite the number of regulatory
approvals required to be obtained in connection with the merger, the merger could be completed in a
reasonable timeframe. For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions related to regulatory matters,
see
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory
Matters” beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement. The Board further considered that these timing
implications could reduce the period during which the Company’s business would be subject to the
potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
•
Reputation and Expertise of TD. The Board considered the reputation and expertise of TD and its
management and the substantial financial resources of TD with its AA- rating and a $1.7 trillion balance
sheet, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with TD could be completed
relatively quickly and without financing risk.
•
Existing Resources. The Board also considered that, absent a partnership or other strategic transaction
involving the Company, management would look to implement cost cutting measures to counteract the
impact of the then-prevailing business trends on the Company’s performance and the share price of the
class A common stock. The Board also took into consideration that a prolonged market downturn could
require the Company to obtain additional debt and equity financing or to enter into collaborations or other
strategic partnerships in the future, and that any such financing, collaboration or partnership could be
dilutive to the Company’s existing stockholders, might be available only on unfavorable terms or might not
be available at all.
•
Dividends. The Board also considered the fact, that during the pendency of the merger, the Company is
permitted to pay regular quarterly cash dividends at a rate not in excess of $0.12 per share of common
stock, to the Company stockholders.
•
No Vote of TD Shareholders. The Board considered the fact that the merger is not subject to the
conditionality and execution risk of any required approval by TD’s shareholders.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement,
including:
○
that, prior to receipt of the Cowen stockholder approval, the Company may, subject to certain
conditions and limitations, including the entry into a confidentiality agreement, furnish confidential or
nonpublic information or data to and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with third
parties from which the Company has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal;
○
that, prior to receipt of the Cowen stockholder approval, the Board may, subject to certain conditions
and limitations, including certain information and negotiation rights in favor of TD, change its
recommendation that holders of the class A common stock adopt the merger agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in specified circumstances (including relating
to a superior proposal from a third party), subject to TD’s right to terminate the merger agreement and
receive payment of the Cowen termination fee of $42,250,000 in cash;
○
that, prior to receipt of the Cowen stockholder approval, subject to certain conditions and limitations,
including payment by the Company of the Cowen termination fee of $42,250,000 in cash to TD, the
Company may terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with
respect to a superior proposal from a third party;
○
the Board’s belief, after discussion with the Company’s financial and legal advisors, that the Cowen
termination fee of $42,250,000 in cash, which constitutes approximately 2.8% of the Company’s equity
value in the merger, would not preclude a superior proposal from being made;
○
the TD expense reimbursement that may be owed by TD to the Company in connection with the
termination of the merger agreement under certain specified circumstances;
○
the terms of the merger agreement granting the Company flexibility to make compensation decisions
necessary to attract and retain key employees between signing the merger agreement and
consummation of the merger, including the Company’s negotiated flexibility to grant Retention Awards
and Targeted Compensation Arrangements (as described in the section entitled “- Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Parent Retention Awards and Targeted
Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 75 of this proxy statement) and Parent’s
commitment to maintain an annual bonus incentive plan, program or arrangement for
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the benefit of the Continuing Employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice during the Continuation Period (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement); and
○
the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the representations and warranties
of the parties, which the Board determined, following extensive negotiations, taken as a whole, were
reasonable.
For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement.
•
Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that, as a general matter, holders of common stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger and who otherwise
comply with the requirements of Delaware law will be entitled to dissenters’ appraisal rights to receive the
statutorily determined “fair value” of their shares of capital stock of the Company. You should read the
section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 120 of this proxy statement and Section 262 of the
DGCL, a copy of which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available
website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, for a more complete discussion of
dissenters’ appraisal rights.
•
Specific Performance. The Board considered that the Company is entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement or to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of the merger agreement (including TD’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to
consummate the merger), in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in
equity.
•
Opportunity for Company Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the merger would be
subject to the approval of the Company stockholders, and the Company stockholders would be free to
evaluate the merger and vote for or against the merger proposal at the special meeting.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors
weighing against the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, among
other things, the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
•
No Participation in the Company’s Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that if the merger is
consummated, stockholders of the Company will receive the merger consideration in cash and will no
longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or the
combined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of the Company’s capital
stock, including any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other
transactions and/or is successful in commercializing its combination with TD’s platform.
•
Closing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all of the
conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied even if the merger
agreement is adopted by the Company stockholders.
•
Non-Solicitation Covenant. The Board considered that the merger agreement imposes restrictions on the
Company’s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and requires the Company to provide TD
with information and an opportunity to negotiate amendments to the merger agreement prior to the
Company being able to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a third
party, although the Board believes this would not preclude other potential acquirors from submitting
proposals to acquire the Company.
•
Company Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that the Company must pay TD the Cowen
termination fee of $42,250,000 in cash if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,
including to accept a superior proposal from a third party, and that the amount of the Cowen termination fee
is comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter
competing acquisition proposals and would not likely be required to be paid
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
unless the Company entered into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal
from a third party. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the merger agreement relating to these
fees were insisted upon by TD as a condition to entering into the merger agreement.
•
Company Forbearances. The Board considered that the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions,
imposes restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the effective time or earlier
termination of the merger agreement, requiring the Company to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its
business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to maintain and preserve substantially intact its
business organization, employees and advantageous business relationships that are material to it and not
to, and not permit any of its subsidiaries to, take certain actions, which may delay or prevent the Company
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending consummation of the merger. For a
detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the Company forbearances under the merger agreement,
see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Cowen Forbearances”
beginning on page 93 of this proxy statement.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the
merger might not be consummated, and the fact that if the merger is not consummated:
○
the Company’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time
and effort and will have experienced significant diversion of their attention from the Company’s
ongoing business operations during the pendency of the merger;
○
the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs;
○
the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and its ability to maintain relationships with its
customers, clients, vendors and others with whom it does business could be adversely affected;
○
the trading price of shares of the class A common stock could be materially and adversely affected;
and
○
the market’s perceptions of the Company’s prospects as a standalone public company could be
adversely affected.
•
Timing and Regulatory Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to consummate the
merger, including that the consummation of the merger depends on several factors outside of the
Company’s or TD’s control and the risk that the pendency of the merger for an extended period of time
following the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement could divert management’s attention
and have an adverse impact on the Company, including its client and other business relationships. The
Board also considered the regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate the merger, the
prospects for receiving such approvals and the fact that the parties would be required to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing conditions relating to such regulatory matters.
While the Board attempted to negotiate for a “hell or high water” regulatory standard requiring TD to take
or agree to all actions or restrictions necessary in order to obtain any regulatory approvals required to
consummate the merger, TD was not prepared to be required to take or agree to any action or restriction
that would prohibit or restrict TD from closing its pending acquisition of First Horizon Corporation, and the
Board considered that under the terms of the merger agreement, (i) the parties would be required to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for the merger and (ii) TD would
not be required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in
connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, would
have or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the business,
results of operations or financial condition of TD and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to be the same size as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole). For a
detailed discussion of the terms and conditions related to regulatory matters, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Matters” beginning on
page 96 of this proxy statement.
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Potential Future Share Price. The possibility that, although the merger provides the Company
stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which the class A common stock traded
prior to the public announcement of the merger, the price of such stock might have increased in the future
to a price greater than the merger consideration.
•
Litigation Risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the merger.
•
Tax Treatment. The Board considered that the receipt of cash by the Company stockholders pursuant to
the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Board believed that this
was mitigated by the fact that the entire consideration payable in the merger would be cash, providing
adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.
•
Other Risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the merger and the business of the
Company, as more fully described below in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement.
The Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and other countervailing factors weighing against the merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits weighing positively in favor of the merger.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that the Company’s executive officers and certain other
employees have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company
stockholders generally, including those interests that are a result of new employment agreements with TD to be
effective as of the closing of the merger, as described more fully below in the section entitled “-Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes
the material factors considered by the Board. The Board unanimously reached the conclusion to (i) approve and
declare advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; (ii) determine that it is fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders
to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; (iii) direct that the merger agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for
adoption; (iv) recommend that such stockholders vote their shares of common stock in favor of adopting the merger
agreement and approving the transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger); and (v) authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In view of the wide variety
of factors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable
to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its recommendation based on the totality of the
information available to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the Company’s management and
its financial and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may
have given different weights to different factors.
This explanation of the Board’s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the section of entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement.

employees have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company’s
stockholders generally, including those interests that are a result of new employment agreements with Parent to be
effective as of the closing of the merger, as described more fully below in the section entitled “-Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement.

Financial Forecasts",62,70
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Financial Forecasts,"Financial Forecasts
The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future performance, earnings or other
results due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the
Company has included in this proxy statement certain financial forecasts of the Company that, to the extent described
herein, were furnished to the Board, the Company’s financial advisors and certain other parties potentially interested
in a transaction with the Company, in connection with the discussions concerning the proposed merger.
These Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view
toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-
looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A summary of this
information is presented below.
The Financial Forecasts were prepared by the management of the Company on a stand-alone basis without giving
effect to entry into the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the
merger), including but not limited to: any potential synergies that may be achieved as a result of the merger, any
divestitures or other restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental
or regulatory approvals, any changes to the Company’s strategy or operations that may be implemented after the
consummation of the merger, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have
been taken if the merger agreement with Parent had not been entered into but were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger, or any costs incurred in connection with the merger. The
management of the Company did not quantify synergies that may be achieved as a result of the merger. Furthermore,
the Financial Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and
should not be viewed as relevant or continuing in that context. The Financial Forecasts consist of three scenarios, a
“Low Case”, “Base Case” and “High Case”, based on management of the Company’s reasonable best estimates and
assumptions with respect to the future financial performance of the Company on a standalone basis. Management
developed the three scenarios assuming a continued weak macroeconomic environment in the “Low Case”, a quick
return to a healthy macroeconomic environment in the “Base Case”, and a robust macroeconomic environment and
successful growth and development of early stage business initiatives (e.g., the Company’s Cowen Digital Business)
in the “High Case”. Each of these scenarios were considered by the Board and assigned a probability weighting, 55%
for the Low Case, 35% for the Base Case and 10% for the High Case, for purposes of considering and evaluating
strategic alternatives, including for use by Ardea in connection with the rendering of Ardea’s opinion to the Board
and in performing its financial analyses, as described in the section entitled “The Merger- Opinion of Ardea Partners
LP” beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.
While the Financial Forecasts were prepared in good faith, no assurances can be made regarding future events and
the estimates and assumptions underlying these financial forecasts involve judgments with respect to,
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business
decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and
regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business
and economic conditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates, and the risk and uncertainties
described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 21 of this
proxy statement, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company and,
upon consummation of the merger, will be beyond the control of the Surviving Corporation. The Company’s
stockholders are urged to review the Company’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the
Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that
the projected results will be realized. Actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in
the Financial Forecasts, whether or not the merger is consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the
Financial Forecasts below should not be regarded as an indication that the Company, the Board or their respective
financial advisors considered, or now consider, these forecasts to be a reliable predictor of future results. The
Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they nor any underlying assumptions should be relied upon as being
indicative of future results. The Financial Forecasts assume that the Company would continue to operate as a
standalone company and do not reflect any impact of the merger. In light of the foregoing, and taking into account
that the Company special meeting will be held months after the Financial Forecasts were prepared, as well as the
uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, readers of this proxy statement are strongly cautioned not to
place unwarranted reliance on such information, and the Company urges all readers of this proxy statement to review
Cowen’s most recent SEC filings for descriptions of Cowen’s reported financial results. See the section entitled
“Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 124 of this proxy statement.
The Financial Forecasts include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Unlevered Free Cash Flow,
Economic Operating Income and Economic Operating Income per Share (in each case, as defined below). The
management of the Company included forecasts of Unlevered Free Cash Flow, Economic Operating Income and
Economic Operating Income per Share in the Financial Forecasts because the management of the Company believes
that Unlevered Free Cash Flow, Economic Operating Income and Economic Operating Income per Share could be
useful in evaluating the business, potential operating performance and cash flow of the Company and because similar
non-GAAP financial measures are commonly used by investors to assess financial performance and operating results
of ongoing business operations. The management of the Company included forecasts of Unlevered Free Cash Flow
in the Financial Forecasts because the management of the Company believes Unlevered Free Cash Flow could be
useful in evaluating the future cash flows generated by the Company.
Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are not
prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the amounts
associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. While the Company
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand the
Company’s operational results and to analyze the Company’s financial and business trends on a period-to-period
basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should also note
that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement have no standardized meaning prescribed
by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, the
non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and will not be directly comparable to, similarly
titled measures used by the Company’s competitors and other companies in the Company’s industry, or any similarly
titled measures used by such companies.
Due to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP measures
only as a supplement to, not in isolation of GAAP or as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below provide certain
supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. All of the financial
forecasts summarized in this section were prepared by the Company’s management. Neither KPMG LLP (“KPMG”),
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent registered public
accounting firm nor any other person has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to
the prospective financial information contained in these financial forecasts and, accordingly, neither KPMG nor any
other independent registered public accounting firm has expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance
with respect thereto and no independent registered public
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
accounting firm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information. The KPMG reports
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the historical financial information of the Company. Those
reports do not extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The Financial Forecasts were relied upon by Ardea for its financial analysis in connection with the preparation of its
opinion and by the Board for its consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in
connection with a business combination transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP
financial measures, and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to, nor relied upon by,
Ardea or by the Board. In addition, none of the other potentially interested parties that received the Financial
Forecasts were provided with any such reconciliation. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the
financial measures in this proxy statement.
By including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, none of the Company or any of its
representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of the
Company compared to the information contained in the Financial Forecasts. Accordingly, the Financial Forecasts
should not be construed as financial guidance, nor relied upon as such, and the Financial Forecasts may differ in
important respects from the guidance, which are presented as a range and which the Company’s management
prepared based on a different set of assumptions. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement
does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company that the information contained therein is
material. The Financial Forecasts summarized in this section reflected the opinions, estimates and judgments of the
Company’s management at the time they were prepared and have not been updated to reflect any changes since such
Financial Forecasts were prepared. Neither the Company nor, after consummation of the merger, the Surviving
Corporation, undertakes any obligation, except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation, changes in general economic or industry
conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions
are shown to be in error.
The following table sets forth a summary of the financial projections made available to the Board, the Company’s
financial advisors and certain parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company (the “Financial
Forecasts”); the summary of the Financial Forecasts is not included in this proxy statement to induce any Cowen
stockholder to vote in favor of the approval of the merger proposal or any other proposals to be voted on at the

Opinion of Ardea Partners LP",70,73
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Opinion of Ardea Partners LP,"Opinion of Ardea Partners LP
Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Ardea dated June 28, 2022, the Company retained Ardea
as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
At a meeting of the Board held on August 1, 2022, representatives of Ardea rendered to the Board Ardea’s oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated August 1, 2022 and delivered to the Board, to the effect
that, as of the date of Ardea’s written opinion, and based upon, and subject to, the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock, without interest, to be paid to the holders of shares of
class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of Ardea’s written opinion, dated August 1, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken in connection
with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the Ardea opinion contained in
this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Ardea’s written opinion. Cowen
stockholders are urged to, and should, read the Ardea opinion carefully and in its entirety. Ardea provided its
advisory services and opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Ardea’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as
to how any holders of class A common stock should vote with respect to the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Ardea
reviewed, among other things:
•
the merger agreement;
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years
ended December 31, 2021;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
•
certain internal financial forecast scenarios for the Company (the Financial Forecasts, which were prepared
by the management of the Company and assigned a probability weighting (the “Weightings”) for each of
the scenarios by the Board, as discussed in the section entitled “The Merger - Financial Forecasts”
beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, as approved for Ardea’s use by the Board.
Representatives of Ardea have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company
regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the class A common stock; compared certain
financial information for the Company with similar financial and stock market information for certain other companies
the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
the investment banking industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and
considered such other factors, as Ardea deemed appropriate.
64TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of providing its advisory services and rendering the opinion described above, Ardea, with the Board’s
consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,
accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Ardea, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In addition, Ardea assumed with the Board’s consent that the
Financial Forecasts and the Weightings were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then-currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and the Board. Ardea did not make an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and Ardea was not furnished with any
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and Ardea was not furnished with any
such evaluation or appraisal. Ardea assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be obtained without
any adverse effect on the Company or on the expected benefits of such transactions in any way meaningful to
Ardea’s analysis. Ardea also assumed that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be
consummated on the terms set forth therein, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition therein, the
effect of which would be in any way meaningful to Ardea’s analysis.
Ardea’s opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, the relative merits of such transactions as compared to any strategic
alternatives that may be available to the Company, or any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Ardea’s opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of class A common stock, as of the
date of the opinion, of the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement. Ardea did not express any view on, and Ardea’s opinion does not address, any
other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with
such transactions, including, the fairness of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to, or any other
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of the Company. In addition, Ardea did not express an opinion, whether relative to the $39.00 in cash
per share of class A common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement or
otherwise, on either the fairness of the transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors, officers, directors or employees of the Company, or other
constituencies of the Company or the fairness to any person (including the holders of shares of class A common
stock) of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of the Company or any class of such persons in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. Ardea did not express any opinion as to the prices at which any securities of the Company will
trade at any time or as to the impact of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the solvency or
viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. Ardea’s opinion
was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to Ardea as of, the date of its opinion and Ardea assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion.
Ardea’s advisory services and the opinion expressed in its opinion were provided solely for the information and
assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any person should act or vote with
respect to such transactions or any other matter. Ardea’s opinion was approved by the Fairness Committee of Ardea.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Implied Acquisition Premia and Multiples
Implied Acquisition Premia. Ardea calculated that the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to
the holders of shares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement represented:
•
a premium of 49.0% to the closing price on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to TD’s initial verbal offer
of $39.00 per share in cash;
•
a premium of 62.2% to $24.04, the closing price as of July 1, 2022, the last closing price prior to public
speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD; and
•
a discount of 7.1% to the highest closing price during the 52-week period ending July 1, 2022, the last
closing price prior to public speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD.
Implied Multiples. Ardea calculated the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to the holders of
shares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as a multiple of:
•
the estimated weighted management economic operating income per diluted share (or EOI/Share) for the
Company for 2022 and 2023 based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings;
•
the consensus median 2022 EOI/Share and 2023 EOI/Share estimates for the Company published by FactSet
as of July 29, 2022; and
•
the book value per basic share (or P/BV), as of March 31, 2022, as stated in the Company’s earnings release
of April 29, 2022;

Valuation Analyses
1. Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Ardea performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company using the Financial Forecasts and the
Weightings. Using the mid-year convention for discounting and illustrative discount rates ranging from 10.5% to
11.5%, which reflect estimates of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on a standalone basis derived by
application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (or CAPM), Ardea discounted to present value as of March 31, 2022
(i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows for the Company for the nine months ending December 31, 2022 and the
years 2023 through 2026 for each of the cases in the Financial Forecasts and (ii) illustrative terminal values for the
Company as of December 31, 2026 derived by applying illustrative terminal multiples, ranging from 4.0x to 6.0x to 2026
estimated unlevered economic operating income for each of the cases in the Financial Forecasts. For each of the
cases in the Financial Forecasts, Ardea derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding
the range of present values it derived as described above for the period from March 31, 2022 through December 31,
2026 to the range of present values of the illustrative terminal values it derived as described above for such case.
Ardea then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the amount of net
debt of the Company as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of the Company and approved for Ardea’s
use by the management of the Company, to calculate a range of illustrative implied equity values of the Company as
of March 31, 2022. Ardea then divided the range of illustrative implied equity values by the total number of shares of
class A common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of the
Company, for each case in the Financial Forecasts (reflecting the preferred stock as debt in the Low Case Financial
Forecast in cases where the face value of the security would exceed the as-converted value, inclusive of any “make-
whole”, and in all other cases on an as-converted basis, inclusive of any “make-whole”) to calculate an illustrative
range of implied per-share equity values for each case. Ardea then applied the Weightings to such illustrative ranges
of per-share
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
equity values to derive an illustrative range of implied weighted per-share equity values based on the Financial
Forecasts and the Weightings, which analysis resulted in an illustrative range of present values per share of class A
common stock of $34 to $44 (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).
2. Illustrative Present Value of Future Stock Price and Dividends Analysis
Ardea performed an analysis to derive an illustrative range of implied present values per share of class A common
stock on a standalone basis, based on implied future values calculated by Ardea for shares of class A common stock
using the Financial Forecasts and Weightings.
Ardea calculated an illustrative range of implied present values per share of class A common stock as of March 31,
2022 based on hypothetical future stock prices for shares of class A common stock as of the end of each of the years
2022 through 2025 and expected cumulative dividends based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings. For
purposes of this analysis, Ardea derived hypothetical future stock prices for class A common stock by applying
multiples ranging from 4.0x to 6.0x to the Company’s weighted 1-year forward projected EOI/Share as of each of
December 31, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Ardea then discounted to present value these future stock
prices and, using the mid-year discounting convention, the estimated dividends to be paid per share of class A
common stock through the end of the applicable year to March 31, 2022, using a discount rate of 12.1%, reflecting an
estimate of the Company’s cost of equity derived by application of the CAPM. This analysis resulted in a range of
illustrative implied present values per share of class A common stock of $19 to $32 (all values rounded to the nearest
dollar).
3. Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Ardea analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the selected acquisition transactions listed below
since 2012 with a value greater than $100.00 million involving target companies in the investment banking industry
that had product offerings that were similar to the product offerings of the Company.
While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Company
and none of the selected transactions are directly comparable to the proposed merger, the selected transactions are
transactions that, in Ardea’s professional judgment and experience, involved target companies with operations that,
for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company’s results, market size and product
profile.
For each of the selected transactions, Ardea calculated and compared the announced transaction value as (i) a
multiple of the target company’s forward earnings, which we refer to as FY 1 P/E and (ii) a multiple of the target
company’s P/BV for the last quarterly period prior to the announcement date of the transaction. For each of the
selected transactions (except for the acquisition of KBW, Inc.), forward earnings represents the FactSet estimate for
the target’s diluted earnings per share (or EPS) for the first fiscal year ended following announcement of the
applicable transaction. For the acquisition of KBW, Inc., forward earnings represents the target’s four quarter period
EPS beginning with the first quarter reported after the announcement of the applicable transaction.
The following table presents the results of this analysis:

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Ardea's analysis of the various transactions and its
professional judgment, Ardea applied a reference range of FY1 P/E multiples of 9.0x to 14.3x to the estimated 2022
EOI/Share of the Company, based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings. This analysis resulted in an
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
illustrative range of implied values of $38 to $61 per share of class A common stock (all values rounded to the nearest
dollar). Ardea also applied a reference range of P/BV multiples of 1.0x to 2.1x to the book value per share as reported
by the Company as of March 31, 2022. This analysis resulted in an illustrative range of implied values of $37 to $79
per share of class A common stock (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).
4. Historical Premia Analysis
Ardea reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data obtained from FactSet, the premia paid in all-cash
acquisitions of publicly traded companies in the U.S. in the financial services industry (excluding real estate
investment trusts), listed on the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, with transaction values greater than or equal
to $500.00 million announced between January 1, 2012 and July 29, 2022. Ardea calculated the median, average and
90th percentile of the values of premia of the price paid per share relative to the target company’s last undisturbed
closing price prior to the announcement of the relevant transaction.
The following table represents the results of this analysis:
Metric
Premium
Median
27.1%
Average
34.1%

58.3%
Ardea, based on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, applied a selected
range of premia from 27.1% to 58.3% to the closing price of class A common stock on July 1, 2022, of $24.04 to derive
a range of implied values per share of class A common stock of $31 to $38 (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Ardea’s opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Ardea considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight
to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Ardea made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction
used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.
Ardea prepared these analyses for purposes of Ardea providing its opinion to the Board that, as of the date of its
opinion and based upon, and subject to, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken by Ardea, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A
common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor
do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being
based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the
Company, Ardea or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted.
The transaction consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and TD and
was approved by the Board. Ardea provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Ardea did not,
however, recommend any specific amount or type of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific
amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.
As described above, Ardea’s opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in
making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Ardea in connection with the
fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Ardea attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ardea is engaged in merger and acquisition advisory services, investment banking, underwriting services, private
placements of securities and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.
Ardea and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other
economic interest or with which they co-invest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell, hold or vote
long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, TD, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any
currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Ardea acted
as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. During the two-year period ended August 1, 2022, Ardea has
not been engaged by the Company and/or TD and/or their respective affiliates to provide financial advisory,
underwriting and/or other financial and non-financial services for which Ardea has recognized compensation. Ardea
may in the future provide financial advisory, underwriting and/or other financial and non-financial services to the
Company, TD and their respective affiliates for which Ardea may receive compensation.
The Board selected Ardea as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Ardea dated June 28, 2022, the Company retained Ardea
as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In connection
with the transaction, Ardea will receive financial advisory fees from the Company estimated, based on the information
available as of the date of the announcement, to be approximately $22.9 million, $2 million of which became payable
upon the announcement of the merger and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the Company has agreed to reimburse Ardea for certain
of its expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements and to indemnify Ardea and related persons
against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.
Certain Effects of the Merger",73,78
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Certain Effects of the Merger,"Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Cowen stockholder approval is obtained, the other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by law) waived and the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company upon the terms set forth in the merger agreement. As the surviving corporation in the merger, the Company
will continue to exist following the merger as a direct, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Parent.
At the effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(except for (i) shares of common stock owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of common
stock (A) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, or (B) held, directly or indirectly, in respect of a debt previously contracted) and (ii) any shares of
common stock with respect to which dissenters’ rights have been exercised) will be automatically canceled and
converted into the right to the merger consideration. Following the merger, all of the common stock will be
beneficially owned by Parent, and none of the current holders of common stock will, by virtue of the merger, have any
ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (except to the extent such
holder also holds shares of preferred stock), which will remain issued and outstanding following the effective time of
the merger as shares of preferred stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the exception of preferred dissenting
shares (as defined below)).
As a result, the current holders of common stock will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they
bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of the Company. Following the merger, Parent will benefit from any increase
in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the Company’s value.
At the effective time of the merger, each share of preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will remain issued and outstanding immediately following the effective time of the merger,
with the exception of preferred dissenting shares. After the effective time of the merger, the holders of preferred stock
of the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to convert their shares into the right to receive $39.00 in cash per share,
on an as converted basis at the conversion rate of 39.2214x.
See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration” beginning on page 86 of this proxy
statement.

Shares of class A common stock are currently registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market under the trading symbol “COWN”. Following the consummation of the merger, shares of class A
common stock will no longer be traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other public market. In addition,
the registration of class A common stock under the Exchange Act is expected to be terminated, and, upon such
termination, the Company will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to the
class A common stock.

COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Effects on the Company if the Merger Is Not Consummated,"Effects on the Company if the Merger Is Not Consummated
In the event that the Cowen stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any other
reason, Cowen stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the
merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the class A common stock will continue to
be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the class A common stock will continue to be registered
under the Exchange Act and the Company’s stockholders will continue to own their shares of common stock and will
continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of
the common stock.
If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your common stock, including the risk that the market price of common stock may decline to the extent that
the current market price of the common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the
merger is not consummated, there is no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be
offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of the Company will not be
adversely impacted. Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain circumstances the Company is permitted to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 110 of this proxy statement.
Under certain circumstances, Cowen will be required to pay TD a termination fee equal to $42,250,000.00 in cash and,
under certain other circumstances, TD will be required to pay Cowen an expense reimbursement including (i)
$10,000,000 for fees and expenses of third party advisors and other transaction costs, (ii) the aggregate face amount
of employee retention awards which have been allocated and communicated to employees of Cowen (subject to
certain limitations and requirements) and (iii) the designated capped amount for the premium of an insurance policy
that may, at the request of TD, be bound by Cowen pursuant to the merger agreement. For more information, see the
sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee” and “The Merger Agreement-Expense Reimbursement”
beginning on pages 111 and 112, respectively, of this proxy statement.

The consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of any financing. Parent and Merger Sub
have represented to the Company in the merger agreement that they have sufficient funds or access thereto, and
Parent will at the closing have immediately available funds in cash, to pay when due all amounts payable by it under
the merger agreement and to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement. Parent has acknowledged that the
obligations of Parent under the merger agreement are not contingent upon or subject to any conditions regarding
Parent’s, its affiliates’, or any other person’s ability to obtain financing or otherwise to raise capital for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of the merger
consideration.

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and
considered these interests in reaching the determination to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby (including the merger) and recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve the merger
proposal.
70TABLE OF CONTENTS
Jeffrey Solomon (Chief Executive Officer), John Holmes (Chief Operating Officer), Stephen Lasota (Chief Financial
Officer) and Owen Littman (General Counsel and Secretary) are the named executive officers of the Company and the
sole executive officers of the Company, and for purposes of the discussion below, are collectively referred to as the
“named executive officers” or “executive officers”. In addition, while Dan Charney (Managing Director and Co-
President, Cowen and Company) and Larry Wieseneck (Managing Director and Co-President, Cowen and Company)
are not executive officers of the Company, they have been included for purposes of certain discussions below and
are, collectively with the named executive officers, referred to as the “Executives”.
Treatment of Compensation Awards for Directors and Executives
For information regarding beneficial ownership of shares of common stock, which generally excludes the Company
compensation awards described below, held by each of the Company’s directors and executive officers and all of
such directors and executive officers as a group, see the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management”, beginning on page 115 of this proxy statement. Each of the Company’s directors and
executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each share of common stock he or she holds, the same per share
merger consideration in cash in the same manner as other Company stockholders.
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Employment Agreements (as defined below), all outstanding Company
compensation awards granted under the Equity Plans held by the Executives immediately prior to the effective time
will be treated the same way as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Compensation
Awards,” beginning on page 86 of this proxy statement except as follows:
•
Company RSUs: For each Executive except Messrs. Charney and Littman, each outstanding Company RSU
as of immediately prior to the effective time that was granted in 2019 will be assumed by Parent, except that
such Company RSU will be in respect of a number of Parent common shares that is equal to (i) the number
of shares of class A common stock underlying such Company RSU, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Following the effective time, such Company RSU (A) will vest in equal installments on each of the first,
second, and third anniversaries of the effective time, subject to continued employment, and (B) will
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the effective time (including any accelerated vesting upon qualifying terminations of employment as set
forth in the applicable Equity Plan or applicable award agreement or the employment agreement with the
Company). For Messrs. Charney and Littman, all outstanding and unvested Company RSUs as of
immediately prior to the effective time will be subject to this treatment regardless of grant year.
•
Company DCAs: For each Executive except Messrs. Charney and Littman, each outstanding Company
DCA as of immediately prior to the effective time that was granted in 2019 will be assumed by Parent. Such
Company DCA (i) will vest in equal installments on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the
effective time and (ii) will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Company DCA (including any accelerated vesting upon qualifying terminations of employment as set forth
in the applicable Equity Plan or applicable award agreement or the employment agreement with the
Company). For Messrs. Charney and Littman, all outstanding and unvested Company DCAs as of
immediately prior to the effective time will be subject to this treatment regardless of grant year.
•
Company PSUs: Each Company PSU for which, as of immediately prior to the effective time, the applicable
performance period is not complete will be assumed by Parent, except that such Company PSU will be in
respect of a number of Parent common shares that is equal to the number of shares of class A common
stock underlying such Company PSU, assuming achievement of applicable performance goals at target
level, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Following the effective time, each such Company PSU (i) will no
longer be subject to performance-based vesting conditions, (ii) will vest in equal installments on each of
the first, second, and third anniversaries of the effective time, (iii) will vest and be settled in full upon a
termination without “cause”, for “good reason” or due to death or “disability” (as such terms are defined in
the Executive Employment Agreements), subject to the Executive’s (or the Executive’s estate’s or
executor’s) valid release of claims in substantially the form attached to the Executive Employment
Agreement, and (iv) will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Company PSU immediately prior to the effective time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the effective time
occurs in 2022, then with respect to any Company

PSU for which the applicable performance period ends on or before December 31, 2022 held by the
Executives, (A) the number of Parent common shares underlying such Company PSU shall be determined
based on actual achievement of applicable performance goals as reasonably determined by the
compensation committee of the Company’s Board prior to closing in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award agreement, (B) such Company PSU will vest and be settled on the originally scheduled
vesting and settlement date, and (C) such Company PSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions applicable to such Company PSU immediately prior to the effective time.
The following table sets forth the value of the outstanding Company compensation awards that will already be held
by each of the executive officers as of January 31, 2023 pursuant to prior year deferred compensation arrangements
and previously awarded Company PSUs and the cash amounts that may be payable (on a pre-tax basis) in respect
thereof in connection with the merger. The values in the table below have been determined assuming that (i) all
Company RSUs and Company PSUs are valued based on the merger consideration of $39.00 per share, (ii) all
Company PSUs vest assuming target level of performance, (iii) the merger closes on January 31, 2023, which is the
assumed closing date only for purposes of this compensation-related disclosure, (iv) each executive officer’s
employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation without “cause” immediately following the closing and (v)
each executive officer does not receive any additional grants of Company compensation awards or forfeit any
Company compensation awards prior to January 31, 2023.

In order to promote and facilitate the signing of the merger agreement, each Executive entered into an employment
agreement with Parent (each, an “Executive Employment Agreement” and collectively, the “Executive Employment
Agreements”) which materially eliminated, reduced or deferred each Executive’s current compensation entitlements.
Such material eliminations, reductions or deferrals include, but are not limited to, the waiver of certain enhanced
change in control severance protections; the deferral of payment of certain Company compensation awards as
described above, which will result in further deferral of payment as compared to other holders of the same award;
waiver of certain retirement clauses until the third anniversary of the effective time for certain Executives, which
eliminates current entitlements for vesting acceleration of certain compensation awards; and the waiver of future
multipliers with respect to Company PSUs awarded in 2020 that may have occurred as a result of future performance.
The Executive Employment Agreements will provide for the material terms described below and are contingent upon,
and effective as of, the closing of the merger and will supersede the Executives’ existing employment agreements with
the Company.
Titles
The Executives will have the following titles: Mr. Solomon - President, TD Cowen, Executive Vice President, TD Bank
Group, and Vice Chair, TD Securities; Mr. Charney - Co-Head, Global Markets, TD Securities and Vice Chair, TD
Cowen; Mr. Wieseneck - Co-Head, Global Investment Banking, TD Securities and Vice Chair, TD Cowen; Mr. Holmes -
Chief Operating Officer, TD Cowen and Vice President, TD Bank Group; Mr. Lasota - Chief Financial Officer, TD
Cowen and Vice President, TD Bank Group; and Mr. Littman - General Counsel, TD Cowen and Vice President, TD
Bank Group.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Base Salary
The Executive Employment Agreements provide for the following base salaries: $1,000,000 for Mr. Solomon, $750,000
for each of Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck, and $725,000 for each of Messrs. Holmes, Lasota and Littman.
New Annual Variable Compensation
Each Executive will be eligible for annual variable compensation in the form of cash-based and equity-based awards,
with certain minimum amounts for the 2023 fiscal year. For the 2023 fiscal year, the Executives are entitled upon
completion of employment for such fiscal year to certain minimum amounts (pro-rated if applicable) as it relates to
their annual variable compensation as follows: $9,000,000 for Mr. Solomon, $7,750,000 for each of Messrs. Charney
and Wieseneck, $2,275,000 for Mr. Holmes, and $1,775,000 for each of Messrs. Lasota and Littman. For Messrs.
Solomon, Charney and Wieseneck, these amounts are not guaranteed. For the 2024 fiscal year, the Executives are
entitled to target annual variable compensation amounts as set forth in their Executive Employment Agreements. For
the 2025 fiscal year and beyond, the Executive Employment Agreements with Messrs. Solomon, Charney and
Wieseneck provide that their target annual variable compensation amounts will be determined consistent with TD
Securities’ practices for similarly situated senior executives of TD Bank Group, while the Executive Employment
Agreements with Messrs. Holmes, Lasota and Littman are silent.
The cash-based portion of the annual variable compensation are paid annually in January following the attributable
fiscal year and generally require continued employment through the payment date. A certain percentage of the target
annual variable compensation (or minimum amount for the 2023 fiscal year) will be subject to deferral, which, for the
first three fiscal years of employment under the Executive Employment Agreements, will be 60% for Mr. Solomon,
50% for Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck, and 45% for Messrs. Holmes, Lasota, and Littman, subject to the
applicable TD Bank policy then in effect for the Executive’s then-applicable position. For Mr. Solomon, the equity
portion of his annual variable compensation will be made in the form of Parent performance share units (“Parent
PSUs”) and stock options. The Parent PSUs will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the award date, subject to
performance, and the stock options will cliff vest after four years, subject to continued employment. For Messrs.
Charney and Wieseneck, the equity portion of their annual variable compensation will be made in the form of Parent
restricted stock units (“Parent RSUs”) that will vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the award
date, subject to continued employment. For Messrs. Holmes, Lasota, and Littman, the equity portion of their annual
variable compensation will be made in the form of Parent RSUs that cliff vest on the third anniversary following the
award date, subject to continued employment.
Retention Bonus
Each Executive will be paid a one-time cash retention bonus on the closing of the merger (the “Closing Retention
Bonus”), subject to clawback if the Executive’s employment is terminated for “cause”, the Executive resigns without
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Executive Employment Agreements), or Parent discovers that
grounds existed for termination for “cause” at any time between the execution of the merger agreement and closing,
in each case, within one year following closing. The amount of each Closing Retention Bonus is as follows:
$12,667,000 for Mr. Solomon, $10,500,000 for each of Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck, $3,333,000 for Mr. Holmes and
$3,000,000 for each of Messrs. Lasota and Littman.
In addition, each Executive will be granted a one-time deferred cash retention award (the “Deferred Retention Bonus,”
and together with the Closing Retention Bonus, the “Retention Bonus”) that will vest ratably in equal one-third (1/3)
installments on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of closing, subject to the Executive’s continued
employment through each applicable vesting date. The amount of each Deferred Retention Bonus is as follows:
$25,333,000 for Mr. Solomon, $21,000,000 for each of Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck, $6,667,000 for Mr. Holmes, and
$6,000,000 for each of Messrs. Lasota and Littman. If the Executive’s employment is terminated (i) without “cause” or
due to “disability” or the Executive resigns for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in each Executive
Employment Agreement), any unvested portion of the Deferred Retention Bonus will be paid on the original vesting
dates, and (ii) due to death, any unvested portion of the Deferred Retention Bonus will be paid within 60 days
following such termination, in each case, subject to the execution and nonrevocation of a general release of claims. If
the Executive’s employment is terminated for any other reason, any unvested portion of the Deferred Retention
Bonus will be forfeited.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Integration Bonus
Each of Messrs. Solomon, Charney and Wieseneck will be granted a one-time deferred cash integration award (the
“Integration Bonus”), which will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to continued
employment. Mr. Solomon will receive an Integration Bonus of $7,500,000 and each of Messrs. Charney and
Wieseneck will receive an Integration Bonus of $5,000,000. If the Executive’s employment is terminated (i) without
“cause” or due to “disability,” or the Executive resigns for “good reason,” any unvested portion of the Integration
Bonus will be paid on the original vesting date, and (ii) due to death, any unvested portion of the Integration Bonus
will be paid within 60 days following such termination, in each case, subject to the execution and nonrevocation of a
general release of claims. If the Executive’s employment is terminated for any other reason, any unvested portion of
the Integration Bonus will be forfeited.
Severance Benefits
Pursuant to the Executive Employment Agreements, each Executive is generally entitled to severance benefits under
Parent’s severance terms and conditions (the “Parent Severance Policy”) applicable to similarly situated employees
without regard to the length of service such Executive provided to the Company prior to the effective time. In
addition, the Executive Employment Agreements provide that, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a
general release of claims and the Executive’s continued compliance with applicable restrictive covenants, the
Executives are entitled to the following severance benefits:
•
if the Executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” or the Executive resigns for “good reason” (or
due to death for Messrs. Solomon, Charney and Wieseneck) solely during the 2023 fiscal year (or following
fiscal 2023 but prior to payment of applicable amounts, in which case the Executive will be eligible to
receive the payment described in the paragraph immediately below but no portion of the payment described
in the paragraph regarding fiscal 2024 or 2025), then:
○
for Messrs. Solomon, Charney and Wieseneck, each Executive is entitled to receive a lump-sum
amount (payable on the 60th day following such termination) equal to (i) the greater of (x) 50% of the
sum of (A) minimum amount of the annual variable compensation for the 2023 fiscal year, plus (B) base
salary for the 2023 fiscal year and (y) a pro-rata portion of the sum of (A) plus (B), less (ii) any amount
of base salary paid to the Executive during the 2023 fiscal year, less (iii) any amount of cash severance
paid (or scheduled to be paid) to the Executive under the Parent Severance Policy.
○
for Messrs. Holmes, Lasota and Littman, each Executive is entitled to receive a lump-sum amount
(payable on the 60th day following such termination) equal to the (i) (A) minimum amount of the
annual variable compensation for the 2023 fiscal year, plus (B) base salary for the 2023 fiscal year, less
(ii) any amount of base salary paid to the Executive during the 2023 fiscal year, less (iii) any amount of
cash severance paid (or scheduled to be paid) to the Executive under the Parent Severance Policy.
•
if the Executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” or the Executive resigns for “good reason”
solely during the 2024 or 2025 fiscal year (or following fiscal year 2024 or 2025, as applicable, but prior to
payment of the applicable amounts, and in the case of such termination following fiscal 2024 but prior to
payment of the applicable amounts, the Executive will be eligible to receive the payment described in this
paragraph with respect to fiscal 2024 but no portion of the payment described in this paragraph with
respect to fiscal 2025), then each Executive is entitled to receive a lump-sum amount (payable on the 60th
day following such termination) equal to (i) the pro-rata portion of the cash portion of their target annual
cash variable compensation for 2024 or 2025 fiscal year, less (ii) any amount of cash severance paid (or
scheduled to be paid) to the Executive under the Parent Severance Policy. However, for each of Messrs.
Holmes, Lasota and Littman, the amount in clause (i) will instead be an amount equal to the unpaid portion
of his total variable compensation for fiscal year 2024 if such Executive terminates his employment at the
end of the 2024 calendar year because no future role can be mutually agreed between Parent and such
Executive.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
if the Executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” or due to death or “disability,” or the Executive
resigns for “good reason,” then each Executive is entitled to receive a lump-sum amount (payable on the
60th day following such termination) equal to 24 months of monthly COBRA premiums (based on the
percentage of the health care premium covered by Parent as of such termination) for the Executive and his
dependents.
Restrictive Covenants
The Executive Employment Agreements provide for a perpetual confidentiality covenant as well as a 12-month post-
termination employee and contractual relationship non-solicitation covenant and a six-month post-termination no hire
covenant. The Executive Employment Agreements further provide for an 18-month noncompete period following the
closing of the merger, which may be extended to 24 months with the Executive’s consent for Messrs. Solomon,
Charney and Wieseneck, and for periods of 12 months and 18 months, respectively, for Messrs. Holmes, Lasota and
Littman.
Treatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses For All Company Employees
The Company and Parent has agreed to fund the 2022 annual bonus pool (the “2022 Bonus Pool”) based on the
lesser of (i) no greater than 56% of Company revenue on a “value given” (without benefits) basis (determined
consistent with past practice), and (ii) no greater than 59% of Company revenue on an “economic income” (including
the total cost of benefits, impact of deferrals, current year base salary and cash bonus, and severance) basis
(determined consistent with past practice). If the effective time occurs on or prior to December 31, 2022, the 2022
Bonus Pool will be pro-rated based on the number of days that has elapsed during the performance period through
the effective time. The 2022 Bonus Pool will be allocated by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and deferrals
will be made in accordance with the Company’s deferral programs, consistent with past practice and with prior
reasonable consultation with Parent. Any amounts payable under the 2022 Bonus Pool will be made in cash or
deferred cash awards and will generally be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
provided that, if the Company and Parent agrees to shorten the fiscal year of the 2022 annual bonus program to
match Parent’s bonus program fiscal year, such amounts will be paid at the same time as annual bonuses are paid by
Parent with respect to its 2022 bonus program.
Parent Retention Awards and Targeted Compensation Arrangements
The Company and Parent have agreed that certain arrangements be put in place for purposes of the retention of
Company employees. These retention arrangements will consist of two components: (1) a retention program (the
“Retention Program”) established by Parent for the benefit of certain Company employees and (2) agreements or
amendments to employment agreements or offer letters to maintain specified, target levels of annualized
compensation for certain Company employees provided by the Company through a certain period of time (the
“Targeted Compensation Arrangements”).
Except as may be otherwise agreed between Parent and the Company with respect to any individual award, awards
under the Retention Program will be granted in the form of Parent RSUs and will be granted by Parent on Parent’s first
regularly scheduled equity award grant date following the effective time (the “Retention Awards”). The Retention
Awards will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the effective time, subject to continued employment and certain
other conditions. In the event that an employee’s employment is terminated without “cause” (as defined in the
Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated) or due to death or disability, the employee’s
Retention Award will remain outstanding and vest on the original vesting date. The aggregate amount of the
Retention Awards will not exceed $60 million. No Retention Award will be granted to any Executive and no individual
Retention Award will be in excess of $3 million (other than (x) as set forth on a compensation annex as of the date of
the merger agreement or (y) with the prior review and approval by Parent).
The Targeted Compensation Arrangements will be provided by the Company other than the Executives to certain
employees of the Company and will consist of minimum levels of base salary and targeted bonuses through October
31, 2023. The aggregate amount of the Targeted Compensation Arrangements for all such recipients will not exceed
$225 million, and any amount of the Targeted Compensation Arrangements shall be allocated from, and shall not be
additive to, the 2022 Bonus Pool for the applicable period.
Continuing Employee Benefits
The merger agreement provides for certain customary protections regarding the compensation and benefits of
employees of the Company, including the Executives, during their employment with Parent and its affiliates
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
until December 31, 2023. These provisions are described in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Employee Benefits Matters” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.
Section 280G Mitigation Actions
The Company may take certain actions before the effective time to mitigate the amount of potential “excess parachute
payments” for “disqualified individuals” (each as defined in Section 280G of the Code). As of the date hereof, the
Company has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate the expected impact of Section 280G of the Code on
the Company and any disqualified individuals. No Executive is entitled to receive gross-ups or tax reimbursements
from the Company with respect to any potential excise taxes.
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and the executive officers will be entitled to
certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the
merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger agreement relating to director and officer
indemnification, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Indemnification”
beginning on page 102 of this proxy statement.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s named
executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger for
which payment is not conditioned upon a termination or resignation of such named executive officer (i.e., on a
“single-trigger” basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the merger (i.e., on a
“double-trigger” basis). The holders of shares of common stock are being asked to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be
binding on either the Company, the Board, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Accordingly, if the merger proposal is
approved by the holders of shares of common stock and the merger is consummated, the compensation will be
payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under “-Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The
estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the merger is consummated on January 31, 2023, (ii) the per
share merger consideration of $39.00, (iii) each named executive officer’s Executive Employment Agreement being
effective, (iv) the number of unvested Company compensation awards held by the named executive officers as of
immediately prior to January 31, 2023, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company compensation
awards prior to January 31, 2023, and (v) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination
of employment without “cause” immediately following the consummation of the merger. As such, the amounts
indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur
before consummation of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
As further detailed below, and in each case, subject to the assumptions set forth in the paragraph immediately above,
(i) the amounts quantified in the “Equity” column and with respect to the Company DCAs component in the “Cash”
column represent arrangements that existed between the Company and the Executives prior to the entry into the
merger agreement (the total amounts for such existing arrangements in the aggregate for each of Messrs. Solomon,
Holmes, Lasota and Littman equal approximately (in thousands) $26,158, $3,222, $2,973 and $3,006, respectively), and
(ii) the amounts quantified with respect to the Severance Benefit in the “Cash” column represent arrangements
entered into in connection with the consummation of the merger, and which are payable in connection with a
termination without “cause” in the 2023 fiscal year. The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any
reduction that may be required as a result of a 280G best-net cutback, which all named executive officers are subject
to; therefore, actual payments to the named executive officers may be substantially less than the amounts indicated
below.

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of (i) the severance benefits attributable to base salary and
annual variable compensation (assuming the applicable fiscal year ends on December 31 and a termination without “cause”
immediately following the consummation of the merger), (ii) the Retention Bonus and Integration Bonus (if applicable), and (iii)
unvested Company DCAs previously granted in respect of compensation for prior years as of immediately prior to the closing of
the merger, in each case, pursuant to the terms of each named executive officer’s Executive Employment Agreement. If such
executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” in the 2023 fiscal year, Mr. Solomon is entitled to a severance benefit
equal to 50% of the sum of (A) the minimum amount attributable to his 2023 annual variable compensation and (B) his annual
base salary for the 2023 fiscal year, minus base salary paid for the 2023 fiscal year through the termination date, and each of
Messrs. Holmes, Lasota and Littman is entitled to a severance benefit equal to the sum of (A) the minimum amount attributable
to their respective 2023 annual variable compensation and (B) their respective annual base salary for the 2023 fiscal year, minus
base salary paid for the 2023 fiscal year through the termination date. The Retention Bonus for each named executive officer
consists of the Closing Retention Bonus, which is payable on the closing (subject to clawback), and the Deferred Retention Bonus,
which vests ratably in equal installments over three years following the closing, subject to continued employment. Mr. Solomon is
also entitled to an Integration Bonus, which cliff vests at the third anniversary of closing, subject to continued employment.
Upon a termination without “cause,” the unvested portion of the Deferred Retention Bonus and Integration Bonus will continue
to become vested on their original vesting date(s). All unvested Company DCAs are “double-trigger” and will become vested upon
a termination of employment without “cause,” other than the unvested Company DCAs granted to (x) Messrs. Solomon, Holmes
and Lasota in 2020, which are “single-trigger” and will become vested solely as a result of the consummation of the merger and
(y) Mr. Littman in 2020, which will become vested upon a termination of employment without “cause”. All payments and
benefits described hereunder are subject to the named executive officer’s execution and nonrevocation of a general release of
claims, other than benefits with respect to “single-trigger” arrangements. Set forth below are the separate values for the cash
severance benefits, Closing Retention Bonus, Deferred Retention Bonus, Integration Bonus and unvested Company DCAs
reflected in the table above. The aggregate amount (in thousands) attributable to unvested Company DCAs that are “single-
trigger” is $2,067 ($1,575 for Mr. Solomon, $256 for Mr. Holmes and $236 for Mr. Lasota) and the aggregate amount (in
thousands) attributable to unvested Company DCAs that are “double-trigger” is $8,069 ($6,727 for Mr. Solomon, $475 for Mr.
Holmes, $428 for Mr. Lasota and $439 for Mr. Littman).

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of the named executive officers’ unvested Company
RSUs and Company PSUs previously granted in respect of compensation for prior years as of immediately prior to closing
pursuant to the terms of each named executive officer’s Executive Employment Agreement . All unvested Company RSUs and
Company PSUs are “double-trigger” and will become vested upon a termination of employment without “cause,” other than the
unvested Company RSUs granted to (x) Messrs. Solomon, Holmes and Lasota in 2020, which are “single-trigger” and will become
vested solely as a result of the consummation of the merger and (y) Mr. Littman in 2020, which will become vested upon a
termination of employment without “cause”. The value attributable to Company PSUs assumes target level of performance. All
payments and benefits described hereunder are subject to the named executive officer’s execution and nonrevocation of a general
release of claims, other than benefits with respect to “single-trigger” arrangements. Set forth below are the separate values for
the Company RSUs and Company PSUs. The aggregate amount (in thousands) attributable to unvested Company RSUs that are
“single-trigger” is $3,325 ($2,534 for Mr. Solomon, $411 for Mr. Holmes, and $380 for Mr. Lasota) and the aggregate amount
(in thousands) attributable to unvested Company RSUs that are “double-trigger” is $10,458 ($8,829 for Mr. Solomon, $582 for

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger",79,87
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders with respect to
the disposition of common stock of the Company pursuant to the merger. It is not intended to be a complete analysis
or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not address
consequences to holders of class B common stock or preferred stock or Company equity awards. This discussion is
based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and all of which are
subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax
consequences described in this discussion.
This discussion assumes that holders of common stock hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of common stock in light of such holder’s particular
circumstances, nor does it discuss the special considerations applicable to holders of common stock subject to
special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
mutual funds, partnerships or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations,
retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in
securities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign
investment companies, U.S. expatriates, holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of
stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who hold their
shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as
defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an “applicable
financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and holders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly
or constructively) 10% or more of the common stock (by vote or value) outstanding. In addition, this discussion does
not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal
non-income tax consequences (e.g., the federal estate or gift tax or the application of the Medicare tax on net
investment income under Section 1411 of the Code).
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of the
partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding common stock, you should consult your own tax advisor.
All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including
the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange
for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock, that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of common stock that is not a U.S. holder.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S.
holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
of common stock converted into cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the
date of the merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally
eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If
a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. holder must
determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.
A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate
of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the merger, unless such holder properly establishes an
exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any;
provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an
individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-
U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if the non-
U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of
30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax
treaty);
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S.
holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate) on any gain
derived from the disposition of the common stock pursuant to the merger (other than gain effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses; or
•
the Company stock constitutes a “United States real property interest” (“USRPI”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”).
If our shares of common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. holder would be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain or loss recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for such shares of common stock in the
merger on a net basis at applicable U.S. graduated rates in the same manner as a U.S. holder, and such cash
consideration may also be subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax under FIRPTA at a rate of 15%. A non-U.S.
holder’s shares of common stock generally will not constitute a USRPI, and gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder
upon receipt of cash in exchange for our shares of common stock pursuant to
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or U.S. federal withholding tax under FIRPTA, if our
shares of common stock are “regularly traded” (within the meaning of applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations) on an
established securities market at the effective time (and the non-U.S. holder holds 5% or less of the total fair market
value of such class of shares at all times during the shorter of (x) the five year period ending with the effective date of
the merger and (y) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares). We believe that our shares of common stock
are, and will be at the effective time, regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of the
applicable Treasury Regulation). In any event, the Company does not believe it has been a “United States real
property holding corporation” for United States federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period
preceding the Merger.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of
their particular facts and circumstances, the procedures for claiming treaty benefits or otherwise establishing an
exemption from U.S. withholding tax with respect to any portion of the cash consideration payable to them pursuant
to the merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding will
apply with respect to the cash received by such holder pursuant to the merger, unless such non-U.S. holder certifies
under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to
know that the holder is a United States person as defined under the Code) or such holder otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if
any; provided that such non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a
timely manner.
Dividends
The Company has historically declared and paid a cash dividend each quarter. On July 20, 2022, the Company
declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which
will be paid on September 15, 2022 to Cowen stockholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2022.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is prohibited from making, declaring, paying or setting a
record date for any dividend, or any other distribution on, or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire, any shares of its capital stock or other equity or voting securities or any securities or obligations convertible
(whether currently convertible or convertible only after the passage of time or the occurrence of certain events) or
exchangeable into or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock or other equity or voting securities, including any
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except (A) regular quarterly cash dividends by the Company at a
rate not in excess of $0.12 per share of common stock, (B) dividends paid by any of the Company’s subsidiaries to the
Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, (C) dividends provided for and paid on preferred stock in
accordance with the terms of such preferred stock and (D) the acceptance of shares of common stock as payment for
withholding taxes incurred in connection with the vesting or settlement of awards of Company RSUs or Company
PSUs, in each case, in accordance with past practice and the terms of the applicable stock plans and award
agreements thereunder.
Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board. The Board may change the Company’s dividend
policy at any time and there can be no assurance as to amount or timing of dividends in the future.

to make such filing or notice or receive such approval or non-objection (i) would result in a breach or
violation of any banking, securities or broker-dealers laws (or other material laws) applicable to TD or its
affiliates (including Cowen and its subsidiaries upon the closing) or (ii) would have a material adverse
impact on TD’s standing with applicable banking, securities or broker-dealer regulators (the “springing
approvals”).
Under the terms of the merger agreement, nothing contained in the merger agreement will be deemed to require TD
and its subsidiaries (and Cowen and its subsidiaries will not be permitted without the prior written consent of TD) to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining the
requisite regulatory approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of Cowen and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the business, results of operations or financial condition of TD and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (which, for the purpose of this sentence, will be deemed to be the same size as Cowen
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a “materially burdensome regulatory condition”).
The approval of an application means only that the regulatory criteria for approval have been satisfied or waived. It
does not mean that the approving authority has determined that the merger consideration to be received by Cowen
stockholders in the merger is fair. Regulatory approval does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the
merger.
Cowen and TD have filed all notices and applications necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals.
Although each of Cowen and TD does not know of any reason related to it or its respective subsidiaries, as
applicable, why the requisite regulatory approvals will not be received to permit the consummation of the merger on a
timely basis, Cowen and TD cannot be certain when or if the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained, or that
the granting of these regulatory approvals will not involve the imposition of conditions on the completion of the
merger.

83TABLE OF CONTENTS
Case No. 1:22-cv-08551, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a
purported Cowen stockholder, in each case, naming as defendants Cowen and members of the Board. The complaints
allege, among other things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading
preliminary proxy statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. We have also received certain stockholder disclosure demand
letters.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger,
requiring the defendants to disclose allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the proxy
statement, rescinding the Merger to the extent already consummated or in the event that it is consummated or
granting rescissory damages, awarding costs, including attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such
other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.
The defendants believe that the complaints and demands are without merit and that no further disclosure is required
to supplement the proxy statement under applicable laws. As of October 10, 2022, Cowen was not aware of the filing
of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits may be filed in the future.

merger agreement (including to implement the terms of the merger agreement providing that each issued and
outstanding share of preferred stock will remain issued and outstanding as a share of preferred stock of the Surviving

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the merger agreement, if required by the DGCL (but only to the
extent required thereby), all shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time and held by a person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, collectively, the “common
dissenting shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the merger consideration pursuant to
the merger agreement and instead will be canceled and will cease to exist and will represent the right to receive only
those rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. Each common dissenting share held by a stockholder of
Cowen who has failed to perfect, otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights to appraisal of
such common dissenting share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, as of the effective time, the right to receive the merger consideration upon surrender of the old
certificate that formerly evidenced such share of common stock in the manner provided in the merger agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the merger agreement, if required by the DGCL (but only to the
extent required thereby), all shares of preferred stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time and held by a person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, collectively, the “preferred
dissenting shares” and, together with the common dissenting shares, the “dissenting shares”) will not remain issued
and outstanding as provided in the merger agreement and instead will be canceled and will cease to exist and will
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. Each preferred dissenting
share held by a stockholder of Cowen who has failed to
87TABLE OF CONTENTS
perfect, otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights to appraisal of such preferred dissenting
share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have remained issued and outstanding in
accordance with the merger agreement.
Cowen will give TD (i) prompt written notice and copies of any written demands for appraisal or withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments that are received by Cowen relating to
demands of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and legal proceedings with respect to any
demand for appraisal under the DGCL, including any determination to make any payment to any holder of dissenting
shares with respect to any of their dissenting shares under Section 262(h) of the DGCL prior to the entry of judgment
in the legal proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal; provided that nothing in the merger agreement will
obligate Cowen to make any payment or settle any demand that is not conditioned upon the occurrence of the
effective time. Cowen will not, except with the prior written consent of TD, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands or agree to any of the foregoing.
Delivery of Merger Consideration",96,97
COWEN INC._20221011_DEFM14A_20384577_4528659.Pdf,Delivery of Merger Consideration,"Delivery of Merger Consideration
At or prior to the effective time, TD will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
designated by TD (the “exchange agent”) on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Cowen, for the benefit
of the holders of old certificates, for exchange in accordance with the merger agreement, cash in an amount sufficient
to allow the exchange agent to make all payments required pursuant to the merger agreement (the “exchange fund”).
The exchange agent will invest any cash included in the exchange fund as directed by TD, provided that no such
investment or losses thereon will affect the amount of merger consideration payable to the holders of old certificates.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to TD, or as otherwise directed by TD.
As promptly as practicable after the effective time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, TD will
cause the exchange agent to mail to each person who was, immediately prior to the effective time, a holder of record
of one or more old certificates representing shares of common stock (except for exception shares or common
dissenting shares), a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the old
certificates in exchange for the consideration for which such person may be entitled pursuant to the merger
agreement. Upon proper surrender of an old certificate or old certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
exchange agent, together with such properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such old
certificate or old certificates will be entitled to receive the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
the merger agreement, and the old certificate or old certificates so surrendered will be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued with respect to any merger consideration to be delivered upon surrender of old certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by the merger agreement, each old certificate (other than old certificates representing
exception shares or common dissenting shares) will be deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only
the right to receive, upon surrender, the merger consideration.
After the effective time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Cowen of the shares of common
stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.
Any portion of the exchange fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of common stock for one year after the
effective time will be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of common stock who have not
exchanged their old certificate pursuant to the merger agreement will look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the merger consideration, without any interest thereon. None of TD, Cowen, the Surviving Corporation,
the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of shares of common stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
TD will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or the exchange agent to
deduct and withhold, from the merger consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement to any holder of
common stock or Cowen equity awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. If TD determines that it or
any of its subsidiaries is required to deduct or withhold any amount from any payment to be made pursuant to the
merger agreement, TD will provide notice to Cowen of TD’s intent to deduct or withhold such amount and the basis
for such deduction or withholding at least fifteen (15) days before any such deduction or withholding is made to the
extent reasonably practicable, or will otherwise provide such notice as promptly as
88TABLE OF CONTENTS
reasonably practicable, and TD will reasonably cooperate with Cowen in order to eliminate or to reduce any such
deduction or withholding, including providing a reasonable opportunity for Cowen to provide forms or other
evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement
as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
In the event any old certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and, if
required by TD, the posting of a bond in such amount as TD may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such old certificate, the exchange agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed old certificate the merger consideration.

violation of any banking, securities or broker-dealers laws (or other material laws) applicable to TD or its
affiliates (including Cowen and its subsidiaries upon the closing) or (ii) would have a material adverse
impact on TD’s standing with applicable banking, securities or broker-dealer regulators (the “springing
approvals”).
TD and Cowen will have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on,
in each case, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all information and communications
appearing in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any governmental entity whose
consent or approval is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
which filing is made or which materials are submitted in respect of such consent or approval. In exercising the
foregoing right, Cowen and each TD party will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Cowen and each TD
party agree that they will consult with each other with respect to obtaining all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement (including by promptly advising each other
upon receiving any formal written communication from any governmental entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which communication is
received in respect of such consent or approval, and furnishing to the other party a copy of such communication),
and each party will consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any governmental entity
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
which meeting or conference is conducted in respect of such consent or approval and, to the extent permitted by
such governmental entity, give the other party or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences; provided, that each party will promptly advise the other party with respect to substantive
matters that are addressed in any such meeting or conference with any such governmental entity in connection with
or affecting the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement which the other party does not attend or
participate in, to the extent permitted by such governmental entity and subject to applicable law.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the previous paragraphs and bullets under this section “The Merger
Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Matters” beginning on page 96 of this proxy
statement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the merger agreement will
be deemed to require TD or any of its subsidiaries (and Cowen and its subsidiaries
99
TABLE OF CONTENTS
will not be permitted without the prior written consent of TD) to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals that, individually
or in the aggregate, would have or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, results of operations or financial condition of Cowen and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the
business, results of operations or financial condition of TD and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (which, for the
purpose of this sentence, will be deemed to be the same size as Cowen and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a
“materially burdensome regulatory condition”). Nothing contained in the section of the merger agreement related to
reasonable best efforts and regulatory matters will be deemed to prohibit or restrict TD and its affiliates from closing
the pending acquisition of First Horizon Corporation and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of February 27, 2022, by and among TD, First Horizon Corporation and certain other parties
thereto (the “FHN Transaction Agreement”) on the terms and conditions set forth in the FHN Transaction Agreement
as in effect and publicly disclosed as of August 1, 2022. Nothing contained in the merger agreement will require, or be
deemed to require, Cowen or any of its subsidiaries to take (and, without the prior written consent of TD, Cowen and
its subsidiaries will not take) any action with respect to the assets, operations or business of Cowen or any of its
subsidiaries, or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such action, in connection with obtaining any
permits, consents, approvals or authorizations of any third parties or governmental entities unless such action,
commitment or agreement is conditioned upon, or will only take effect at or after, the closing.
TD, Merger Sub and Cowen will, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the requisite regulatory approvals, this proxy statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of TD, Merger Sub and Cowen or any of their respective subsidiaries to
any governmental entity in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.
TD, Merger Sub and Cowen will promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
governmental entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite
regulatory approval will not be obtained, or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.
TD, Merger Sub and Cowen will, and will cause their respective subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain
each material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party (other than a
governmental entity) that is required to be obtained in connection with the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, in connection therewith, in no event shall TD, Merger Sub, Cowen
or their respective subsidiaries be required to make or agree to make (and, without the prior consent of TD, in no
event shall Cowen or its subsidiaries make or agree to make) any payments to any third party, concede or agree to
concede anything of monetary or economic value, amend or otherwise modify any contract to which it is a party or
bound or commence, defend or participate in any action.
Without limiting the section of the merger agreement related to reasonable best efforts and regulatory matters, none
of the parties to the merger agreement will knowingly take any action (including a business acquisition, sale or other
strategic transaction) that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, or materially impair
such party’s ability to perform its obligations under the merger agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the merger, on a timely basis.
Access to Information
To the extent permitted by applicable laws and as may be reasonable in light of pandemic measures, Cowen will, and
will cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
representatives of TD and Merger Sub, reasonable access upon prior reasonable notice, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the effective time, to its properties, books, contracts, personnel, IT assets and
records (other than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation of the merger agreement or any alternative
transactions), as is reasonably necessary for TD and Merger Sub in connection with TD’s planning for the
integration of systems (including information technology systems) and business operations after the effective time or
for purposes of preparing for the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
providing reasonable updates on Cowen’s and its subsidiaries’ businesses. TD will use reasonable best
100
TABLE OF CONTENTS
efforts to minimize any interference with Cowen’s regular business operations during any such access. Neither
Cowen nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would reasonably be expected to (i) contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of the merger agreement or obligation of
confidentiality owing to any third party, (ii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection or other legal privilege or (iii) jeopardize the health or safety of any employee of Cowen or any of
its subsidiaries; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the parties will reasonably
cooperate in seeking an alternative means whereby TD and Merger Sub are provided access to such information in a
manner that does not result in such contravention or jeopardy.
All information furnished by or on behalf of Cowen or any of its subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to the
section of the merger agreement related to access to information will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 22, 2022, between Cowen and TD. No investigation by any party or their
respective representatives will affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in the merger agreement. Nothing contained in the merger agreement will give either TD or Cowen, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the effective time. Prior to the
effective time, each party will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries’ respective operations.
Cowen Stockholder Approval
Cowen will call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after this proxy statement is mailed (with Cowen to use reasonably best efforts to hold such meeting within forty (40)
days after such mailing) for the purpose of obtaining the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter by the holders of common stock required in connection with
the merger agreement and the merger (the “Cowen stockholder approval”).
Stock Exchange Delisting
Cowen will cooperate with TD and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and
policies of the Nasdaq Global Market to enable the delisting of the common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market and
the deregistration of the common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the effective time. In
connection therewith, Cowen will promptly provide such information that may be reasonably requested by TD.
Employee Benefits Matters
The merger agreement provides that from the effective time until December 31, 2023 (the “Continuation Period”),
Parent will provide each employee of the Company as of the effective time who remains employed by Parent or its
affiliates following the effective time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) an annual base salary or base wage rate, that
is no less than that provided to such employee by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective
time, (ii) other employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, change-
in-control, retention or transaction-related benefits and defined benefit pension and post-retirement welfare benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those (subject to the same exclusions as the foregoing)
provided to such employees by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) for
Continuing Employees terminated by Parent during the Continuation Period, severance and termination benefits no
less favorable than those agreed between TD and Cowen. In addition, during the Continuation Period, Parent will
maintain an annual bonus incentive plan, program or arrangement for the benefit of the Continuing Employees in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, which provides for competitive market bonus
opportunities.
Parent will (i) honor in accordance with their terms, all of the Company’s compensation and benefit plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements in effect immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) recognize and honor all of each
Continuing Employee’s accrued and unused vacation and other paid time-off benefits consistent with the terms of
the vacation or similar policies of the Company or its subsidiaries applicable to the Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) pay all cash bonuses (including guaranteed bonuses) and
commissions that are payable to Continuing Employees with respect to the fiscal year in which the
101
TABLE OF CONTENTS
effective time occurs under the bonus or commission plans or arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
including, to the extent earned, bonuses or commissions accrued before the effective time, in the case of clause (iii),
in accordance with the terms of the applicable bonus or commission plans or arrangements or otherwise in
accordance with past practice. Parent has acknowledged in the merger agreement that the merger will constitute a
“change in control” or “change of control” (or other term of similar import) for purposes of the Company’s
compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
From and after the effective time, TD will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless and
advance expenses as incurred, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Cowen charter, the
Cowen bylaws and the governing or organizational documents of any Cowen subsidiary as in effect on August 1,
2022, each present and former director, officer or employee of Cowen or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Cowen indemnified parties”), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the effective time, arising out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of Cowen or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of Cowen or any of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Cowen indemnified party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that the Cowen indemnified
party is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to the section of the merger agreement related to indemnification and
directors’ and officers’ insurance. The Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate with the Cowen indemnified
parties, and the Cowen indemnified parties will reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Corporation, in the defense
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Without limiting the indemnification and other rights
provided in this paragraph, all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the Cowen
indemnified parties as provided in any indemnification agreement in existence on the date of the merger agreement
will survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law, and will be
honored by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries or their respective successors as if they were the
indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto.
For a period of six years after the effective time, TD or the Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Cowen (provided, that TD or the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Cowen indemnified
parties) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Cowen or any of its
subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the effective time (including the approval of the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement); provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
current annual premium paid as of August 1, 2022, by Cowen for such insurance (the “premium cap”) and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the premium cap, then TD or the Surviving Corporation will
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in TD’s or the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, TD
(or Cowen, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of TD) may (and at the request of TD, Cowen will use its
reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the effective time a six-year “tail” policy under Cowen existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the premium
cap.
The obligations of TD and the Surviving Corporation under the section of the merger agreement related to
indemnification and directors’ and officers’ insurance will not be terminated or modified after the effective time in a
manner so as to adversely affect any Cowen indemnified party or any other person entitled to the benefit of the
section of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ insurance without the prior
written consent of the affected Cowen indemnified party or affected person.
102
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The provisions of the section of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors’ and officers’
insurance will survive the effective time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Cowen indemnified party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation, or any of its
successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or Surviving
Corporation of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all its assets to any other entity or engages
in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in the
section of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ insurance.
Advice of Changes
Each of TD and Cowen will promptly advise the other of any effect, fact, change, event, circumstance, condition,
occurrence or development:
•
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a parent
material adverse effect or company material adverse effect, respectively; or
•
that such first party believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the
merger agreement or to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in the merger
agreement.
Provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach of the merger
agreement will not be deemed to constitute a violation of the section of the merger agreement relating to advice of
changes, provide a basis for terminating the merger agreement or constitute the failure of certain conditions set forth
in the merger agreement to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of the merger agreement by the party failing
to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of certain
conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to the section of the merger agreement relating to advice of changes will not cure any breach of, or
noncompliance with, any other provision of the merger agreement or limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice.
Stockholder Litigation
Each party will give the other party prompt written notice of any stockholder litigation against such party or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Cowen will:
•
give TD the opportunity to participate (at TD’s expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation;
•
give TD reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by Cowen in
connection with any such litigation, and consider in good faith TD’s comments; and
•
not agree to settle any such litigation without TD’s prior written consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Provided, that TD will not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of TD and
its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the effective time upon the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates.
Public Announcements
Each of the parties agrees that no press release or other public announcement or statement concerning the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be issued by any party without the prior
written consent of the other party (not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except:
•
as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable governmental entity or stock
exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the press release
or other public announcement or statement will consult with the other party about, and allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on, such release, announcement or statement in advance of such
issuance;
103
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases,
announcement or statements made after the date of the merger agreement in compliance with the section of
the merger agreement related to public announcements; or
•
by Cowen in connection with or following a recommendation change or its entry into an alternative
acquisition agreement in response to a superior proposal.
Change of Method
TD will be empowered, at any time prior to the effective time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of Cowen and TD, and, if and to the extent requested by TD, Cowen will agree to enter into such
amendments to the merger agreement as TD may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring;
provided, however, that no such change or requested action will:
•
alter or change the merger consideration;
•
reasonably be expected to have a non-de minimis adverse tax or other economic consequence to Cowen or
any of its subsidiaries as compared to the method or structure of effecting such combination as reflected in
the merger agreement;
•
reasonably be expected to have an adverse tax or other economic consequence to the stockholders of
Cowen as compared to the method or structure of effecting such combination as reflected in the merger
agreement;
•
require a vote by or approval of the holders of common stock;
•
include a change from a one-step merger to a tender offer; or
•
materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in
a timely manner.
Takeover Statute
Neither Cowen nor the Board will take any action within its control that would cause the restrictions of any takeover
statute to become applicable to the merger agreement, the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, and each will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from the restrictions of
any applicable takeover statute in effect on August 1, 2022, or thereafter. If any takeover statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, each party and its board of
directors will grant such approvals and take such actions within its control as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any takeover statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such
takeover statute.
Treatment of Cowen Indebtedness and Other Securities
At TD’s written request and at TD’s sole expense, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with, and provide reasonable
assistance to, TD in connection with any steps TD may determine are necessary or desirable to take to retire, repay,
defease, repurchase, redeem, satisfy and discharge, cancel or otherwise terminate effective at or after the effective
time, some or all amounts outstanding under (i) the credit agreement, (ii) the indenture, (iii) the note purchase
agreement and (iv) any other indebtedness of Cowen or its subsidiaries (including any indebtedness that replaces
the foregoing), which cooperation and assistance will include (A) arranging for (1) the optional redemption,
satisfaction and discharge, defeasance, exchange or other repurchase by TD, any of TD’s subsidiaries, Cowen or any
Cowen subsidiary of, or a tender offer by TD, any of TD’s subsidiaries, Cowen or any Cowen subsidiary for, some or
all of the notes issued pursuant to the indenture or note purchase agreement and (2) the repayment or prepayment of
any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement on or after the closing date, including, in the case of each of
clauses (1) and (2), by preparing and submitting, prior to the closing date as instructed by TD, customary notices
(subject to reasonable review and comment by Cowen) in respect of any such redemption, satisfaction and discharge,
defeasance, exchange, other repurchase, tender offer or repayment or prepayment; provided that the consummation
of any such redemption, satisfaction and discharge, defeasance, exchange offer, other repurchase, tender offer or
repayment or prepayment will be contingent upon
104
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(and only occur after, or concurrently with, but not prior to) the occurrence of the effective time unless otherwise
agreed in writing by Cowen, and (B) obtaining from the applicable lenders or agents customary payoff letters, lien
and guarantee releases or instruments of termination or discharge in respect of the existing indebtedness of Cowen
and its subsidiaries, including in respect of indebtedness under the credit agreement, the indenture and the note
purchase agreement. At TD’s written request and at TD’s sole expense, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with, and
provide reasonable assistance to, TD in connection any communications with holders of preferred stock to provide
information to such holders regarding how to elect to convert such shares of preferred stock following closing, and,
at TD’s election, Cowen will elect to mandatorily convert such preferred stock (provided that such conversion is
conditioned upon, or is effective only at or after, the effective time) if permitted pursuant to the certificate of
designation; provided that Cowen’s obligation to cooperate and assist in connection with communications to holders
of preferred stock will not require Cowen to instruct, encourage or endorse any conversion of shares of preferred
stock. TD will indemnify Cowen, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages or losses incurred in connection with
the section of the merger agreement related to treatment of Cowen indebtedness and other securities (other than with
respect to information regarding Cowen provided in writing by Cowen in connection therewith).
Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16b-3
Prior to the effective time, TD and Cowen will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of common stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
common stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Advisory Contract Consents and Fund Matters
Cowen will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain with respect to each client
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, each fund), in accordance with, and to the extent required by, applicable law or
the applicable company investment advisory contract or fund documentation, as applicable, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement, (i) the consent of such client (or the investors therein),
as applicable, for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of the applicable company investment
advisory contract is required by applicable law or by such company investment advisory contract or such fund
documentation as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) any additional consent
required from such client (or the investors therein), as applicable, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Without the prior written consent of TD, Cowen will not, and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or grant any other economic concession (including any obligation of Cowen,
any Cowen subsidiary or TD or any of their respective affiliates to make any payment or assume or incur any other
obligation or liability) to, any client (or investors therein) in order to obtain (or otherwise in connection with) any
such consent.
Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub
Following execution of the merger agreement, TD executed and delivered to Cowen, in accordance with applicable law
and the constituent documents of Merger Sub, in TD’s capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent
adopting the merger agreement and approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the
merger).
Certain Assets
Cowen will keep TD apprised of any material developments on a reasonably current basis regarding the status of any
divestiture efforts with respect to certain assets or any other business (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be
subject to TD’s consent rights set forth in the section of the merger agreement related to Cowen forbearances with
respect thereto, as applicable) and reasonably consult with TD in connection with any such divestiture.
Pre-Closing BHC Act Preparation
Prior to the closing, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with TD (including providing Parent such information as may
be reasonably requested in accordance with the section of the merger agreement related to access to information) to
develop a plan for bringing any assets, investments, commitments, activities or transactions of
105
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cowen or its subsidiaries in compliance with the BHC Act, including the Volcker Rule, upon and following the
effective time, including reasonably cooperating with TD in preparing amendments to the governing documents of
any entity that will, from and after the effective time, be controlled or be deemed to be controlled, directly or
indirectly, by TD within the meaning of the BHC Act (as reasonably determined by TD in its discretion) to include
provisions relating to the compliance, reporting and other regulatory obligations that would be applicable to such
entities as a result of being so controlled or deemed to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by TD; provided that
Cowen will not be required to commence any implementation of such plan (including not being required to adopt any
such amendments) prior to the effective time.
Insurance Policy
At the written request of TD, Cowen will use reasonable best efforts to bind (or, if TD seeks to bind a policy on
behalf of Cowen, to reasonably cooperate with TD binding), an insurance policy (the “stop loss policy”) with (a)
certain specified terms or such other terms as may be reasonably requested by TD and (b) a premium not to exceed
$30,000,000.00 (the “reimbursable premium amount”). In the event the merger agreement is terminated (other than in
the case of termination by TD pursuant to the fourth bullet set forth under the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 110 of this proxy statement or under
circumstances in which the TD expense reimbursement is payable and has been paid by TD), then TD will promptly
reimburse Cowen for the premium paid with respect to such stop loss policy and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Cowen in connection with binding such insurance policy, net of any amounts actually received (or which
Cowen is contractually entitled to receive) in connection with the cancellation or commutation of the stop loss policy.
Non-Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals
From the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement and the effective
time of the merger, Cowen is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit third-party proposals relating to
alternative transactions or to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party in
relation to an alternative transaction. Specifically, Cowen will, and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective
employees, officers and directors to (and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other representatives
to), immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations conducted before
August 1, 2022 with any person other than TD with respect to any acquisition proposal (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-No Change in Board Recommendation; Alternative
Acquisition Agreements and Intervening Events” beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement).
Cowen will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective employees, officers and directors not to,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any
acquisition proposal;
•
engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any acquisition proposal;
•
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with,
any person relating to any acquisition proposal (except (A) to notify a person that has made or, to the
knowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an acquisition
proposal, of the existence of the section of the merger agreement related to non-solicitation obligations or
(B) to clarify the terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal); or
•
unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any
term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding)
(other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the section of the
merger agreement relating to acquisition proposals) in connection with or relating to any acquisition
proposal (any such agreement, an “alternative acquisition agreement”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Cowen stockholder approval, if Cowen receives a bona fide
written acquisition proposal not resulting from a material breach of the terms of the merger agreement, Cowen may
and may permit is subsidiaries and certain of its subsidiaries’ representatives to furnish or cause to be furnished
106
TABLE OF CONTENTS
confidential or nonpublic information or data and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with the
person making the acquisition proposal, so long as, in each case, prior to taking such actions:
•
the Board, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith
that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
•
prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information, Cowen has entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the person making such acquisition proposal on terms no less favorable to Cowen than the
confidentiality agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill) and
which does not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Cowen, and Cowen will
substantially concurrently provide to TD any such information which was not previously provided to TD.
Promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, Cowen is required to advise TD following receipt of any acquisition
proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal and the substance
thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
acquisition proposal), provide TD with an unredacted copy of any such acquisition proposal and any draft
agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or acquisition proposal, and
keep TD apprised of any material developments, discussions and negotiations related thereto on a reasonably
current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or acquisition proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cowen will be permitted to waive any standstill provision to allow any person to
make an acquisition proposal if the Board, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
No Change in Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition Agreements and Intervening Events
In the merger agreement, Cowen and the Board agreed to unanimously recommend that holders of the common stock
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the “Board
recommendation”).
Subject to certain exceptions, Cowen and the Board may not engage in any of the following actions or publicly
propose to do any of the following (collectively, a “recommendation change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to TD the Board recommendation;
•
fail to include the Board recommendation in this proxy statement;
•
adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an acquisition proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt,
approve, recommend or endorse an acquisition proposal; or
•
fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any acquisition proposal structured as a
tender offer or exchange offer or (B) reaffirm the Board recommendation, in the case of each of clauses (A)
and (B), after an acquisition proposal is made public within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of
days as remains prior to the special meeting) after written request by TD to do so.
Prior to the time that the Cowen stockholder approval is obtained, the Board may make a recommendation change if
(i) (A) the Board has received a bona fide acquisition proposal which did not result from a breach of the non-
solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, which it, after consultation with its outside counsel and its
financial advisors, determines in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, in which case, the Board may also cause
Cowen to terminate the merger agreement for the purpose of entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with
respect to such superior proposal (subject to paying the required Cowen termination fee to TD with respect to such
termination, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee” beginning on page 111 of
this proxy statement), or (B) solely in response to an intervening event (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-No Change in Board Recommendation; Alternative Acquisition
Agreements and Intervening Events” beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement), and (ii) the Board after
consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith that failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, Cowen and the Board may not
take any such actions unless:
107
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Cowen delivers to TD at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, and furnishes to TD a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an acquisition
proposal, the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal, a copy of the proposed transaction
agreement(s) and all other documents relating to such acquisition proposal);
•
prior to taking such action, Cowen negotiates, and causes its financial, legal, and other advisors to
negotiate, in good faith with TD, during the three-business-day period following Cowen’s delivery of such
notice (to the extent TD desires to so negotiate) any revision to the terms of the merger agreement that TD
desires to propose; and
•
after the conclusion of such three-business-day period, the Board determines in good faith, after giving
effect to all of the adjustments or revisions (if any) which may be offered by TD, that such acquisition
proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal and failure to take such action would continue to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Notwithstanding any recommendation change, unless the merger agreement has been terminated, Cowen agreed in
the merger agreement that the special meeting will be convened and the merger agreement will be submitted to the
stockholders of Cowen at the special meeting. In addition, unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, Cowen has agreed that it will not submit any acquisition proposal to its stockholders for approval.
Cowen agreed in the merger agreement it will only adjourn or postpone the special meeting if:
•
on the date of the special meeting, there are insufficient shares of common stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute the quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting;
•
on the date of the special meeting, Cowen has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of common stock necessary for the requisite Cowen vote; or
•
required by applicable law to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is
provided to the holders of common stock a reasonable amount of time prior to such meeting.
Without the prior written consent of TD, Cowen may not adjourn or postpone the special meeting for more than
seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or postponement or more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate.
In this proxy statement, we refer to “acquisition proposal” as, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in:
•
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent or more of the consolidated assets of
Cowen and its subsidiaries or twenty-five percent or more of the common stock;
•
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent or more of the common stock; or
•
a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving Cowen or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent or more of the consolidated assets of Cowen and its
subsidiaries.
In this proxy statement, we refer to “superior proposal” as a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the Board,
after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith, after taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including the amount, form and timing of
payment of consideration, the financing thereof, any associated break-up or termination fee, including those
provided for in the merger agreement, expense reimbursement provisions and all conditions to consummation) and
the person making the proposal, is:
•
more favorable from a financial point of view to Cowen’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement (taking into account any proposal by TD to amend the terms of the merger
agreement pursuant to the section of the merger agreement relating to a recommendation change); and
•
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth therein.
108
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Provided, however, that for purposes of this definition of superior proposal, references to “twenty-five percent” in
the definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be references to “fifty percent.”
In this proxy statement, we refer to “intervening event” as any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition,
occurrence or development that does not relate to an acquisition proposal and is not known by, or reasonably
foreseeable to, the Board as of August 1, 2022 (or, if known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of August 1, 2022); provided that a change, in and of
itself, in the trading price of Cowen’s stock, the fact, in and of itself, that Cowen meets or exceeds any revenue or
earnings projections or any internal financial projections or any change or prospective change, in and of itself, in the
credit rating of Cowen will not be taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred (it
being understood that the underlying causes of such change or fact will be taken into account in determining
whether a intervening event has occurred).

The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding”, potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are stockholders of the Company may be “householding” proxy materials. A single
proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been
received from the affected stockholders. If you have received notice from your broker that they will be
“householding” communications to your address, such “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise
or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would
prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker and direct your written request to Cowen Inc.,
Attention: Investor Relations Department, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Company stockholders who
currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request “householding” of

If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of common stock or preferred stock (together, “appraisal stock”) under Section 262 of the
DGCL (“Section 262”) and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in
cash for the fair value of their shares of appraisal stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware
Court”), together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of
your shares of appraisal stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the
merger consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are known
as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be
the “fair value” of their shares of appraisal stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of appraisal stock
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result
in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of
the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments
thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights
should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or
its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of appraisal stock who (i) continuously holds such shares through
the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the
merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under
Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares, and (v) in the case
of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the
shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial
ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and
(C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be
set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of
appraisal stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to
vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to
a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This
proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of appraisal stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of appraisal stock before the taking of
the vote on the merger, which demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of
appraisal stock for which appraisal is demanded and, for beneficial owners only,
120TABLE OF CONTENTS
such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a
statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and must provide an
address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the
Chancery List; you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; you must
hold your shares of appraisal stock continuously through the effective time; and you must comply with the other
applicable requirements of Section 262.
A stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the
following address:
Cowen Inc.
599 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022
A record holder who holds shares of appraisal stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary
or other nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners
of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares
of appraisal stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of appraisal stock is not expressly stated,
the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of appraisal stock outstanding in the name of such record owner.
Within ten (10) days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the merger has
become effective to each of (1) the Company’s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal
and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and (2) any beneficial owner who has
demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the effective time, any person who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and
accept the merger consideration specified by the merger agreement for that person’s shares of appraisal stock by
delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any
person who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in
the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of appraisal stock
held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the
surviving corporation to file an appraisal petition, and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume
that the Company and the surviving corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect
to the fair value of shares of appraisal stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their shares of appraisal stock
appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods
and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, no
petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded
appraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, any person who has theretofore complied
with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving
corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of appraisal stock not voted in favor of the
merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the surviving corporation and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be given within ten (10) days after the written
request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the
period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving
corporation. The surviving corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the
office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of appraisal stock and with whom the
surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register
in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such
petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery
List.
121
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will
determine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided
thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of appraisal
stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of appraisal stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to
comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before
the merger, the shares of the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange,
the Delware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total
number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the
Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the
Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of appraisal stock taking into account all relevant factors,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest,
if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from
the effective time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date
of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such
payment only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of
appraisal stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the
surviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.
When the fair value of the shares of appraisal stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such
value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome
of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an
appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration.
Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any person
exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of
Section 262, the “fair value” of the relevant shares of appraisal stock is less than the merger consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section
262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme
Court construed Section 262 to mean that
122
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the
date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have
decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting
person’s exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the
Delaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness
fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’ and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a
person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in
connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of
appraisal stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an
award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware
Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any
purpose any shares of appraisal stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to
the effective time.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the
Delaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including
without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made under Section 262(j) of the
DGCL; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal
and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within sixty (60) days after the effective time. If no petition for
appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, all rights to
appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the merger
consideration under the merger agreement.
To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on
the other hand, Section 262 will govern.

holders of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Company
Common Stock”), of Cowen Inc. (the “Company”) of the $39.00 in cash per share of Class A Company Common

prepared by the management of the Company and assigned a probability weighting for each of the scenarios by the
Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to be used by Ardea in its financial analyses (the “Weightings”).
Representatives of Ardea have also: held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company
regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Transaction and the past
and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported
price and trading activity for the Class A Company Common Stock; compared certain financial information for the

immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock (except for Exception Shares or Common Dissenting Shares), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such person may be entitled pursuant to
Section 1.5 and this Article II. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the amount
of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 and this Article II, and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any
Merger Consideration to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate (other than Old Certificates representing Exception Shares and Common
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive,
upon surrender, the Merger Consideration.
(b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares
of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock for
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.
(d) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration or any other amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Compensation Awards such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. If Parent
determines that it or any of its Subsidiaries is required to deduct or withhold any amount from any payment to
be made pursuant to this Agreement (in each case, other than in respect of deductions or withholding arising in
connection with payments treated as compensation for applicable tax purposes), Parent shall provide notice to
Company of Parent’s intent to deduct or withhold such amount and the basis for such deduction or withholding
at least fifteen (15) days before any such deduction or withholding is made to the extent reasonably practicable,
or shall otherwise provide such notice as promptly as reasonably practicable, and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with Company in order to eliminate or to reduce any such deduction or withholding, including
providing a reasonable opportunity for Company to provide forms or
A-6TABLE OF CONTENTS
other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.
(e) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (and Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted without the prior written consent of
Parent) to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection
with obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial
condition of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the business, results of operations or
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (which, for the purpose of this sentence, shall
be deemed to be the same size as Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a “Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition”). Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to prohibit or restrict Parent and
its affiliates from closing the pending acquisition of First Horizon Corporation and the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 27, 2022, by and among Parent, First
Horizon Corporation and certain other parties thereto (the “FHN Transaction Agreement”) on the terms and
conditions set forth in the FHN Transaction Agreement as in effect and publicly disclosed as of the date hereof.

the assets, operations or business of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or commit to take any such action, or
agree to any such action, in connection with obtaining any permits, consents, approvals or authorizations of
any third parties or Governmental Entities unless such action, commitment or agreement is conditioned upon, or
will only take effect at or after, the Closing.
(e) Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(f) Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication
from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained, or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.
(g) Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to obtain each material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party (other than a Governmental Entity) that is required to be obtained in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, in connection therewith, in no event shall Parent,
Merger Sub, Company or their respective Subsidiaries be required to make or agree to make (and, without the
prior consent of Parent, in no event shall Company or its Subsidiaries make or agree to make) any payments to
any third party, concede or agree to concede anything of monetary or economic value, amend or otherwise

6.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(i) Without limiting Section 6.1(d), none of the parties hereto shall knowingly take any action (including a
business acquisition, sale or other strategic transaction) that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or materially impair such party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, on a timely basis, including as set forth in Section
6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent and Merger Sub, reasonable access upon prior reasonable
notice, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,

and business operations after the Effective Time or for purposes of preparing for the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including providing reasonable updates on Company’s and its Subsidiaries’
businesses and, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(a), allowing Parent to conduct the

minimize any interference with Company’s regular business operations during any such access. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to (i) contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or
obligation of confidentiality owing to any third party, (ii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection or other legal privilege or (iii) jeopardize

clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the parties shall reasonably cooperate in seeking an alternative means whereby
the Parent and Merger Sub are provided access to such information in a manner that does not result in such
contravention or jeopardy.
(b) All information furnished by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives
pursuant to Section 6.2(a) shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 22,
2022, between Company and Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).
(c) No investigation by any party or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth in this Agreement.

control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

(a) Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Company
Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is mailed (with Company to use
reasonable best efforts to hold such meeting within forty (40) days after such mailing) for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Unless
Company or its Board of Directors has made a Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.3(c), Company
(and its Board of Directors) shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Company the
Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to the stockholders of Company the recommendation of
Company’s Board of Directors (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that the
stockholders of Company adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) (the “Company Board Recommendation”).
(b) Except to the extent permitted by Section 6.3(c), Company and its Board of Directors shall not (i) withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or
endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse
an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition
Proposal structured as a tender offer or exchange offer or (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in
the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), after an Acquisition Proposal is made public within ten (10) business
days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Company Meeting) after written request by Parent to
do so or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through
(v), a “Recommendation Change”).
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Board of Directors of Company may make a Recommendation
Change if (i) (A) the Board of Directors of Company has received after the date hereof a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal which did not result from a breach of Section 6.9(b), which it, after consultation with its outside
counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (in which event,
subject to compliance with the entirety of this Section 6.3(c) and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote, the Board of Directors of Company may cause Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(g) in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal) or (B)
an Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii) the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with its
outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, in each case, if, but only if, (1) Company delivers to
Parent at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and furnishes to
Parent a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such
action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal, a copy of the proposed transaction agreement(s) and all other
documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal), (2) prior to taking such action, Company negotiates, and
causes its financial, legal,
A-33TABLE OF CONTENTS
and other advisors to negotiate, in good faith with Parent, during the three (3) business day period following
Company’s delivery of the notice referred to in sub-clause (1) above (to the extent Parent desires to so
negotiate) any revision to the terms of this Agreement that Parent desires to propose, and (3) after the
conclusion of such three (3) business day period, the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith,
after giving effect to all of the adjustments or revisions (if any) which may be offered by Parent pursuant to sub-
clause (2) above, that, in the case of actions described in clause (i)(A) above, such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and in the case of actions described in either clause (i)(A) or clause
(i)(B) above, failure to take such action would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law (it being agreed that, if such action is being taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, in the
event that, following delivery of the notice referred to in sub-clause (2) above, there is any material revision to
the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including any revision in price or other improvement in economic terms,
the three (3) business day period during which the parties agree to negotiate in good faith shall be extended, if
applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) business days remain to negotiate subsequent to the time Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)).
(d) Notwithstanding any Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated, the Company
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Company at such
meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger. Additionally, unless this Agreement has been terminated, Company shall not submit to or for a
vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal.
(e) Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if (i) as of the date of such meeting there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute the
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, (ii) as of the date of such meeting Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary for the Requisite Company Vote or (iii)
required by applicable law in order to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
that Company is required to provide to its stockholders by applicable law is provided to the holders of Company
Common Stock a reasonable amount of time prior to such meeting; provided, that, in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) but not clause (iii), without the prior written consent of Parent, Company shall not adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting for more than seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or
postponement or more than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2023 (the “Continuation
Period”), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide (i) each employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remains employed by Parent or any of its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with an
annual base salary or base wage rate, that is no less than that provided to such employee by Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Continuing Employees with other employee
benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, change-in-control, retention
or transaction-related benefits and defined benefit pension and post-retirement welfare benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those (subject to the same exclusions as the foregoing) provided to
such employees by Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the
Continuation Period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain an annual bonus incentive plan,
program or arrangement for the benefit of the Continuing Employees in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, which provides for competitive market bonus opportunities.
A-34TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose
employment is terminated by Parent or any of its affiliates during the Continuation Period, severance and
termination benefits no less favorable than severance and termination benefits set forth in, and in accordance
with, Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) honor all
obligations under the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) recognize and honor all of each Continuing Employee’s accrued and unused vacation and
other paid time-off benefits consistent with the terms of the vacation or similar policies of Company or its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
pay all cash bonuses (including guaranteed bonuses) and commissions that are payable to Continuing
Employees with respect to the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs under the bonus or commission
plans or arrangements of Company and its Subsidiaries, including, to the extent earned, bonuses or
commissions accrued before the Effective Time, in the case of clause (iii), in accordance with the terms of the
applicable bonus or commission plans or arrangements or otherwise in accordance with past practice. Parent
hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a “change in
control,” “change of control” or term or concept of similar import of Company under the terms of the Company
Benefit Plans to which Company is a party.
(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which any employees of
Company or its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), (i) for
any New Plan that is a health or welfare plan, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
reasonable best efforts to (A) waive all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and his or her eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (B) provide each such employee
and his or her eligible dependents with credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for any co-
payments or deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs; and (ii) for all New Plans, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
reasonable best efforts to recognize all service of each such employee with Company and its Subsidiaries (and
their respective predecessors, if applicable) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, benefit accruals,
vacation, sick or paid-time off entitlement, retirement and severance benefits (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, severance benefits under Section 6.5(b)); provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply
(A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (C) for newly-established
employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates for which similarly-situated
employees of Parent and its affiliates do not receive past service credit, (D) where such period of service was
not recognized or credited with Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, or (E) to any benefit
plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.
(e) If requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall
cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Company or any of its affiliates (each, a “Company 401(k)
Plan”) to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of
the Closing. In the event that Parent requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time, (ii) Company shall cause the unvested portion of any participant’s account balance to become vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable),
Company and Parent shall take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to each Company
401(k) Plan or the corresponding 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates (the
“Parent 401(k) Plan”), to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover
distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in cash or notes (in the
case of loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance

Employee from such Company 401(k) Plan to the corresponding Parent 401(k) Plan. If Parent requests
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in the Parent 401(k) Plan and, for the avoidance of doubt, would be
eligible to receive the same employer matching contributions as provided to participants in the Parent 401(k)
Plan generally (in each case subject to the terms and conditions of such Parent 401(k) Plan).
(f) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to (as applicable), take the
actions set forth in Section 6.5(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director, individual
independent contractor or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to employment
or service or to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Company, or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,

with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any

or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of, and subject to, Section
9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, other than

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless and advance expenses as incurred, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the governing or organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof, each present and former director, officer or employee of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company Indemnified
Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time, arising out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of
expenses, any Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.6(a). The Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company Indemnified Parties, and the Company Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the
Surviving Corporation, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Without
limiting the indemnification and other rights provided in this Section 6.6(a), all rights to indemnification and all
limitations on liability existing in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties as provided in any indemnification
agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law, and shall be honored by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries or their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying party thereunder, without any
amendment thereto.
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Company
(provided, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the Company Indemnified Parties) with respect to claims against the present
A-36TABLE OF CONTENTS
and former officers and directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Parent (or Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent) may (and at the
request of Parent, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six
(6)-year “tail” policy under Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.
(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or
modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any
other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.6 without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party or affected person.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all its
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all its
assets to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation
will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the

Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
(b) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective employees, officers and

or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal (except (A) to notify a
person that has made or, to the knowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (B) to
clarify the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal) or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated

understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement
(whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with this Section 6.9) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (any such
agreement, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a material breach of this Section
6.9(b), Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of Company, after
consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith that failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, prior to furnishing
any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, Company shall
enter into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less
favorable to Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement need
not contain a standstill) (“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), which Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company, and Company
shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any such information which was not previously provided to
Parent. Company will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide Parent with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition
Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal, and will keep Parent apprised of any material developments, discussions and negotiations
related thereto on a reasonably current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall be permitted to waive any
standstill provision to allow any person to make an Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of Company,
after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
(c) As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of
Company and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company Common Stock, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Company or its Subsidiaries

assets of Company and its Subsidiaries.
(d) As used in this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines
in good faith, after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal

break-up or termination fees, including those provided for in this Agreement, expense reimbursement provisions
and all conditions to consummation) and the person making the proposal, is (i) more favorable from a financial
point of view to Company’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(c)) and (ii)
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth therein; provided, however, that for purposes of this
definition of Superior Proposal, references to “twenty-five percent (25%)” in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%).”
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of Directors from complying with
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an

Amounts”) when due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Company (as
applicable, the “Obligee”) commences a suit which results in a judgment for the Obligor to pay the Owed
Amounts, or any portion thereof, the Obligor shall pay the costs and expenses of the Obligee (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, the Obligor shall pay interest
on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in The Wall Street Journal on
the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually
paid in full. The Owed Amounts (and any related amounts payable by the Obligor pursuant to this Section
8.2(g)), except in the case of fraud, shall be the sole remedy of the Obligee in the event of a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII pursuant to which the Owed Amounts are payable by the
Obligor.
(h) The payment of the Company Termination Fee as set forth above shall be consideration for the disposition
by Parent of its rights under this Agreement.
