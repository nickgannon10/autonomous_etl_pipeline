The Special Meeting (page 24)
The Proposals
The special meeting of our stockholders will be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a
virtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. At the special meeting, holders of our Common Stock,
$0.001 par value per share (the “common stock”), including shares classified as Class A Common Stock,
1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
$0.001 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), and shares classified as Class T Common Stock,
$0.001 par value per share (the “Class T common stock”), will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a
proposal to approve the merger (the “merger proposal”), (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “advisory compensation proposal”), and (3) a proposal to
approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are
not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the “adjournment proposal”).
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the
virtual special meeting.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14,
2022, are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or
adjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at
the special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the
record date, there were 229,163,176 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Holders of our Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share
(the “Series B preferred stock”), are entitled to receive notice of the special meeting but are not entitled to
attend or vote at the special meeting, and no vote or proxy is being solicited from such holders.
The presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of the holders of our common stock
entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum
for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting.
Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later
date that is not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to restrictions in the merger
agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities’
written consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was
originally scheduled).
Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of
our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal (the
“stockholder approval”). Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes
that our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to
authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or
fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have
the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a
condition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a
proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial
advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals,
assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect
on the outcome of such proposals.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of
approximately 1,067,169 shares of common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.47% of the voting
power of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have
informed us that they intend to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger
proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal,
although they have no obligation to do so.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proxies and Revocation
Any holder of record of our common stock entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its
shares by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by
telephone or through the Internet, or attending the virtual special meeting via the special meeting website
and voting during the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in “street name” by
your broker, you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by
your broker.
Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-
dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than the date
of your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our Corporate
Secretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone
will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized proxy.
The Merger and the Partnership Merger (page 52)
Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the company merger effective time Merger Sub I will be merged with
and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub I will cease, and the Company will continue as
the Surviving Company in the merger. On the closing date, the Company and Merger Sub I will cause articles
of merger to be executed and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The
merger will become effective upon the later of the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or such other date and time as may be agreed
between the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the articles of merger; provided, however, that
in no event will the closing of the merger be required to occur prior to the earlier of (i) a date specified by the
Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II on no less than three business days’ written notice to the
Company and (ii) October 21, 2022. We use the term “company merger effective time” in this proxy statement
to refer to the time that the merger becomes effective and the term “Surviving Company” to refer to the
surviving entity in the merger following the company merger effective time.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the partnership merger effective time Merger Sub II will be merged with
and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership (the “partnership
merger”).The completion of the partnership merger is subject to the same conditions as the completion of the
merger and will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed by the applicable parties to the merger
agreement and specified in the certificate of merger. Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to
the “merger” in this proxy statement, we are referring to both the merger and the partnership merger. We use
the term “partnership merger effective time” in this proxy statement to refer to the time that the partnership
merger becomes effective and the term “Surviving Partnership” to refer to the surviving entity in the
partnership merger following the partnership merger effective time.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors (page 34)
Our board of directors has unanimously:
determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders;
authorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement; and
directed that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of our
common stock at the special meeting.
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Opinion of Our Financial Advisor (page 37)
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
On May 5, 2022, at a meeting of our board of directors, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”)
rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion,
dated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, and taking into account the Paid
Broker Dealer Fees (as defined below), both the per Company A share merger consideration to be received by
the holders of Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger consideration to be received by
the holders of Class T common stock (in each case, other than the excluded common shares) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company’s common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated May 6, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit
B and hereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Stockholders are urged to, and should, read the
opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is directed to the Company’s board of directors and
addresses only the fairness of the per Company A share merger consideration to be received by the holders of the
Company’s Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger consideration to be received by the holders of
the Company’s Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company’s common stock
as of the date of the opinion. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Morgan Stanley’s engagement and its opinion were for the
benefit of our board of directors (in its capacity as such), and Morgan Stanley’s opinion was rendered to our board of
directors in connection with the board’s evaluation of the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address any other
aspect of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and was not intended to, and does not, constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act at the special meeting to be held or
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Treatment of Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, RSU Awards and Warrants (page 53)
Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that at the company merger effective time, each share of our common stock
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (other than shares
owned by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the Company or Merger
Sub I as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (collectively, the “excluded common
shares”)) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.768 per share
for each share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share for each share of Class T common stock, in
each case without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (respectively, the “per Company A
share merger consideration” and the “per Company T share merger consideration,” and, collectively, the
“common stock merger consideration”). Excluded common shares will be automatically cancelled and retired
and will cease to exist with no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. If we declare
or make a distribution on our common stock reasonably necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT
under the Code or to avoid the payment of income or excise tax under the Code, in each case as permitted
under the merger agreement, the per Company A share merger consideration and/or the per Company T share
merger consideration (as applicable) will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such
distribution.
Series B Preferred Stock
The merger agreement provides that at the company merger effective time, each share of our Series B
preferred stock, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (other
than shares owned by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the
Company
4 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or Merger Sub I as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (collectively, the “excluded
preferred shares,” and, together with the excluded common shares, the “excluded shares”)) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the applicable optional
redemption price, as determined in accordance with the Articles Supplementary governing the Series B
preferred stock, less any applicable withholding taxes (the “per Company Series B preferred share merger
consideration”). Excluded preferred shares will be automatically cancelled and retired and will cease to exist
with no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.
RSU Awards
The merger agreement provides that effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each
award of restricted stock units (whether vested or unvested) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Long-
Term Incentive Plan, as amended (an “RSU award”), outstanding as of immediately prior to the company
merger effective time will be cancelled, in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the
number of shares of Class A common stock subject to the RSU award immediately prior to the company
merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share merger consideration, less any applicable
withholding taxes.
Warrants
The merger agreement requires the Partnership to deliver a “call notice” to the holders of record of warrants
to purchase outstanding Class A OP units of the Partnership (the “warrants” and the “Class A OP units,”
respectively), the Class A OP units issued upon exercise of such warrants, and the shares of common stock
issued upon redemption of such Class A OP units (each, a “callable security”). Effective as of immediately
prior to the closing, each callable security held by such holders will be purchased by the Partnership, and at
or prior to the partnership merger effective time, the Parent Entities will pay (or cause to be paid) to the
Partnership the aggregate “call price,” as determined in accordance with the warrant certificate relating
thereto, for the benefit of such holders.
Treatment of Partnership Units (page 54)
The merger agreement provides that at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A OP unit (other
than units held by the Company or any of our wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “continuing
units”) and units held by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub II or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent
Entities or Merger Sub II (collectively, the “cancelled units”), in each case as of immediately prior to the
partnership merger effective time) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $6.768 per unit, without interest (the “per Partnership unit merger consideration”).
Financing (page 44)
In connection with the closing of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, the Parent Entities will cause an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion to be paid to the holders
of common stock, Series B preferred stock, RSU awards, warrants and Class A OP units (other than excluded
shares).
In connection with the merger agreement, the Parent Entities have entered into a commitment letter with
certain lenders to obtain debt financing in connection with the mergers. Also in connection with the merger
agreement, the Sponsors have entered into an equity commitment letter to contribute equity to the Parent
Entities for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not
covered by such debt financing.
The Parent Entities have informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds
to be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the
refinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and
expenses related to the financing and the mergers. The Parent Entities have informed us that they currently
believe that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be secured by, among other
5 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and
reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in
the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed
and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of
the mergers. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause our
subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to cooperate as may be customary and reasonably
requested by the Parent Entities to the extent required in connection with the arrangement of debt financing.
For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Certain Other Covenants” and “The
Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.”
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 44)
Some of our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was
aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the decision to authorize and
approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger.”
Company Acquisition Proposals and Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation (page
61)
“No-Shop” Period
Under the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the date of the merger agreement we have agreed to
cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with any person with respect to any
Company acquisition proposal and not to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company acquisition proposal, and, subject to certain exceptions, we are not permitted to enter into
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide non-public information to a third party in connection
with, any Company acquisition proposals. However, we may, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder
approval, engage in discussions or negotiations and provide non-public information to a third party that has
made an unsolicited written bona fide Company acquisition proposal, if the Company’s board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Company acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal.
Prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, our board of directors may, in certain circumstances,
effect an adverse recommendation change, subject to complying with specified notice requirements to the
Parent Entities and other conditions set forth in the merger agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation.”
Conditions to the Mergers (page 65)
Completion of the mergers depend upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including
among others:
the merger proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common
stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter;
no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any law or order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in effect

and has the effect of making the mergers illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the mergers;
the Company’s and the Partnership’s, and the Parent Entities’, Merger Sub I’s and Merger Sub
II’s, respective representations and warranties in the merger agreement must be true and correct
in the manner described under “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers”;
the Company and the Partnership, and the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II,
must have performed and complied, in all material respects, with our and their respective
obligations, agreements and covenants required by the merger agreement to be performed or
complied with on or prior to the closing date;
the Parent Entities must have received a REIT qualification opinion of our counsel, Clifford
Chance US LLP, dated as of the closing date and addressed to the Parent Entities, based on an
officer’s certificate of the Company; and
from the date of the merger agreement through the closing date, there must not have occurred a
change, event, state of facts or development which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a “Company Material Adverse Effect”  (as defined in the
merger agreement).
Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 66)
The Company and the Parent Entities may mutually agree by written consent to terminate and abandon the
merger agreement at any time prior to the closing date, whether before or after we have obtained the requisite
stockholder approval.
Termination by the Company or the Parent Entities
The Company, on the one hand, or the Parent Entities, on the other hand, may terminate and abandon the
merger agreement by written notice to the other at any time prior to the closing date, whether before or after
we have obtained the requisite stockholder approval, if:
any governmental entity of competent authority has issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the mergers
substantially on the terms contemplated by the merger agreement, and such order, decree,
ruling or other action has become final and non-appealable, provided that the right to so
terminate the merger agreement is not available to a party if the issuance of such order, decree
or ruling or taking of such other action was primarily due to the failure of the Company or the
Partnership, in the case of termination by us, or of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger
Sub II, in the case of termination by the Parent Entities, to perform any of its obligations under
the merger agreement;
the mergers have not been consummated on or before November 7, 2022 (the “outside date”),
provided that the right to so terminate the merger agreement is not available to a party if the
Company or the Partnership, in the case of termination by us, or if the Parent Entities, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II, in the case of termination by the Parent Entities, has breached in any
material respect its obligations under the merger agreement in any manner that has caused or
resulted in the failure to consummate the mergers on or before the outside date (such
termination event, the “first Company termination fee event” or the “first Parent termination fee
event”); or
the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained at the duly held special meeting of
our stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which the merger is voted on
(such termination event, the “second Company termination fee event” or the “Company
expense reimbursement payment event”).

Termination by the Company
The Company may also terminate and abandon the merger agreement by written notice to the Parent Entities
at any time prior to the closing date, whether before or after we have obtained the requisite stockholder
approval, if:
prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, our board of directors effects an adverse
recommendation change and has approved, and concurrently with the termination of the merger
agreement, the Company enters into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of
a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of our no-shop obligations under the
merger agreement, provided that the Company will have previously or concurrently paid the
Company termination fee (such termination event, the “third Company termination fee event”);
the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II have breached or failed to perform any of its

additional conditions to the obligations of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II to effect the merger have been satisfied or waived by the Parent Entities,
and on or after the date that the closing of the merger should have occurred pursuant
to the merger agreement, the Company has delivered to the Parent Entities written
notice to that effect (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied

date of such notice if the closing of the merger were to occur on the date of such
notice); and the Company and the Partnership are prepared to consummate the closing
of the merger; and
the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II fail to consummate the closing of
the merger on or before the third business day after delivery of such notice, and the
Company and the Partnership are prepared to consummate the closing of the merger

at any time prior to the closing date, whether before or after we have obtained the requisite stockholder
approval, if:

warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement in any material
respect (such termination event, the “fourth Company termination fee event”); or

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, other than certain litigation expenses in enforcing its
right to the Parent termination fee and certain indemnification and reimbursement rights related to
cooperation with the Parent Entities’ financing plan and cooperation with potential corporate restructuring or
asset sales.
In connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsors have entered into a limited guarantee in our favor to
severally guarantee the Parent Entities’ payment obligations with respect to the Parent termination fee and
certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Parent Entities and the Surviving
Company under the merger agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the limited guarantee,
up to $155 million.
We cannot seek specific performance to require the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to
consummate the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, the
Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II may seek specific performance to require the Company and
the Partnership to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Payments-​Parent
Termination Fee.”
Regulatory Matters (page 48)
We are unaware of any material U.S. federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are
required for the execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger for the
merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and the filing of the certificate of
merger for the partnership merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware.
No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal (page 71)
We are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Holders of our stock may not exercise any appraisal
rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the “MGCL”), our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such
rights unless our board of directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, determines that
the rights apply. Our board of directors has not made such a determination.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 48)
The receipt of the common stock merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the
merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. stockholders generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with
respect to their shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger and their adjusted tax basis in such
shares. In addition, if a stockholder fails to provide a completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) Form W-9, we or the Parent Entities generally are required to withhold 15% of the merger
consideration otherwise payable to such stockholder pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property
Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax
consequences of the merger to you.
Holders of shares of our common stock should read the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the receipt of the common stock merger consideration in exchange for the shares of our
common stock pursuant to the merger. Such holders should also consult their tax advisors for a complete
analysis of the effect of the merger on their U.S. federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.
Deregistration of Our Common Stock (page 51)
If the merger is completed, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

The following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the
proposed merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a
stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the
exhibits and the additional documents to which it refers, including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to
this proxy statement as Exhibit A.
What is the proposed transaction?
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by affiliates of private real estate
funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. pursuant to the merger agreement. Once the
merger proposal has been approved by the holders of our common stock and the other closing conditions under
the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, at the company merger effective time Merger Sub I will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Company. For additional
information about the merger, please review the full text of the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement
as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the merger.
As a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?
If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $6.768 per share in cash for each share of our Class A
common stock issued and outstanding that you own as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time
and $6.699 per share in cash for each share of our Class T common stock issued and outstanding that you own as
of immediately prior to the company merger effective time, in each case without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes.
What will happen to the Company’s Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Redemption Plan?
In connection with the merger, on May 5, 2022 our board of directors approved the continued suspension of the
Company’s distribution reinvestment plan (the “Distribution Reinvestment Plan”) and share redemption plan.
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
If we obtain the requisite stockholder approval for the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to
the merger are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the merger will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place on the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the parties’ various obligations to effect the merger (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the closing of the merger), or such other date as agreed in writing by the parties to
the merger agreement; provided, however, that in no event will the closing of the merger be required to occur prior
to the earlier of (i) a date specified by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II on no less than three
business days’ written notice to the Company and (ii) October 21, 2022.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger proposal is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. Instead, we will remain an independent company, our common stock will continue to be registered
under the Exchange Act, and our common stock, Series B preferred stock, RSU awards and warrants will remain
outstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances we will be required to pay
the Parent Entities the Company termination fee or the expense reimbursement payment, and in certain other
circumstances the Parent Entities will be required to pay us the Parent termination fee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the common stock merger consideration for my shares?
Our stockholders will receive payment in the form of a check to your address of record or paid to alternate
distribution instructions if established on the account. If shares are held in a custodial or broker-controlled
account, payment will be made to the custodian or broker, as applicable.
When and where is the special meeting?
The special meeting will be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format.
To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM.
Who can vote and attend the special meeting?
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022,
are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment
thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting
for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were
229,163,176 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
How do I attend the virtual special meeting?
The special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. You will
not be able to physically attend the special meeting. To access the virtual special meeting via live webcast,
stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. The virtual special meeting will start
promptly at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, and online access will begin at 8:45 a.m., Central Time. To log in to the virtual
special meeting, you will be required to enter a control number (included on your proxy card, voting instruction
form or other notice that you may receive), which will allow you to participate in the virtual special meeting and
vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for the merger
proposal is based on the number of votes that our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the
number of votes cast, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your shares at the virtual special
meeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on
how to vote, will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on
the proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your
shares at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor,
bank or other nominee on how to vote, will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
What vote of common stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
For the purpose of this proposal, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your shares at the
virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other
nominee on how to vote, will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Why is my vote important?
If you do not authorize your proxy to vote your shares or do not vote your shares at the virtual special meeting, or
you do not instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will be more difficult
for the Company to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the merger
proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority
of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal, your failure to authorize your proxy or to vote at the
virtual special meeting, or your failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to
vote, will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
How does the common stock merger consideration compare to our net asset value?
The common stock merger consideration represents a premium of more than 7.5% over our most recently published
estimated net asset value (“NAV”) of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per share of Class T
common stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
Why are holders of Class A common stock and holders of Class T common stock receiving different common stock merger
consideration?
The difference in the common stock merger consideration payable to holders of Class A common stock and Class T
common stock is attributable to the remaining amount of the stockholder servicing and distribution fees
attributable to the Class T common stock. The prices paid by purchasers of Class T common stock in our initial
and follow-on public offerings were lower than the purchase prices for Class A common stock because the selling
and distribution commissions payable in respect of Class T common stock were not paid at the time of the
purchase; instead, these commissions were payable over time. The continuing commission expenses were
allocated to the Class T common stock, as described in the prospectuses for our offerings. The Company paid the
commissions to the brokers for the holders of Class T common stock on their behalf and recouped such amounts
paid by paying lower dividends on the Class T common stock over the years. At the time that we stopped paying
dividends in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, there was a total of approximately $4,198,641 of
remaining expense allocated to the Class T common stock. That expense accounts for the difference between the
per Company A share merger consideration and the per Company T share merger consideration and was also
reflected in our most recently published estimated NAVs of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per
share of Class T common stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
As a holder of Series B preferred stock, what will I receive in the merger?
If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the applicable optional
redemption price, as determined in accordance with the Company’s Articles Supplementary governing the Series B
preferred stock, for each share of Series B preferred stock issued and outstanding that you own as of immediately
prior to the company merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.
What will happen to my restricted stock unit awards in the merger?
Effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each RSU award (whether vested or unvested)
outstanding as of immediately prior the company merger effective time will be cancelled, and in exchange you will
have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to
the RSU award immediately prior to the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share
merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How does our board of directors recommend that I vote?
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related
compensation payable to our named executive officers?
In July 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-
binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions, such as the merger.
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?
The vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve
the merger proposal. Approval of the advisory compensation proposal is a not a condition to completion of the
merger. The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on the
Company or our board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by
their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory
compensation proposal, if the merger is completed our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
Do any of the Company’s directors and executive officers have any interest in the merger that is different from mine?
Some of our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. See the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
for information about the interests that our directors and executive officers have in the merger that are different
from yours.
What do I need to do now?
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement (including the exhibits),
please vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described in this proxy statement as soon as
possible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of
the record date.
How do I cast my vote?
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or
authorize a proxy to vote your shares at the virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing,
signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope.
Or, if you prefer, you can authorize your proxy by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or
Internet proxy authorization: registered stockholders can transmit your voting instructions by telephone by calling
(800) 690-6903 or through the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. Telephonic and Internet voting are available 24
hours per day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the day immediately before the date of the special meeting. Have
your proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. If the
telephonic or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less
costly.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in “street name”?
If you own common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you
must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on your voting instruction form that you may
receive from your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, since brokers, financial advisors, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this
proxy statement. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such
voting instructions, contact your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on
how to vote your shares. If you hold your common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other
nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor,
from the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
With respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting
or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, financial
advisor, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. With
respect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to
cast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give
voting instructions to your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the
outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
How will proxy holders vote my shares of common stock?
If you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as
you direct. If you authorize a proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted “FOR” the
merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to
our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special
meeting.
What happens if I sell my common stock before the special meeting?
If you held common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain
your right to vote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock merger consideration for
such shares. The right to receive the common stock merger consideration when the merger becomes effective will
pass to the person who owns the shares you previously owned.
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
Yes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized
proxy at any time before it is exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly
authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the
virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have
instructed a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for
changing your vote do not apply and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, financial
advisor, bank or other nominee to change your vote.
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
Yes. The receipt of the common stock merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the common
stock merger consideration you receive and your adjusted tax basis in your common stock. In addition, if a
stockholder fails to provide a completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9, we or the Parent Entities generally are
required to withhold 15% of the common stock merger consideration otherwise payable to such stockholder
pursuant to FIRPTA, and a stockholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise qualify for an
exemption may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at a rate of 24% of the common stock merger
consideration otherwise payable to such stockholder. See the section entitled “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax

consequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will
depend on your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax
consequences of the merger to you.
What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?
If you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are
not, however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder
to receive the fair value of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the
MGCL, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of
directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of
directors has not made such a determination. See the section entitled “No Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal.”
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current
Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the
SEC are publicly available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov when filed.
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?
If you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your
proxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.
Where can I find more information about the Company?
We file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our
website at www.watermarklodging.com. The information contained on or otherwise accessible through our website
is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form a part of, this proxy statement or any other report or
document we file with or furnish to the SEC. You can also request copies of these documents from us. See the
section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be
solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, email or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other
employees, for which they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged Broadridge Investor
Communication Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately
$106,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify Broadridge
against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in
their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others, to send (or cause to be sent)
proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such holders for their
reasonable expenses in so doing.

PROPOSAL 1 
MERGER PROPOSAL
We are asking our common stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the
Company.
For detailed information regarding the merger proposal, see the information about the merger and the merger agreement
throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Merger” and “The
Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.
Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority
of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through
the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on this Proposal 1, your shares
will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors, which is “FOR” this Proposal 1. Because the
required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather
than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special
meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker on how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as
voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Approval of the merger proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. In the event the merger proposal is not
approved, the merger cannot be completed.
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

PROPOSAL 2 
ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act, we are asking our common stockholders to vote at the special meeting on an advisory basis regarding the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the mergers. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K concerning this compensation, subject to
certain assumptions described therein, is presented in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits.”
The stockholder vote on this advisory compensation proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on the
Company or our board of directors. The underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject
to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is completed, then in
accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation, our named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger.
We are asking our common stockholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc.’s common stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Watermark
Lodging Trust, Inc. that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits”  (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute

Date, Time and Purpose of the Special Meeting
This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of
directors to be exercised at a special meeting to be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only
meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting via live webcast, stockholders should visit
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. To log in to the virtual special meeting, you will be required to enter a
control number (included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive), which will
allow you to participate in the virtual special meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of
the record date.
At the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to act on the following matters:
Proposal 1:
To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company;
Proposal 2:
To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger; and
Proposal 3:
To consider and vote on a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger
proposal.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special
meeting.
A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully
in its entirety.
Record Date, Notice and Quorum
All holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are
entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each
holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of
common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were 229,163,176 shares of our
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Holders of our Series B preferred stock are entitled
to receive notice of the special meeting but are not entitled to attend or vote at the special meeting, and no vote or proxy is
being solicited from such holders.
The presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be
cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special
meeting via the special meeting website constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A
quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the
special meeting will be adjourned to a later date that is not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to
restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the
Parent Entities’ written consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was
originally scheduled).
Required Vote
Completion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common
stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for
the merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the
number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting (including
by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For
the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special
meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect
on the outcome of such proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the
outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.
Accordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must complete and return the
enclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or attend the virtual
special meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately
1,067,169 shares of common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.47% of the voting power of our common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the
shares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and
in favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.
Votes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of
election for the special meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock
represented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.
How to Authorize a Proxy
Holders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following
methods:
mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail;
authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions
included with your proxy card; or
attend the virtual special meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.
Regardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares
of common stock as described above as promptly as possible.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee are represented at a
meeting, but the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary
voting power on other proposals at such meeting. If you own common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or
other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on your
voting instruction form that you may receive from your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, since brokers,
financial advisors, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the
proposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on
how to vote your shares, following the directions contained in your voting instruction form. If you have not received such
voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, financial advisor,
bank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your common stock through a
broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a “legal
proxy,” executed in your favor, from the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).
Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes that our common stockholders are
entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the
virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on
how to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Because the approval of the
advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast on such proposal, and because your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary
authority to vote on either proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special
meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect
on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

Proxies and Revocation
If you authorize a proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If
no voting instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted in
accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR”
the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
You may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three
ways:
by delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date
of the proxy that is being revoked to our Corporate Secretary at Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc., 150 N.
Riverside Plaza, Suite 4200, Chicago, Illinois 60606;
by delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by
telephone or by Internet at a date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares
of common stock; or
by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.
Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own
shares of common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, you may revoke or change previously
granted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee
that is the registered owner of the shares.
Pursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special
meeting.
Solicitation of Proxies
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be
solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, email or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for
which they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged Broadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies
for a fee of approximately $106,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to
indemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations
holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others, to send (or cause to
be sent) proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such holders for their
reasonable expenses in so doing.
Adjournments
Our bylaws permit the chair or co-chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action
by our stockholders, to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the special
meeting. In such case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice (other than by an announcement made
at the special meeting) unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original record date or if, after the
adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of or to vote at the special meeting (subject to restrictions in the
merger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities’ written
consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).
Postponements
At any time prior to convening the special meeting, we may postpone the special meeting for any reason without the
approval of our common stockholders (subject to restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain
circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities’ written consent, be held on a date that is more than
30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).

acquire the Company and our subsidiaries, through the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Company, and the merger of Merger Sub II with and into the Partnership, with the

exchange all of their Class A common stock, Class T common stock, Series B preferred stock and Class A OP units in the
merger or the partnership merger, as applicable, for the applicable cash consideration and the Company and our
subsidiaries will be owned by the Parent Entities. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Common
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, RSU Awards and Warrants” and “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Partnership Units”
for more information.
Background of the Merger
As part of its ongoing oversight, direction and management of the Company, our board of directors and management team
regularly review and discuss the Company’s performance, business plan, strategic direction and future prospects. In
particular, our board of directors and management have been focused for some time on obtaining value for stockholders by
positioning the Company for a successful liquidity event, given the Company’s status as a non-traded REIT and the fact
that, in connection with the initial public offerings of our predecessors, Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (“CWI 1”)
and Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (“CWI 2”), CWI 1 and CWI 2 expressed their intentions to begin
considering alternatives for providing liquidity for stockholders beginning not later than the sixth anniversary of the
termination of their respective initial public offerings, which terminations occurred in 2013 (CWI 1) and 2017 (CWI 2). In
April 2020, CWI 2 completed a merger with CWI 1 with a view to improving the combined company’s ability to execute a
successful liquidity event for stockholders. The merger created a company with greater scale, eliminated joint ventures
between CWI 1 and CWI 2, and made the combined company (renamed Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc.) self-managed, all of
which we believed would increase opportunities for stockholder liquidity.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States with full force around the time of the merger between CWI 1 and CWI 2 and
had a devastating impact on the travel and lodging industries. Our portfolio of hotels was materially adversely affected by
the pandemic. In response, we focused on reducing expenses, complying with safety mandates and engaging with lenders
and other counterparties to restructure payment obligations. By April 30, 2020, all of our 32 hotels had effectively ceased
operations, and we suspended dividends and our redemption program.
Against a backdrop of disruption and uncertainty, our board of directors and management team focused on shoring up our
liquidity and putting the Company on a footing to return to growth and profitability in the future. In July 2020, we drew
$200 million of new capital through the issuance of Series B preferred stock. As part of the transaction, we agreed to elect
two individuals designated by the holders of our Series B preferred stock to our board of directors. We also pursued asset
sales strategically to raise additional funds.
Most of our hotels gradually reopened in the second half of 2020, but the majority of them continued to operate at very low
occupancy levels into 2021. Our current 25 hotel portfolio Net Operating Income decreased from $198 million in 2019 to a
loss of $33 million in 2020; and Corporate EBITDA, adjusted for the internalization of management, decreased from $206
million in 2019 to a loss of $54 million in 2020. We cancelled or deferred planned renovations, temporarily suspended
funding certain reserves and entered into debt service deferrals on substantially all of our mortgage indebtedness. In
November 2020, we reported that our estimated NAVs per share of Class A common stock and per share of Class T common
stock were $5.51 and $5.45, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, which represented declines of over 50% from the
previously reported estimated NAVs of $11.41 per share of Class A common stock and per share of Class T common stock.
Our board of directors held a meeting on March 25, 2021, for the purpose of reviewing the Company’s business strategy.
Representatives of the Company’s management and Clifford Chance US LLP (“Clifford Chance”), the Company’s outside
corporate counsel, were present at the meeting. Management reported that demand from individual consumers was
improving at the Company’s resort hotels but that the urban hotels that cater to business travel, and group travel business
for all of the hotels, remained moribund. The consensus of our board of directors and management was that due to the
severe business downturn attributable to the pandemic, the uncertain outlook for a recovery in the lodging industry and
the operating losses that the Company was incurring due to the downturn, it would likely take several years for the
Company to
27 TABLE OF CONTENTS
recover the lost value in its portfolio, resume regular dividends and redemptions, and execute a stock exchange listing
and/or listed public offering at a reasonable valuation. Our board of directors and management concluded that it would be
prudent to explore the prospects for a capital raise or other strategic transaction that could enable the Company to make
progress on its objectives of returning to growth and profitability in the future and fulfilling our stated intention to provide
liquidity for stockholders, including possibly a transaction involving the investors that had purchased the Series B
preferred stock. Over the coming months, members of the Company’s management held informal conversations with
representatives of investment banking firms and representatives of the Series B preferred stock investors regarding the
prospects for a potential transaction.
Our board of directors held a meeting on June 15, 2021. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford
Chance were present at the meeting. At the meeting, management and the directors designated by the Series B preferred
stock investors provided an update on the preliminary work that the Series B preferred stock investors had undertaken
regarding a potential strategic transaction with the Company. A representative of Clifford Chance reviewed the directors’
duties in connection with the consideration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed a range of strategic alternatives that could be considered by a non-traded REIT to achieve stockholder
liquidity, including: a stock exchange listing, with or without a concurrent public offering; a cash sale or partial
recapitalization; a merger with an existing listed lodging company; and a conversion of the Company to a perpetual open-
end fund. Our board of directors concluded that management should continue to investigate the various alternatives,
which the board expected to consider alongside the alternative of remaining as an independent, non-traded REIT for the
foreseeable future.
Our board of directors held a meeting on September 14, 2021, during which the directors discussed the Company’s
business strategy. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance participated in the meeting. At
this time, all of the Company’s hotels were open, but the majority of them continued to experience significantly reduced
levels of occupancy. In particular, the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19 had set back the recovery that the
Company had been experiencing at some of our properties. At the meeting, the directors designated by the Series B
preferred stock investors informed the other directors that the Series B preferred stock investors would not put forth a
proposal for a strategic transaction with the Company, due to recent volatility in the capital markets and the required return
thresholds of their capital partners. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the directors potential strategic
alternatives for the Company. The directors, with input from representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford
Chance, discussed certain considerations with respect to the alternatives, including that: (i) continuing to operate as a
standalone public company in an uncertain environment would likely require the Company to sell additional hotels, seek
further debt restructuring and continue the suspension of dividends and redemptions for the foreseeable future; (ii) listed
hotel company valuations suggested that the trading value of the Company’s common stock in a direct listing or public
offering would likely be well below the most recent estimated NAVs per share; (iii) a strategic third-party investment could
assist with reducing the Company’s leverage and providing liquidity for some stockholders but would likely be expensive
and only an intermediate step that would not generate sufficient proceeds to address liquidity needs in full and provide
growth capital sufficient to add meaningful value; (iv) a sale of the Company for cash would provide near-term liquidity for
stockholders but would not enable them to participate in a future recovery of the Company’s portfolio; and (v) a strategic
merger with an existing listed hotel company would provide near-term liquidity and an opportunity for stockholders to
participate in a future recovery, but the Company’s leverage would likely be a concern to potential merger partners and a
merger partner’s ability to execute a sizable transaction would be limited by its cost of capital. The sense of the directors
was that in light of the uncertain outlook for the lodging industry, the fact that the Company would likely not resume
paying dividends or redeeming shares for the next few years if it remained independent, and the expectation that a capital
raise would be expensive or based on a heavily discounted valuation of the Company, it would be in the best interests of
stockholders for the Company to focus on strategic alternatives that would provide stockholders with liquidity in the near
term. After discussion, the directors concluded that management should undertake additional analysis of the alternatives
for both a cash sale and strategic merger.
Our board of directors continued its discussion of the Company’s business strategy at a meeting on September 28, 2021.
Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance participated in the meeting. Management reported on
recent business conditions and plans to address the Company’s debt maturities over the coming year. After discussion of
these matters and how they may impact the strategic alternatives that had been discussed at the previous meetings, the
directors requested that management develop a proposed timeline and strategy for approaching potentially interested
parties regarding a sale or other transaction that would result in liquidity for the Company’s stockholders. The directors
also authorized the chief executive officer to implement retention arrangements for key employees whose assistance would
be needed in connection with any process.
On October 20, 2021, our board of directors met to discuss the Company’s business strategy. Representatives of
management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed current
28 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
market conditions and a proposed process for soliciting indications of interest for a sale or other strategic transaction
involving the Company. Our board of directors discussed certain risks and benefits of commencing a process in which
parties would be invited to review confidential information and submit indications of interest with respect to a potential
transaction involving the Company, including risks related to potential disruptions to our business, loss of key employees
and the need to disclose proprietary and confidential information to current and potential competitors, and the benefits of
obtaining near-term liquidity and potential certainty of value for our stockholders. After discussion of the potential risks
and benefits of a process, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of our stockholders to take
steps to further explore a potential sale or other strategic transaction, including establishing a formal process involving
outreach to a number of potential transaction parties.
On November 11, 2021, we executed an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley formally retaining Morgan Stanley as the
exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with our board of directors’ evaluation of a possible transaction.
Our board of directors held meetings on December 8, 2021 and January 13, 2022. At each meeting, representatives of
management and Morgan Stanley updated the directors on the status of the transaction process. A representative of
Clifford Chance also attended the meetings. Between the beginning of the process in November 2021 and January 13, 2022,
representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted 41 potential bidders to participate in the process, including family offices,
sovereign funds and financial sponsors, 10 of which executed a confidentiality agreement with us by that date. Each bidder
that signed a confidentiality agreement was given access to an electronic data room containing customary due diligence
information regarding the Company and our properties. The parties that did not enter into a confidentiality agreement
indicated that they were not interested in pursuing a transaction with us at that time for various reasons, including, among
others, concerns regarding the potential size of the transaction, the expected pricing and associated return profile of the
transaction, concerns about the recovery prospects of the lodging industry and, for certain investors that are focused on
specific segments of the lodging market, the diversity of the portfolio. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed a list of
additional parties whom Morgan Stanley intended to contact and a timeline for receiving initial indications of interest from
interested bidders.
On February 9, 2022, we executed an engagement letter with Hodges Ward Elliott, Inc. to act as our real estate advisor and
to assist bidders to assess the value of our real property in connection with the transaction process.
On February 15, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley distributed to potential bidders an initial bid process letter. The
letter asked potential bidders to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest by March 14, 2022, for a potential
acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and Series B preferred stock. Each potential bidder was
informed that the Company’s invitation to participate in a second round of bidding would be based, in our sole discretion,
on a variety of factors, including the potential bidder’s proposed purchase price and an assessment of its ability to
complete the transaction expeditiously with minimal execution risk.
On March 16, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss, among other things, the written indications of interest
that we received. Members of our management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present.
The representatives of Morgan Stanley informed the directors that by that date, a total of approximately 64 investors had
been contacted and invited to participate in the process, 25 of which executed confidentiality agreements with the
Company, including Brookfield. The Company received 5 written indications of interest. The Morgan Stanley
representatives reviewed the initial indications of interest, noting that 4 indications of interest were received from financial
sponsors at valuations of the Company ranging from approximately $3.2 billion to approximately $3.6 billion (enterprise
value), resulting in prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.54 per share of common stock (including an all-cash proposal from
Brookfield at a price of $6.54 per share of common stock). The fifth proposal, also from a financial sponsor, was for a
management-led acquisition of the Company, including the Company’s ownership interest in certain properties. After
discussion, our board of directors determined that while none of the prices indicated was currently acceptable, the
indications of interest were in a range that could potentially be improved to an acceptable level through negotiation. The
directors authorized a second round of bidding with a select group of bidders, targeting definitive proposals in April 2022.
Following the meeting of our board of directors on March 16, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conducted
telephonic meetings with potential second-round participants. With input from our board of directors and management and
based on an assessment of each bidder’s ability to make a compelling offer and complete a merger with minimal execution
risk, three potential bidders were invited to participate in a second round of bidding, consisting of Brookfield and two
additional financial sponsors (which we refer to as “Bidder A” and “Bidder B”). Throughout March and April 2022, the
29 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
potential bidders continued to conduct due diligence on the Company, and 2 additional parties executed confidentiality
agreements with the Company.
On March 28, 2022 we reported that our estimated NAVs as of December 31, 2021, were $6.29 per share of Class A common
stock and $6.22 per share of Class T common stock.
On April 1, 2022, a second-round process letter and draft agreement and plan of merger (“draft merger agreement”) prepared
by Clifford Chance were made available in the data room. The initial draft merger agreement contemplated a customary all-
cash merger. The letter asked each of the bidders to submit definitive proposals by April 20, 2022, to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of our common stock and Series B preferred stock, which proposals were to include a mark-up of the
draft merger agreement, as well as to specify sources of financing, including commitment letters in final form.
Beginning on April 20, 2022, each of Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B submitted bid letters together with mark-ups of the
draft merger agreement and related transaction documents. Brookfield’s mark-up of the draft merger agreement
contemplated, among other things, equivalent company and reverse termination payments of $80 million, a requirement to
reimburse up to $20 million of Brookfield’s expenses if our stockholders did not approve the transaction at a duly convened
meeting, and the right of the Company to specifically enforce the merger agreement under certain circumstances.
On April 23, 2022, our board of directors met to discuss the potential sale transaction. Representatives of management,
Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the second-
round proposals received from Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B, including certain financial aspects of the proposals, and
updated our board of directors as to the discussions they had with each of the bidders. Representatives of Clifford Chance
reviewed with our board of directors the proposed terms of the mark-ups of the draft merger agreement with each of the
bidders, summarized the key execution risks and material open issues associated with each proposal, and suggested areas
for further negotiation.
With input from representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance, our board of directors continued to
compare the merits of the three bids. Our board of directors noted with favor that Brookfield’s all-cash offer of $6.54 per
share of common stock was the highest price offered, Brookfield had a proven ability to complete large acquisitions of
public companies in the real estate sector, and Brookfield’s transaction documentation was complete and reflected
committed financing. The directors noted certain areas for further improvement in Brookfield’s proposal, including the
amounts of the Company and reverse termination fees and the requirement to reimburse Brookfield for up to $20 million of
expenses if our stockholders did not approve the transaction at a duly convened meeting. Our board of directors also
discussed Bidder A’s proposal, which had a lower price of $6.00 per share of common stock but a higher reverse termination
payment, as well as the Company’s previous positive experience in negotiating and completing transactions with Bidder A.
After discussion of various advantages and disadvantages of the proposals from Brookfield and Bidder A, our board of
directors concluded that each of Brookfield and Bidder A should be requested to consider improving their respective offer
prices and other key terms and submit a final bid by April 26, 2022, while Bidder B’s offer price was considered to be too
low to warrant further negotiation.
Following the April 23 meeting, the Company’s chief executive officer had a discussion with representatives of each of
Brookfield and Bidder A in which he encouraged each of them to improve its offer price. He also proposed that Brookfield
reduce its proposed Company termination fee, increase its proposed reverse termination fee and eliminate the requirement
for the Company to reimburse up to $20 million of Brookfield’s expenses if the Company’s stockholders did not approve a
transaction. Each of Brookfield and Bidder A was instructed to submit a revised proposal by April 26, 2022.
On April 26, 2022, Brookfield submitted a revised proposal in which it increased the merger consideration to $6.75 per share
of common stock and increased the reverse termination fee to either $100 million or, if the Company had no specific
performance remedy, $130 million. Brookfield requested a one-week exclusivity period to negotiate the terms of a definitive
merger agreement. Bidder A did not submit a revised proposal.
On April 28, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss the sale process. Representatives of management,
Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on the second round of
bidding. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the directors, among other things, the current state of the
travel and lodging industry. Representatives of Clifford Chance reviewed the material terms of the final proposals from
Brookfield and Bidder A. The directors engaged in a discussion of the proposals. Our board of directors concluded that the
offer price of $6.75 per share of common stock was acceptable, subject to the finalization of other material terms on an
acceptable basis, and authorized management to enter into a one-week exclusive negotiating period with Brookfield and
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
seek to finalize the terms of a definitive agreement. Our board of directors also authorized management to engage in
discussions with Brookfield with respect to retention and severance arrangements.
Following the April 28 meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised Brookfield that the Company was willing to
enter into a one-week exclusive negotiating period. Representatives of Brookfield confirmed that Brookfield was willing to
move forward on that basis. On April 29, 2022, Brookfield and the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement.
From April 29, 2022 to May 6, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP
(“Fried Frank”), counsel to Brookfield, exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
Representatives of Clifford Chance and Fried Frank had several calls to resolve open issues on the draft merger agreement
and, thereafter, continued to exchange further revised drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.
During that time, the key issues negotiated with Brookfield with respect to the draft merger agreement and related
agreements included, among other things, the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, the restrictions on
the conduct of our business until completion of the transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, our ability to
participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties relating to unsolicited acquisition proposals, the outside date
after which either party may terminate the merger agreement, the remedies available to the parties, the circumstances in
which expense reimbursement would be payable by the Company, the amounts of the termination payments and expense
reimbursement, the treatment of employees and implementation of retention and severance arrangements, and a term sheet
for a potential advisory agreement requested by Brookfield with Watermark Capital Partners, LLC (“Watermark Capital
Partners”), which owns a 1.0% capital interest in the Partnership and is 100% owned by Mr. Michael Medzigian, our Chief
Executive Officer. In addition, the Company advised Brookfield that its $6.75 per share offer price should be adjusted as
between the Class A common stock and the Class T common stock to account for the remaining amount of the stockholder
servicing and distribution fees allocated to the Class T common stock (the “Paid Broker Dealer Fees”), resulting in merger
consideration of $6.768 per share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share of Class T common stock.
On May 5, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss the final terms of the proposed transaction with
Brookfield. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Venable
LLP, special Maryland counsel to the Company, also were present and reviewed with our board of directors the directors’
duties in connection with a potential sale of the Company. Our board of directors also discussed (1) proposed retention
and severance arrangements to motivate and retain employees and officers through the closing of the merger and for a
period of time thereafter and (2) the other interests of management in the mergers. Management and the representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance updated our board of directors on the discussions with Brookfield since the last board
meeting and described the changes in Brookfield’s offer, noting, among other things, the following: the per share merger
consideration was adjusted as between the Class A common stock and Class T common stock, the reverse termination fee
was increased from $130 million to $150 million, and the expense reimbursement was reduced from $20 million to $10 million.
Representatives of Clifford Chance also provided a presentation to our board of directors regarding the terms of the merger
agreement and related transaction documents.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley next reviewed the financial analyses supporting its fairness opinion. After discussion
among our board of directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion, dated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors to the effect that,
as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as described in Morgan Stanley’s written
opinion, and taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both (a) the merger consideration of $6.768 per share to be
received by holders of the Class A common stock and (b) the merger consideration of $6.699 per share to be received by
holders of the Class T common stock (other than holders of excluded common shares) pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company’s common stock.
After further discussion of the merits of the mergers, and taking into account the various factors described below in greater
detail under the section entitled “-Reasons for the Merger,” including our board of directors’ belief that the mergers are
more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to us, including remaining as an independent
public company and listing our common stock, our board of directors voted unanimously to adopt resolutions which,
among other things, determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
authorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and directed that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common stock of
the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the course of the day on May 6, 2022, the parties finalized the transaction documents and a proposed form of press
release announcing the execution of the merger agreement. Subsequently on May 6, 2022, the Company, the Partnership
and affiliates of private real estate funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield executed the merger agreement and all
signatories to the equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter (and related fee letter) and limited guarantee executed
such agreements.
In the afternoon of May 6, 2022, we issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.
Reasons for the Merger
In reaching the unanimous decision to (1) determine and declare that the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (2) authorize and approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, and (3) direct that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common
stock at the special meeting, our board of directors consulted with members of our management, as well as our financial and
legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors which our board of directors
viewed as supporting its decision:
we conducted a thorough and diligent process, inviting approximately 64 potential bidders to participate in
the process, of which 27 potential bidders executed confidentiality agreements with the Company in order to
conduct due diligence, and only Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B engaged in significant negotiations with
us during the 2022 process;
at the conclusion of the sale process, Brookfield’s offer price was the highest received by the Company;
our board of directors’ belief that, in light of our thorough and diligent sale process, the feedback we received
from participants in the process regarding their ability to pay sufficiently attractive merger consideration and
the definitive proposals submitted by Brookfield and Bidder A, it was unlikely that any other party would be
willing to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for common stock merger consideration in excess of
the consideration offered to be paid by Brookfield, and that further extending the deadline for proposals or
otherwise soliciting other potential buyers would not yield proposals of greater value or with increased
certainty of closing;
the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and
liquidity immediately upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer
potential timeline for realizing equivalent value from our standalone business plan or other possible strategic
alternatives such as asset sales or a third-party capital investment;
the merger consideration was the result of arm’s-length negotiations between us and Brookfield, including
price increases from the price in Brookfield’s initial indication of interest received on April 20, 2022, of $6.54
per share of our common stock, and our board of directors’ belief that the merger consideration represented
the highest price that Brookfield was willing to pay;
the common stock merger consideration represents a premium of more than 7.5% over our most recently
published estimated NAVs of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per share of Class T common
stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021;
our board of directors’ knowledge of our business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, as
well as knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which we operate, including uncertainties
relating to the resurgence of variants of COVID-19, inflation, predictions of a recession, increasing financing
costs, stock market declines, and the fact that interest rates have begun to rise and are expected to continue
to rise;
the risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company and being able to raise new equity
capital, reduce leverage, expand our portfolio through acquisitions, and resume paying dividends and
redeeming shares;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the belief that the merger is more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to
us, including remaining as an independent public company and listing our common stock on a national
securities exchange, the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated
with pursuing such alternatives;
the high probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things, Brookfield’s
substantial available capital, proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions and extensive
experience in the real estate industry, the lack of a financing condition, and the $150 million Parent termination
fee payable to us if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed
by the Sponsors;
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by our board of directors with our
financial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations
between the parties;
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to our board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed in
writing by the delivery of a written opinion, dated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors, that as of such date
and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written
opinion, and taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both the per Company A share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of Class T common stock (in each case, other than the excluded
common shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of
the Company’s common stock (as more fully described in the section entitled “-Opinion of Our Financial
Advisor-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”);
our ability under the merger agreement, in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish
information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain circumstances;
the fact that the $50 million Company termination fee payable by us in certain circumstances was viewed by
our board of directors, after consultation with our financial advisor and our outside legal advisor, as
reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a competing proposal;
our board of directors’ ability, under certain circumstances, to (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify its
recommendation that our stockholders approve the merger proposal, subject to payment of the $50 million
Company termination fee if the Parent Entities elect to terminate the merger agreement in such circumstance,
or (ii) terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of a superior proposal, subject to payment of the $50 million Company termination fee; and
the fact that the merger would be subject to the stockholder approval, and holders of our common stock
would be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were
to be made prior to the special meeting (although we may be required to pay the $50 million Company
termination fee under certain circumstances if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to, or to consummate, a competing proposal and we may be required to reimburse Brookfield for up to
$10 million of expenses).
Our board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:
our inability to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the $50 million Company termination fee
payable upon the termination of the merger agreement could discourage other potential bidders from making a
competing proposal to acquire the Company;
following the merger, we will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders
will not participate in any future earnings or growth that we might have achieved on a standalone basis or as
a combined company;
the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to
our stockholders than the proposed merger with Brookfield;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions
precedent to the closing of the merger, including the risk that our stockholders do not approve the merger
proposal;
the possibility that we will have to reimburse Brookfield for up to $10 million of expenses if our stockholders
do not approve the merger at the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof;
if any of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy its obligations
under the merger agreement, we are not entitled to specifically enforce the merger agreement, the equity
commitment letter or the debt commitment letter, and if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances, our sole and exclusive remedy for losses or damages suffered by us or by our affiliates or
representatives, in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, would be limited to receipt of the $150 million Parent termination fee (the payment of which is
guaranteed by the Sponsors), other than certain litigation expenses in enforcing our right to the Parent
termination fee and certain indemnification and reimbursement rights;
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or
prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger;
an all-cash merger would be taxable to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
under Maryland law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or similar rights of
an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger;
the significant costs involved in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, and performance of
the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the
substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the merger, and the related disruptions to
the operation of our business;
the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or the failure to
complete the merger, may have an adverse impact on our employees and our existing and prospective
business relationships with third parties; and
some of our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally (see “-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by our board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but rather
includes the material factors considered by our board of directors. In reaching the unanimous decision to authorize and
approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board of
directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors
considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Our board of directors did not
reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.
The foregoing discussion of the factors is not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and the
reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
Our board of directors has unanimously:
determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders;
authorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; and

directed that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common stock at the
special meeting.
Our board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the advisory compensation proposal and
“FOR” the adjournment proposal.
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance due to, among other things, the inherent
difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and
estimates may not be realized. However, in connection with our evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and
specifically the merger, our management prepared certain forward-looking financial projections for the Company on a
consolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, through December 31, 2026 (the “Company financial
projections”).
The following table summarizes the Company financial projections that were provided to our board of directors, to certain
bidders, including Brookfield, and to Morgan Stanley, and which our board of directors directed Morgan Stanley to use and
rely upon in connection with Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis and opinion rendered to our board of directors, as
described in the section entitled “ -Opinion of Our Financial Advisor.”

Important Information About the Company Financial Projections
The Company financial projections are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain information that was
made available to our board of directors, Morgan Stanley and certain bidders, including Brookfield, and used by Morgan
Stanley in connection with its financial analysis and fairness opinion. The Company financial projections have not been
updated following April 11, 2022, to reflect our current views of our future financial performance, and they should not be
treated as guidance with respect to projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, or any other period. The
Company financial projections are subjective in many respects and were prepared solely for our internal use, to assist
prospective bidders in connection with their due diligence review, and for Morgan Stanley for use in connection with its
financial analysis and fairness opinion. The Company financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public
disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information, or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Our independent
registered public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited, or performed any procedures with respect to the
Company financial projections and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this
information or its achievability. The inclusion of the Company financial projections in this proxy statement does not
constitute an admission or representation by us that the information is material.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The above financial data were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hotel EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Corporate
EBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that we use in analyzing our financial results
and believe that they enhance investors’ understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our results to
prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial
information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from others in
the industry and Hotel EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Corporate EBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not
necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were
not relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion to our board of directors (as described below in the section
entitled “-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor”) or by our board of directors or Brookfield in connection with their
consideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures
included in the Company financial projections.
In the view of our management, the Company financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting
management’s best available estimates and judgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were
prepared.
The Company financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables,
estimates and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,
competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which
are beyond our control. The Company financial projections were developed under the assumption of continued standalone
operation, do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the
Company financial projections were prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or
any effects of the merger. Further, the Company financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of
the merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Company financial
projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the Company
financial projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive
year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Company financial projections include,
but are not limited to, local market conditions, general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital,
credit or securities markets, developing industry dynamics, competition, our ability to obtain financing, development and
redevelopment costs, changes in business strategy and those additional risks and factors discussed in reports filed with
the SEC by the Company from time to time, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s
most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other
reports filed with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may cause our future financial results to materially
vary from the projections summarized above, see the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements.”
The Company financial projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in general
business or economic conditions, certain accounting assumptions, timing of business investments, changes in actual or
projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax or other laws or regulations or any other transaction or
event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the Company financial projections were
prepared. In addition, the Company financial projections may be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from
those contained in the Company financial projections. The Company financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our public filings with the SEC.
There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Company financial projections will be realized or that future
actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Company financial projections.
The inclusion of the Company financial projections and accompanying narrative in the tables above should not be
regarded as an indication that the Company, Brookfield, our or its respective affiliates, or our, its or their respective officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives, consider the Company financial projections to be necessarily predictive of
actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company, Brookfield, our or its
respective affiliates, or our, its or their respective officers, directors, advisors or other representatives, gives any of our
stockholders or any other person any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Company financial
projections; and the Company, Brookfield, our and its respective affiliates, and our, its and their respective officers,
directors, advisors and other representatives, undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
Company financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the dates on which the Company financial projections
were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and
estimates underlying the Company financial projections are shown to be in error or are no longer appropriate. Some or all of
the assumptions that have been
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
made in connection with the preparation of the Company financial projections may have changed since the date the
Company financial projections were prepared. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the
Company financial projections. None of the Company, our affiliates, or our or their respective officers, directors, advisors
or other representatives, has made or makes any representation to any of our stockholders regarding our ultimate
performance compared to the information contained in the Company financial projections or that the Company financial
projections will be achieved.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Company financial projections, our stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Company financial projections.
Opinion of Our Financial Advisor
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
The Company retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with a possible
strategic transaction, and, if requested by the Company, a financial opinion with respect thereto. The Company selected
Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation in the
Company’s sector and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company, and its substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger. Morgan Stanley rendered to the Company’s board of directors at a meeting on May 5,
2022, its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion, dated May 6, 2022,
that as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the
written opinion, and taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees (as defined below), both the per Company A share
merger consideration to be received by the holders of Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of Class T common stock (in each case, other than the excluded common
shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company’s
common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated May 6, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit B and hereby
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley
in rendering its opinion. Stockholders are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion is directed to the Company’s board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the consideration to be received by the
holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the
Company’s common stock as of the date of the opinion. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Morgan Stanley’s engagement and its opinion were for the benefit of
our board of directors (in its capacity as such), and Morgan Stanley’s opinion was rendered to our board of directors in connection
with its evaluation of the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and was not intended to, and does not, constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote or act at the special meeting to be held or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the
Company;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with
senior executives of the Company;
reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
merger, prepared by the management of the Company;
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company,
including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
merger, with senior executives of the Company;
compared the financial performance of the Company with that of certain other publicly traded companies
comparable with the Company, and their securities;
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Parent
Entities and their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed the merger agreement, the draft commitment letters from certain lenders and financing sources
substantially in the form of the drafts dated April 19, 2022 and April 20, 2022, respectively, and certain related
documents; and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by
the Company and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information
relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the mergers, Morgan Stanley assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed
that the mergers would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that the Parent Entities would obtain
financing in accordance with the terms of the commitment letters, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ
in any material respect from the May 5, 2022 draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the
proposed mergers, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed mergers. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment by the management of the Company of: (i) the strategic, financial and other
benefits expected to result from the mergers; and (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company
and the Parent Entities. Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and the opinion did not address, any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith, including, without
limitation, any terms, aspects or implications of any related transactions. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory
advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of
the Company and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received by any of the
Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by
the holders of
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of the Company’s common stock (other than the holders of the excluded common shares). Morgan Stanley also
expressed no opinion as to the relative or standalone fairness of any portion of the consideration to be received by holders
of any separate class of Company’s common stock. In addition, Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the
fairness of the amount or nature of the consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement by holders of
restricted stock units in the Company, Series B preferred stock of the Company, Class A OP units of the Partnership, or any
other equity interests of the Company or the Partnership, except for the holders of shares of Company’s common stock
(other than the holders of the excluded common shares). Morgan Stanley was advised by the Company that the Company
has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its
formation as a REIT and Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers would not adversely affect such status or operations of
the Company. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Company, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was
necessarily based on financial, economic, market, tax and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to them as of, May 6, 2022. Events occurring after May 6, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the
assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this
opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral
opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Company’s board of directors dated May 6, 2022. The
following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan
Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight
given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in
the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors
reviewed, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is
not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.
For purposes of Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the analyses described below, the Company advised Morgan Stanley that
the Company had paid distribution and servicing fees to broker dealers on behalf of the holders of Class T common stock
in an amount equal to approximately $4,198,641 (the “Paid Broker Dealer Fees”), and as a result of the reimbursement of
such Paid Broker Dealer Fees to the Company, the per Company T share merger consideration was less than the per
Company A share merger consideration by $0.069 per share. For additional information relating to the adjustment to the per
share merger consideration relating to fees attributable to the Class T common stock, see the section entitled “Questions
and Answers About the Special Meeting and the Merger.”
Net Asset Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley analyzed the value of the Company as a function of the net value of its assets. Morgan Stanley based its
net asset value analysis on our management’s publicly disclosed estimates of net asset value as of December 31, 2021.
Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated net asset value per share of the Company’s common stock based on the
published appraisal performed by CBRE Hotels and estimates of the fair market value of Company debt provided by Robert
A. Stanger & Co. As discussed and agreed with Company management, Morgan Stanley adjusted such estimated net asset
value per share to account for exercising the call option that will allow the Company to purchase warrants, Class A OP units
received upon exercise of warrants, and shares of Class A common stock issued upon redemption of such Class A OP units.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley separately calculated an adjusted estimated net asset value per share that deducted the
estimated costs required to consummate the transactions (based on the Parent Entities’ cost estimate of approximately $143
million). An implied per share equity value reference range for the Company was then calculated based on the range of net
asset values derived from such analyses divided by the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock
outstanding. These analyses indicated the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for each share of
Company common stock:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range
Published NAV
$6.29 per share of Class A common stock 
$6.22 per share of Class T common stock
Adjusted NAV
$6.50 per share of common stock (blended)
Adjusted NAV Net of Transaction Costs
$5.89 per share of common stock (blended)

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the Company, which is designed to provide an implied value
of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and the terminal value of
the company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values as of September 30, 2022 for the shares of the
Company’s common stock. Morgan Stanley used estimates from the Company’s financial forecasts for purposes of its
discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the stub period from September 30, 2022
through fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2026, and a terminal year of 2027 (determined in accordance with the
Company’s model) (the “Unlevered Free Cash Flow”), which it calculated by deducting from Corporate EBITDA for each
such fiscal year net capital expenditures and making certain further investment adjustments. The estimates of Unlevered
Free Cash Flow were based on the Company’s financial forecasts.
Morgan Stanley then discounted the estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flow to present value as of September 30, 2022, using
rates based on Morgan Stanley’s judgment of the estimated range of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital of
8.7% to 9.5%, to derive ranges of implied enterprise values for the Company. From the ranges of implied enterprise values,
Morgan Stanley then deducted the Company’s projected net debt of approximately $1.732 billion as of September 30, 2022,
the liquidation value of preferred equity, and the proposed amount required for exercising the call option that will allow the
Company to purchase warrants, Class A OP units received upon exercise of warrants, and shares of Class A common stock
issued upon redemption of such Class A OP units, to arrive at a range of implied equity values for the Company, which
implied equity values were subsequently divided by the number of fully diluted shares of the Company’s common stock to
derive a range of implied share prices as of September 30, 2022, which ranges were adjusted to reflect sensitizing
incremental projected capital expenditure spend during the period analyzed that could be required to maintain and improve
performance based on third party data sources and guidance from the Company’s management.
This analysis implied the following ranges of per share equity value for the Company’s common stock:

Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which is designed to provide an implied trading value of
a company by comparing it to selected companies with similar characteristics to the Company. Morgan Stanley reviewed
and compared certain financial information of the Company with publicly available information, including publicly available
market multiples, for a group of selected companies to derive an implied equity value reference range for the Company.
Morgan Stanley chose the following companies based on, among other things, knowledge of the lodging REIT industry
and the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to the company with respect to company portfolio,
size, asset type, asset quality and geographic exposure and other characteristics that Morgan Stanley deemed relevant.

For each of the following analyses performed by Morgan Stanley, financial and market data for the group of selected
companies were based on the most recent publicly available information and Street consensus estimates. Morgan Stanley
also analyzed for each of these companies the premium or discount represented by the ratio of share price to Street
consensus estimated net asset value per share.
With respect to the group of selected companies, the information Morgan Stanley presented included:
multiple of aggregate value to estimated EBITDA for 2022 (“Adj. AV / 2022E EBITDA”);
multiple of aggregate value to estimated EBITDA for 2023 (“Adj. AV / 2023E EBITDA”); and
premium / discount to research consensus net asset value (“NAV Premium / (Discount)”).

For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 based on the Company’s
financial projections and publicly reported NAV as of December 31, 2021. The multiples and premium or discount to NAV
for each of the selected companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on April 29, 2022. Based on the
analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected peer REITs, Morgan Stanley selected a range of multiples and
percentages based on top and bottom quartiles and applied this range of multiples and percentages to the relevant
financial statistics for the Company to derive separate implied per share equity value references ranges for the Company
common stock.
Morgan Stanley estimated the implied per share equity value of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2022, as
follows:

No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the group of selected
companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, such as
the impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of
any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the financial
markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method
of using comparable company data.
Select Precedent M&A Transactions Analysis
Using publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected precedent (i) transactions with a deal
value in excess of $500 million announced since 2015, in which the targets were lodging REITs that operate in and/or were
exposed to similar lines of business as the Company, and (ii) privatizations of publicly traded U.S. REITs with deal value in
excess of $500 million since 2010. The following table sets forth the selected transactions considered, including their
respective dates of announcement:

Morgan Stanley reviewed for each of the transactions listed above for the multiple of aggregate value over next twelve
months EBITDA. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available Street consensus estimates,
public filings and other publicly available information at the time of the relevant transaction announcement. Morgan
Stanley selected the 25th and 75th percentiles of multiples for the relevant transactions and applied these ranges of
multiples to the relevant financial statistics for the Company to estimate the implied per share equity value of shares of the
Company’s common stock as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
The following presents the results of this analysis:

Morgan Stanley also analyzed the premium or discount to Street consensus net asset values for precedent REIT take-
private transactions with deal value in excess of $500 million since 2010. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley
adjusted the reported net asset values of the Company to adjust for the proposed execution of the call option of
outstanding Company warrants. The resulting average implied premiums and discounts to NAV from the precedent
privatization transactions were applied to the Company’s Adjusted NAV, resulting in the following range of implied per
share equity values of shares of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2022:

No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the selected precedent transactions analysis is identical to the
Company, nor are the transactions identical to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In evaluating the
transactions listed above, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control,
such as the impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally, industry growth and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the
financial markets in general, which could affect the value of the Company and the aggregate value of the transactions to
which the merger is being compared. Accordingly, mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not
in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.
General
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The
preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion
of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its
analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than
other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a
42 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan
Stanley’s view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions
and other matters which are beyond the Company’s control. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness of the per Company
A share merger consideration to be received by the holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and the per Company
T share merger consideration to be received by the holders of Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such
holders of the Company’s common stock as of the date of the opinion, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as
of May 6, 2022, to the Company’s board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals of the shares of
Company common stock. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how the Stockholders of the
Company should act or vote at the special meeting to be held or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.
The consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and the Parent Entities and
was approved by the Company’s board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company during these
negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific form, mix or amount of consideration to the Company, or that
any specific form, mix or amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business transaction, or
other alternatives, and expressed no opinion as to the relative or standalone fairness of any portion of the consideration to
the holders of any separate class of the Company’s common stock.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Company’s board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Company’s board of directors in deciding to adopt and approve the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby. See the section entitled “Reasons for the Merger.” Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Company’s board of directors
with respect to the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement or of whether the Company’s board of directors would have been willing to agree to different
consideration.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in
accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,
investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as
well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors
and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance
positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, the Parent Entities, their respective affiliates, or any other
company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, as compensation for its services relating to the merger, the Company has agreed
to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of up to approximately $37 million in the aggregate, $4 million of which was payable upon
announcement of the merger and up to approximately $33 million of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain of its expenses incurred in performing its
services, including certain fees of outside counsel. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and
its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley
or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws,
related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley’s engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of delivery of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates
provided financial advisory services to the Company and financial advisory and financing services for the Parent Entities
or their respective affiliates and have received fees from the Company of approximately $5-10 million and from the Parent
Entities and their affiliates of approximately $35-60 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek
to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Parent Entities, the Company and their respective affiliates in
the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financing
In connection with the closing of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Parent
Entities will cause an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion to be paid to the holders of common stock, Series B preferred
stock, RSU awards, warrants and Class A OP units (other than excluded shares). The Parent Entities have informed us that
they expect certain of our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of June 14, 2022, we had approximately
$2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated indebtedness outstanding, including mortgage loans and
mezzanine loans.
In connection with the merger agreement, the Parent Entities have entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders to
obtain debt financing in connection with the merger. Also in connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsors have
entered into an equity commitment letter to contribute equity to the Parent Entities for the purpose of funding the
acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.
The Parent Entities have informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained
from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing
debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the merger. The
Parent Entities have informed us that they currently believe that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt
financing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly
owned by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and
perfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being
completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.
The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a “market MAC” condition to the closing of the merger.
We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause our subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts, to cooperate as may be customary and reasonably requested by the Parent Entities to the extent
required in connection with the arrangement of debt financing. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Certain Other Covenants” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger.”
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote “FOR” the merger proposal and the other proposals in
this proxy statement, our stockholders should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have certain
interests in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board
of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the decision to authorize
and approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These
interests are discussed below.
RSU Awards
The merger agreement provides that effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each RSU award
(whether vested or unvested) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, outstanding
as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time will be cancelled, in exchange for the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to the RSU award immediately prior to
the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share merger consideration, less any applicable
withholding taxes.
As of June 14, 2022, our executive officers collectively owned 1,512,625 unvested RSU awards. The following table sets
forth the number of shares of common stock represented by unvested RSU awards held by our executive officers as of June
14, 2022, as well as the value of those shares based on the per Company A share merger consideration of $6.768 per share
of Class A common stock. As of June 14, 2022, none of our directors owned unvested RSU awards. All vested RSU awards
have previously been settled by the delivery of shares of Class A common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Summary of Terms: Transition Employment
On May 6, 2022, certain members of the Company’s management, including Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan
Medzigian and Samuel Zinsmaster, entered into a binding summary of terms with Merger Sub I (the “employment term
sheet”). Pursuant to the employment term sheet, Merger Sub I and each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian
and Zinsmaster agreed to negotiate and memorialize in good faith, within 30 days after the date of the employment term
sheet, definitive employment terms with the Company (and Brookfield, as applicable) for the duration of the interim period
and for a specified period of time following the closing of the mergers.
The employment term sheet contemplates, among other things:
Existing Retention/Severance. The Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. Employee Retention and Severance Plan,
effective November 2021 (“retention plan”), in which Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster each
participates pursuant to a participation agreement, effective as of November 11, 2021, will remain in effect as
of and following the closing of the mergers. Each such participation agreement provides that each of Messrs.
Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster will receive:
“retention benefits”  (as defined in the applicable participation agreement) in cash of $550,000 for Mr.
Brendan Medzigian and $400,000 for Mr. Zinsmaster-upon the earlier of (i) three months after the
closing of the mergers and (ii) a severance-eligible termination and
“severance amounts”  (as defined in the applicable participation agreement) of $866,667 for Mr.
Brendan Medzigian and $800,000 for Mr. Zinsmaster as provided for under the existing participation
agreements-upon a severance-eligible termination.
The employment agreement, executed October 22, 2019, by and between Michael G. Medzigian and Carey
Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (the “MGM employment agreement”) will be amended to provide that Mr.
Michael Medzigian will receive:
an amount equal to $7,531,875, which is the maximum amount of severance that would be available if
his employment were terminated other than for “Cause”  (as defined in the MGM employment
agreement)-upon a severance-eligible termination.
A “severance-eligible termination” means (1) termination of employment by the Company without “Cause” (as
defined in the retention plan or the MGM employment agreement, as applicable), (2) resignation from
employment by the applicable individual for “Good Reason”  (as defined in the retention plan or the MGM
employment agreement, as applicable), or (3) resignation from employment by the applicable individual during
the 30-day period following completion of the applicable service obligation (as defined below).
The “service obligation” means, with respect to Messrs. Michael Medzigian and Brendan Medzigian, the
three-month period, and with respect to Mr. Zinsmaster, the six-month period, in each case immediately
following (i) the closing of the mergers or (ii) the termination of the merger agreement, whichever is earlier.
Additional Retention/Transaction Bonuses. As expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, and as
disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered in connection therewith, the Company may provide retention
compensation and benefits of up to $4 million to employees during the interim period-of which $1.8 million will
be allocated to Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster as described below (in addition to the existing
retention and severance amounts described above) and $2.2 million will be allocated to employees other than
Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster. The employment term sheet contemplates
that prior to the closing of the mergers, each of Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster will enter into a
retention agreement (each, a “new retention agreement”) that is substantially similar in all material respects to
the “retention benefit” provisions of their participation agreements, as amended (as described above). The
new retention agreements will provide that Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster (as applicable) will
each receive (in addition to the existing retention and severance amounts described above):
a retention bonus of $900,000 in cash-within ten days following completion the applicable service
obligation.

280G Gross-up. Subject to the limitations in the employment term sheet, if the mergers are consummated, the
Company will provide a tax gross-up payment to each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and
Zinsmaster if any of them receives, or will receive, transaction-based payments that trigger excise taxes in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, under Section
4999 of the Code, the amount of which will be sufficient to put each such individual in the net after-tax
position that he would have been in had such excise taxes not become due and payable; provided that the
maximum gross-up payment for Mr. Michael Medzigian will be $3 million.
The table below under the section entitled “-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits” reflects the amount of
severance payments and benefits that our executive officers would be entitled to receive under the applicable employment
agreement upon termination of such executive officer’s employment by us without “Cause” or by the executive officer for
“Good Reason” following the mergers.
Summary of Terms: Advisory Agreement
On May 6, 2022, Watermark Capital Partners, which is 100% owned by Mr. Michael Medzigian, our Chief Executive Officer,
entered into a summary of terms with the Sponsors (the “advisory term sheet”). Pursuant to the advisory term sheet, if the
Sponsors in their sole discretion require Watermark Capital Partners to enter into an advisory agreement, the Sponsors and
Watermark Capital Partners agree to negotiate and attempt to agree, in good faith prior to the closing of the mergers, to the
terms of a definitive advisory agreement.
The advisory term sheet sets forth certain terms and conditions for the potential advisory agreement between Watermark
Capital Partners and the Sponsors (or an affiliate thereof) with respect to one or more real estate investment trusts to be
formed to hold interests in hotel properties owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. The advisory term sheet
contemplates, among other things: (i) certain services to be provided by Watermark Capital Partners to such REITs relating
to such hotel properties; (ii) an initial term of two years and, after one year, the right of each party to terminate the
agreement on not less than 60 days’ prior written notice; (iii) an annual fee of $1 million, and reimbursement of Watermark
Capital Partners’ reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in performing the services; and
(iv) mutual indemnification obligations of Watermark Capital Partners and Brookfield and such REITs.
Indemnification of Our Directors and Executive Officers
The merger agreement provides that from and after the company merger effective time, the Parent Entities will, and will
cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and our subsidiaries and each
fiduciary under the Company’s or any of our subsidiaries’ benefit plans (collectively, the “indemnified persons”), against (i)
all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, actions, suits, damages
or liabilities or, subject to certain exceptions, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the company merger effective time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the company
merger effective time), including in connection with the consideration, negotiation and approval of the merger agreement,
to the extent that such actions or omissions are based on or arise out of the fact that such indemnified person is or was a
director, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans, including any payment by the Surviving Company or the Surviving
Partnership on behalf of or advancement to such indemnified person of any expenses incurred by such indemnified person
in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement (collectively, the
“indemnified liabilities”), and (ii) all indemnified liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the company merger
effective time), including any expenses incurred by such indemnified person in connection with enforcing any rights with
respect to such indemnification and/or advancement.
The merger agreement also requires the Parent Entities to cause the Surviving Company to maintain our officers’ and
directors’ liability insurance policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement for at least six years after the closing of
the merger (or substitute policies with at least the same coverage and amounts, or “tail” policies on conditions that are no
less advantageous than the existing insurance policies). This requirement is subject to a maximum cost of 300% of our
current annual premiums paid for such insurance (the “maximum amount”). Also, if the cost of the annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the maximum amount, the Parent Entities and the
Surviving Company will procure and maintain the most advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the
maximum amount.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, the merger agreement provides that for at least six years from the company merger effective time, the
Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership will provide to the indemnified persons the same rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are provided to the indemnified persons under the Company’s and our
subsidiaries’ organizational documents in effect as of the date of the merger agreement. The Surviving Company and the
Surviving Partnership will assume specified contractual indemnification rights with any of the Company’s or our
subsidiaries’ current or former directors, officers or employees pursuant to specified agreements in existence on the date of
the merger agreement.
The parties have agreed not to terminate or modify these obligations set forth in the merger agreement regarding
indemnified persons in such a manner as to adversely affect such indemnified persons, and these obligations must be
assumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company as a result of any consolidation, merger, dissolution or
transfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits
The table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding
certain compensation which each of our “named executive officers” may receive that is based on or that otherwise relates
to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation in Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. This
compensation payable to our named executive officers is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of our common
stockholders as described above under the heading “Proposal 2: Advisory Compensation Proposal.”
The amounts in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below. The actual value to be received by our named
executive officers may be greater or less than the amounts presented below. The amounts in the table below do not reflect
any reduction in payments pursuant to the employment agreements to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of each
named executive officer’s merger-related payments and benefits from becoming subject to excise tax by reason of Section
4999 of the Code. For purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed, among other things:
November 7, 2022 (which is the outside date under the merger agreement) as the closing date of the mergers;
merger consideration of $6.768 per share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share of Class T common
stock; and
with respect to each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and Samuel Zinsmaster, the deemed
termination of each such named executive officer’s employment by us without “cause” in connection with
closing of the mergers.

payments. These amounts are “single trigger” payments that are paid on specified dates either before or after the closing
of the mergers and, in the case of severance payments, are subject to the executive fulfilling the applicable service
obligation and experiencing a severance-eligible termination.
These amounts represent the value of accelerated unvested RSU awards that will be cancelled and paid in cash on a
single trigger basis at the closing of the mergers.
This amount represents an estimate of the value of certain healthcare benefits that would be provided to Mr. Michael
Medzigian, pursuant to the MGM employment agreement, for 18 months following a qualifying termination of
employment by the Company. These benefits will be provided on a single trigger basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Regulatory Matters
We are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the
execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger for the merger by the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and the filing of the certificate of merger for the partnership merger with the
Secretary of State of Delaware.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of our common stock of
their receipt of the common stock merger consideration in exchange for the shares of our common stock pursuant to the
merger. This summary is not intended as tax advice. The tax treatment of a holder will vary depending upon the holder’s
particular situation, and this summary addresses only holders that hold shares of our common stock as capital assets and
does not deal with all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment or
tax circumstances. This summary also does not deal with all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of
holders to which special provisions of the U.S. federal income tax laws apply, including:
dealers in securities or currencies;
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for such traders’ securities
holdings;
banks and other financial institutions;
insurance companies;
tax-exempt organizations;
S corporations, REITs, regulated investment companies (“RICs”) or partnerships and other types of “flow-
through” entities (and investors therein);
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
persons that hold shares of our common stock that are a hedge, that are hedged against interest rate or
currency risks, or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction;
persons that purchase or sell shares of our common stock as part of a “wash sale” for tax purposes;
persons that acquired shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee options or otherwise
as compensation, including persons who are subject to Section 1061 of the Code with respect to gain from our
shares;
U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States; and
U.S. stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
This summary is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Code, published
rulings and court decisions. This summary describes the provisions of these sources of law only as they are currently in
effect. All of these sources of law may change at any time, and any change in the law may apply retroactively. Changes in
U.S. federal, state and local tax laws or regulations, with or without retroactive application, could have a negative effect on
the Company. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly
and negatively affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Company’s investors.
If a partnership holds shares of our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend
on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding shares of our
common stock should consult its tax advisor with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in the
shares and the partnership merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As used in this section, the term “U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, who, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is:
a citizen or resident of the U.S.,
a domestic corporation,
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the income’s source, or
a trust if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S.
persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
Beneficial owners of shares of common stock who are neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes are referred to in this section as “non-U.S. stockholders.”
ALL HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND APPLICABLE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
Tax Treatment of the Merger
The parties to the merger agreement intend that for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes, the
merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company will be treated as a taxable sale of the Company common stock to the
Parent Entities in exchange for the common stock merger consideration.
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Common Stockholders
The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, a U.S. stockholder whose shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in
the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding
taxes, as described below under “-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding”) and the U.S. stockholder’s adjusted
tax basis in such shares. A U.S. stockholder’s adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. stockholder paid for
the U.S. stockholder’s shares less any distributions received on such shares that were treated as returns of capital for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock held
by a U.S. stockholder (i.e., shares of our common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Any such capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss where the U.S. stockholder’s holding period for such shares of our
common stock is more than one year at the company merger effective time. Long-term capital gain of a noncorporate U.S.
stockholder generally is taxed at preferential rates. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.
The common stock merger consideration received by a U.S. stockholder in exchange for shares of our common stock
pursuant to the merger will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. stockholders generally will not be
able to apply any passive losses against that income or gain.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Common Stockholders
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below under “-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” a non-
U.S. stockholder should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on any gain or loss from the merger unless: (1) the
gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an
applicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S.
stockholder in the United States; (2) the non-U.S. stockholder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met; or (3) such shares constitute a “United States
real property interest” under FIRPTA.
A non-U.S. stockholder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States
will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. stockholder.
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as
may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described in clause (1) of the
previous paragraph.
A non-U.S. stockholder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
merger and who meets certain other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the merger,
which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the non-U.S. stockholder may be subject to applicable
alternative minimum taxes.
If a non-U.S. stockholder’s shares constitute a United States real property interest under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by
such holder in the merger will be subject to tax as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or
business of the non-U.S. stockholder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same
manner as income of a U.S. stockholder, although the above-described branch profits tax should not apply. A non-U.S.
stockholder’s common stock generally will not constitute a U.S. real property interest if (i) our common stock is regularly
traded on an established securities market, provided the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of our common
stock, or (ii) we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the company merger effective time. For this
purpose, a “qualified investment entity” includes a REIT. We do not believe that our common stock is regularly traded on
an established securities market as of the date of this proxy statement and therefore the 10% exception will not apply to a
non-U.S. stockholder of our common stock. Assuming we qualify as a REIT with respect to the taxable year that includes
the company merger effective time, we will be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the company
merger effective time if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of our common stock at all times
during the five-year period ending with the company merger effective time. Although we believe that we currently qualify
as domestically controlled, no assurance can be provided that we so qualify or will continue to so qualify at the company
merger effective time, and we currently expect that a 15% withholding tax will apply to the common stock merger
consideration paid to non-U.S. stockholders.
Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of
their particular circumstances.
Medicare Tax
A U.S. stockholder that is an individual or estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt
from such tax, is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. stockholder’s “net investment income”  (or
“undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust) for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of
the U.S. stockholder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of
individuals is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). A holder’s net investment
income generally includes the holder’s dividend income and the holder’s net gains from the disposition of shares of our
common stock, unless such dividends or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business
(other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). A U.S. stockholder that is an
individual, estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to such
holder’s income and gains in respect of such holder’s investment in our common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
A U.S. stockholder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding at the
applicable rate (currently 24%) with respect to the common stock merger consideration received pursuant to the merger,
unless such holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain holders (such as corporations and non-
U.S. stockholders) are exempt from backup withholding. Non-U.S. stockholders may be required to comply with
certification requirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and
backup withholding (generally, by providing a completed and duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8). Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited against a
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a
timely manner.
Possible Legislative Changes-Possible Change in Tax Rates
This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof, all as of the date of this proxy statement. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively,
so
50 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable tax rates) different from those summarized above.
We cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with retroactive
application, will not alter significantly the tax considerations (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We
have not sought and do not plan to seek any ruling from the IRS, with respect to statements made and the conclusions
reached in the above discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and
conclusions.
THE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS
RELATING TO THE MERGER AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO APPLICABLE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
Deregistration of Our Common Stock
If the merger is completed, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

The following summarizes the material provisions of the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be
complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The summary
of the material terms of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement. We recommend that you read the full text of the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not
by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by, and to, the Company, the Partnership, the
Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II. These representations and warranties, which are set forth in the copy of
the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A, were made for the purposes of negotiating and
entering into the merger agreement between the parties, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk
between the parties instead of establishing such matters as facts. In addition, these representations and warranties may
be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of
the merger agreement, may be made as of specified dates and for specified periods, and may be subject to standards of
materiality different from what may be viewed as material to our stockholders. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations and warranties, which does not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy
statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent developments or new information
may have been included in this proxy statement. You should not rely on the representations and warranties or any
descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, the Partnership or our
affiliates.
The Merger and the Partnership Merger
At the partnership merger effective time Merger Sub II will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership
continuing as the Surviving Partnership in the partnership merger. At the partnership merger effective time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Partnership and Merger Sub II will vest in the Surviving
Partnership, and all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Partnership and Merger Sub II will become the debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Partnership.
At the company merger effective time Merger Sub I will be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of
Merger Sub I will cease, and the Company will continue as the Surviving Company in the merger. At the company merger
effective time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub I will vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub I will become the
debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Company.
Following the completion of the merger, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.
Effective Time; Closing Date
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties to the merger agreement, the parties will cause the partnership merger
effective time and the company merger effective time to occur on the closing date, with the company merger effective time
occurring immediately after the partnership merger effective time.
On the closing date the Partnership will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The partnership
merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware or such
other date and time as may be mutually agreed by the applicable parties to the merger agreement and specified in the
certificate of merger.
On the closing date the Company and Merger Sub I will cause articles of merger to be executed and filed with the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The merger will become effective upon the later of the acceptance
for record of the articles of merger by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or such other date
and time as may be agreed between the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the articles of merger.
We use the term “closing date” in this proxy statement to refer to the date on which the closing of the mergers occurs. The
closing of the mergers will take place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the parties’
various obligations to effect the merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
52 TABLE OF CONTENTS
closing of the mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing of the mergers), or such
other date as agreed in writing by the parties to the merger agreement; provided, however, that in no event will the closing
of the mergers be required to occur prior to the earlier of (i) a date specified by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II on no less than three business days’ written notice to the Company and (ii) October 21, 2022.
Organizational Documents
The certificate of limited partnership and the limited partnership agreement of the Partnership, as in effect immediately prior
to the partnership merger effective time, will be the certificate of limited partnership and the limited partnership agreement
of the Surviving Partnership, until thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms or applicable law.
At the company merger effective time, the charter of the Company, as amended by the articles of merger, and the bylaws of
Merger Sub I, as in effect immediately prior to the company merger effective time, will be the charter and the bylaws of the
Surviving Company, until thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms or applicable law.
Officers, General Partner and Limited Partners
Following the partnership merger effective time and prior to the company merger effective time, the Company will be the
sole general partner and a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership. Following the company merger effective time, the
Surviving Company will be the sole general partner of the Surviving Partnership.
Additionally, following the company merger effective time, the Parent Entities will be the sole holders of common stock of
the Surviving Company. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the company merger effective time will be the
officers of the Surviving Company from and after the company merger effective time, until their successors are elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation, or removal.
Treatment of Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, RSU Awards and Warrants
Common Stock
The merger agreement provides that at the company merger effective time, each share of our common stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (other than the excluded shares) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.768 per share for each share of Class A
common stock and $6.699 per share for each share of Class T common stock, in each case without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. Excluded common shares will be automatically cancelled and retired and will cease to exist
with no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. If we declare or make a distribution on our
common stock reasonably necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the payment of
income or excise tax under the Code, in each case as permitted under the merger agreement, the per Company A share
merger consideration and/or the per Company T share merger consideration (as applicable) will be decreased by an amount
equal to the per share amount of such distribution.
Series B Preferred Stock
The merger agreement requires the Company to deliver, no later than 20 business days prior to the anticipated closing date,
a notice of optional redemption and “fundamental change” to the holders of record of Series B preferred stock. At the
company merger effective time, each share of our Series B preferred stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the company merger effective time (other than the excluded preferred shares) will be automatically converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the applicable optional redemption price, as determined in accordance with the
Articles Supplementary governing the Series B preferred stock, less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded preferred
shares will be automatically cancelled and retired and will cease to exist with no consideration being delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.
RSU Awards
The merger agreement requires the Company to deliver, prior to the partnership merger effective time, required notices to
the holders of RSU awards. Effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each RSU award (whether
vested or unvested) granted pursuant to the Company’s 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, outstanding
53 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time will be cancelled, in exchange for the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to the RSU award immediately prior to
the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share merger consideration, less any applicable
withholding taxes.
Warrants
The merger agreement requires the Partnership to deliver a “call notice” to the holders of record of warrants to purchase
outstanding Class A OP units of the Partnership, the Class A OP units issued upon exercise of such warrants, and the
shares of common stock issued upon redemption of such Class A OP units. Effective as of immediately prior to the closing,
each callable security held by such holders will be purchased by the Partnership, and at or prior to the partnership merger
effective time, the Parent Entities will pay (or cause to be paid) to the Partnership the aggregate “call price,” as determined
in accordance with the warrant certificate relating thereto, for the benefit of such holders.
Treatment of Partnership Units
The merger agreement provides that at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A OP unit (other than the
continuing units and the cancelled units), in each case as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time, will
be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.768 per unit, without interest. Cancelled
units will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist with no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor. Continuing units will remain unaffected by the partnership merger and will remain outstanding as units of the
Surviving Partnership held by the Company or relevant wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
No Further Ownership Rights
On the closing date, holders of our common stock, Series B preferred stock or Class A OP units will cease to be, and will
have no rights as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners of the Partnership, as applicable, other than the right to
receive the per Company A share merger consideration, the per Company T share merger consideration, the per Company
Series B preferred share merger consideration, and per Partnership unit merger consideration, respectively. The merger
consideration paid and delivered in exchange for book-entry shares or book-entry units, as applicable, will be deemed to
have been paid, delivered or issued, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
common stock, Series B preferred stock or Class A OP units, respectively, exchanged therefor.
Exchange Fund; Exchange Procedures
On the closing date, the share transfer books of the Company and the unit transfer books of the Partnership will be closed
and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of our common stock, Series B preferred stock or Class A OP
units.
Prior to the partnership merger effective time, the Parent Entities will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with DST Systems,
Inc. as paying agent, for the benefit of the holders of our common stock, Series B preferred stock and Class A OP units, an
amount in cash sufficient to pay the merger consideration less the portion of the merger consideration to be paid in respect
of the RSU awards (which will be paid or delivered directly to the Surviving Company) (the portion so deposited with the
paying agent, the “exchange fund”).
Within five business days after the closing date, the Surviving Company will cause the paying agent to (i) mail a customary
instruction request letter to each holder of record of book-entry shares or book-entry units that, immediately prior to the
company merger effective time, represented outstanding common stock or Series B preferred stock or that, immediately
prior to the partnership merger effective time, represented Class A OP units, that were converted into the right to receive or
be exchanged for the applicable merger consideration and (ii) subject to certain requirements set forth in the merger
agreement, make delivery and disbursement of the applicable merger consideration to such holders. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable under the merger agreement to the holders of the book-entry shares or book-entry units.
Any portion of the exchange fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the book-entry shares or book-entry units
for 12 months after the closing date will be delivered to the Surviving Company; and any holders of our common stock,
Series B preferred stock or Class A OP units prior to the company merger effective time or the partnership merger effective
time, as applicable, who have not complied with the exchange and payment procedures contained in the merger

Special Meeting of Stockholders
As soon as reasonably practicable following the date that this proxy statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing, the
Company is required to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of our common stock for the
purpose of seeking the requisite stockholder approval. The Company is required to (1) through our board of directors,
recommend to holders of our common stock that they vote for the merger proposal and (2) use our reasonable best efforts
to solicit the requisite stockholder approval (including by soliciting proxies from our stockholders), except in each case to
the extent that our board of directors has effected an adverse recommendation change.
Unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company may not submit to the vote of our
stockholders any Company acquisition proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, a “Company acquisition proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal from any
person or “group”  (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) involving the Company, the Partnership or our
subsidiaries in any of the following:
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, business combination or
other similar transaction;
any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger,
consolidation, sale of equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise, of
15% or more of consolidated assets, taken as a whole;
any issue, sale or other disposition of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing 15% or more of the Company’s voting power or 15% or more of
the Partnership’s equity interests or general partner interests;
any tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the Company’s equity securities or 15% or more of the
Partnership’s equity interests or general partner interests, or the filing of a registration statement under the
Securities Act in connection therewith;
any other transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any third party proposes to acquire
control of assets having a fair market value of 15% or more of the assets of the Company and our subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction; or
any agreement, or any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention, to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
special meeting after consultation with the Parent Entities, if:
to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is
provided to our stockholders reasonably in advance of a vote on the merger proposal;
additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the merger proposal
(provided that without the Parent Entities’ written consent, in no event will the special meeting (as so
postponed or adjourned) be held more than 30 days after the originally scheduled date); or

Company Acquisition Proposals and Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation
“No-Shop” Period
From and after date of the merger agreement, we have agreed to cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or
communications with any person with respect to any Company acquisition proposal and not to solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Company acquisition proposal, and, subject to certain exceptions, we are not permitted to enter
into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide non-public information to a third party in connection with, any
Company acquisition proposals. However, we may, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, engage in
discussions or negotiations and provide non-public information to a third party that has made an unsolicited written bona
fide Company acquisition proposal, if the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Company acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a superior proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona fide written Company acquisition proposal
(except that for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of “Company acquisition proposal” to “15%”
will be replaced by “50%”) made by a third party on terms that our board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors:
(A) would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company’s stockholders
(solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the merger and
(B) is reasonably likely to be consummated, after taking into account (x) the financial, legal, regulatory and
any other aspects of such proposal, (y) the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the
merger) and (z) any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by the Parent Entities and any
other information provided by the Parent Entities.
We are required to notify the Parent Entities in writing no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any Company
acquisition proposal or any request for non-public information regarding the Company or any of our subsidiaries by any
third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, a Company acquisition proposal, or any
other inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with us regarding a possible Company
acquisition proposal. Such notice will identify the person making such Company acquisition proposal or inquiry and
indicate the material terms and conditions, to the extent known.
We are also required to notify the Parent Entities in writing within 24 hours if we enter into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Company acquisition proposal or provide non-public information to any person, to notify the Parent
Entities of any change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Company acquisition proposal, and
to otherwise keep the Parent Entities reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any Company acquisition
proposal or inquiry on a reasonably current basis.
The merger agreement provides that we may not, and may not permit any of our subsidiaries to, terminate, waive, amend or
modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of our subsidiaries is a
party, except solely to allow the applicable party to make a non-public Company acquisition proposal to our board of
directors or to allow the disclosure of information to the debt financing sources. Additionally, the merger agreement
provides that other than in connection with the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and our board of directors may not take any actions to exempt any person from the “common share ownership
limit” or “aggregate share ownership limit” or establish or increase an “excepted holder limit”  (as such terms are defined in
our charter) unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms.
Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation
Except in the circumstances and pursuant to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, neither our board of
directors nor any committee thereof may:
61 
• 
• 
•

•

• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Parent Entities (or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing) the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the merger;
approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) any Company acquisition
proposal;
fail to include, in this proxy statement, the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the
merger;
(each such action, an “adverse recommendation change”); or
approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree, resolve or propose to do any of the foregoing), or
cause or permit the Company or any of our subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, expense reimbursement agreement, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company acquisition proposal or
requiring the Company or the Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement).
Prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, our board of directors may, in certain circumstances, effect an
adverse recommendation change and/or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
the implementation of a superior proposal, if:
the Company has provided a prior written notice (a “notice of change of recommendation”) to the Parent
Entities that the Company intends to take such action, identifying the person making the superior proposal
and describing the material terms and conditions;
during the four business day period following the Parent Entities’ receipt of the notice of change of
recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on such fourth business day (a “notice of
change period”), the Company negotiates with, and causes its representatives to negotiate with, the Parent
Entities in good faith (to the extent the Parent Entities desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior
proposal or with respect to such intervening event the need to make the adverse recommendation change is
obviated (as the case may be); and
following the end of the notice of change period, our board of directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to the merger
agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Entities in response to the notice of change of recommendation
or otherwise, that (A) the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change of recommendation continues
to constitute a superior proposal or (B) in the case of an intervening event, the failure of our board of
directors to effect an adverse recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the duties of the Company’s directors under applicable law.
For purposes of the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a material event, development or change in
circumstances with respect to the Company and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that occurred or arose after the date of
the merger agreement, which was unknown to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, our board of directors as of or prior to the
date of the merger agreement, and first becomes known to or by our board of directors prior to receipt of the requisite
stockholder approval. However, none of the following will constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has
been, an intervening event:
the receipt, existence of or terms of an inquiry or a Company acquisition proposal or any matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof; and
changes in the market price or trading volume of our common stock or the fact that the Company meets or
exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other
financial results for any period (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such change or fact will not
be so excluded).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nothing contained in the merger agreement will prohibit the Company or our board of directors, directly or indirectly
through representatives, from taking and disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to our
stockholders that is required by applicable law or if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
duties of the Company’s directors under applicable law. However, neither the Company nor our board of directors may
recommend that our stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is a
Company acquisition proposal or otherwise effect an adverse recommendation change with respect thereto, except as
permitted by the merger agreement.
Employee Benefits
From and after the company merger effective time, for the period ending on the first anniversary thereof (or, if shorter,
during any applicable period of employment), the Parent Entities are required to provide or cause their subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the
Company or our subsidiaries immediately prior to the company merger effective time and who continues employment with
the Surviving Company or any of its subsidiaries following the company merger effective time (each, a “Company
Employee”): (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate in effect
with respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the company merger effective time, (ii) a target annual cash
bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the company merger effective time, (iii) equity-based compensation that is substantially
comparable to the equity-based compensation provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent Entities or their
affiliates immediately prior to the company merger effective time (provided that such equity-based compensation may be
subject to performance-vesting terms with respect to a percentage thereof that is the same as (or lower than) the
percentage of equity-based compensation provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent Entities or their affiliates
in the immediately preceding year that was subject to performance-vesting terms), and (iv) other compensation and
benefits (including severance benefits, paid-time off and health insurance that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent Entities or their
affiliates immediately prior to the company merger effective time).
Service with the Company or any of our subsidiaries (and the predecessor of any of them) shall be treated as service with
the Parent Entities or any of their subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and entitlement to benefits including any paid time
off and severance plans (but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension benefits, post-employment welfare benefits,
special or early retirement programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect from time to time),
under each benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership, following the Closing and in which any of the company employees participate, to
the extent such service was recognized by the Company or any subsidiary (except to the extent necessary to avoid
duplication of benefits). After the merger effective time, company employees will continue to be credited with the unused
paid time off with which they were credited through the merger effective time under the applicable Company paid time off
policies (subject to the same forfeiture conditions and accrual limits as applicable prior to the merger effective time).
The Parent Entities will, or will cause their subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, as
the case may be, to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of the
Parent Entities or any of their affiliates applicable to such Company Employee with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to all Company Employees and their dependents under any benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement maintained by the Parent Entities or their affiliates, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership, following the closing of the mergers and in which any of the Company Employees participate (each, a “parent
plan”) that is a welfare plan that such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the closing date (other
than limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or other restrictions that are already in effect
with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any company employee
benefit plan), (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Company Employees under the comparable
company employee benefit plans immediately prior to the closing of the mergers, and (iii) provide each such Company
Employee and his or her dependents with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the closing date
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year within which the company merger

participate after the closing date.
On and after the closing date, the Parent Entities must cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to
honor all company employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the company merger effective time (subject to any rights to terminate, amend or modify
such company employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms in
the Parent Entities’ sole discretion).

approval.

The Company, on the one hand, or the Parent Entities, on the other hand, may terminate and abandon the merger agreement
by written notice to the other at any time prior to the closing date, whether before or after we have obtained the requisite
stockholder approval, if:
any governmental entity of competent authority has issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the mergers substantially on the terms
contemplated by the merger agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and
non-appealable, provided that the right to so terminate the merger agreement is not available to a party if the
issuance of such order, decree or ruling or taking of such other action was primarily due to the failure of the
Company or the Partnership, in the case of termination by us, or of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II, in the case of termination by the Parent Entities, to perform any of its obligations under the
merger agreement;
the mergers have not been consummated on or before November 7, 2022 (the “outside date”), provided that

termination by the Parent Entities, has breached in any material respect its obligations under the merger
agreement in any manner that has caused or resulted in the failure to consummate the merger on or before the

termination fee event”); or

of the mergers should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company has delivered

the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II fail to consummate the closing of the mergers on

prior to the closing date, whether before or after we have obtained the requisite stockholder approval, if:
the Company or the Partnership have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement such that a closing condition relating to
such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements would be incapable of being satisfied by the

Company termination fee event, such Company acquisition proposal or such intention was made
prior to the special meeting); and within 12 months after such a termination of the merger agreement,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to or consummates any Company acquisition
proposal (for this purpose, with the references to “15%” in the definition of “Company acquisition
proposal” being deemed to be references to “50%”).
The Company has also agreed to reimburse the Parent Entities for their reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, and performance of the merger agreement, the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, up to an amount of $10 million (the “expense
reimbursement payment”), if the Parent Entities or the Company terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the Company
expense reimbursement payment event, provided that if the Company has paid the Company termination fee in full, the
Company will not be required to pay the expense reimbursement payment.
The expense reimbursement payment paid by the Company to the Parent Entities will be credited against any Company
termination fee obligation that becomes due.
Termination Fee Payable by the Parent Entities
The Parent Entities have agreed to pay a termination fee of $150 million (the “Parent termination fee”), if:
the Company terminates the merger agreement pursuant to the second Parent termination fee event or the
third Parent termination fee event; or
the Parent Entities terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the first Parent termination fee event, and the
Company was then entitled to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the second Parent termination fee
event or the third Parent termination fee event.
Limited Guarantee and Remedies
Receipt of the Parent termination fee is the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for losses or damages suffered by the
Company or its affiliates or representatives in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, other than certain litigation expenses in enforcing its right to the Parent termination fee and
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
certain indemnification and reimbursement rights related to cooperation with the Parent Entities’ financing plan and
cooperation with potential corporate restructuring or asset sales.
In connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsors have entered into a limited guarantee in our favor to severally
guarantee the Parent Entities’ payment obligations with respect to the Parent termination fee and certain expense
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Parent Entities and the Surviving Company under the merger
agreement, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the limited guarantee, up to $155 million.
We cannot seek specific performance to require the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to consummate the
merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II may seek specific performance to require the Company and the Partnership to consummate the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Amendment and Waiver
At any time before or after the requisite stockholder approval, the merger agreement may be amended by action taken by
the Company, the Partnership, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II. However, after the requisite stockholder
approval, no amendment may be made that requires the approval of the Company’s stockholders under applicable law
without obtaining such further approval.
At any time prior to the closing date, the Company, the Partnership, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II
may extend the time for the performance of any of the other parties’ obligations, waive any breaches or inaccuracies in the
other parties’ representations and warranties, or waive the other parties’ compliance with any of their agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement.

We understand that Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. (the “Company”), Ruby I Holdings LLC (“Parent 1”), Ruby II Holdings
LLC (“Parent 2”), Ruby III Holdings LLC (“Parent 3”), Ruby IV Holdings LLC (“Parent 4”, and together with Parent 1,
Parent 2, and Parent 3, the “Parent Entities”), Ruby Merger Sub I LLC (“Merger Sub I”), Ruby Merger Sub II LP (“Merger
Sub II”), and CWI 2 OP, LP (the “Partnership”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the
form of the draft dated May 5, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for (i) the merger of
Merger Sub II with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership being the surviving entity (the “Partnership Merger”),
and (ii) immediately following the consummation of the Partnership Merger, the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving entity (the “Company Merger,” and together with the Partnership Merger,
the “Mergers”). Pursuant to the Company Merger, each issued and outstanding share of (a) Class A Common Stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Common Stock”), other than shares held by the Parent Entities,
Merger Sub I, or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the Company, or Merger Sub I (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
will be converted into the right to receive $6.768 per share in cash, without interest (the “Per Company A Share Merger
Consideration”), and (b) Class T Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Class T Common Stock,”
and together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”), other than the Excluded Shares, will be
converted into the right to receive $6.699 per share in cash, without interest (the “Per Company T Share Merger
Consideration”), in each case, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. We have been advised by you that the
Company has paid distribution and servicing fees to broker dealers on behalf of the holders of Class T Common Stock in an
amount equal to approximately $4,198,641 (the “Paid Broker Dealer Fees”), and as a result of the reimbursement of such
Paid Broker Dealer Fees to the Company, the Per Company T Share Merger Consideration is less than the Per Company A
Share Merger Consideration by $0.069 per share. The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether, taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both the Per Company A
Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Class A Common Stock and the Per Company T
Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Class T Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) are fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the
Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior

Surviving Company; and any holders of Company Shares, Company Series B Preferred Shares or Class A Partnership
Units prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Per Company A Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company T Share Merger
Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration, as applicable, in each case without any interest thereon, upon compliance with the procedures set forth

Surviving Partnership, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or affiliate
thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or
their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.
(e) Investment of Exchange Fund. After the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Company. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.5(c), to the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Share Merger Consideration, the
Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the cash portion of the Partnership Unit Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within
which to file) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it and all such filed Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. Except as set forth on Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all material
Taxes due and payable by or on behalf of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (whether or not shown on a Tax
Return) have been fully and timely paid, and adequate reserves or accruals for Taxes have been provided in
accordance with GAAP with respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which Taxes are
not yet due and owing, assuming, solely for purposes of this Section 3.13(a), that the Company continues to qualify
as a REIT following the Company Merger Effective Time until the end of the taxable year that includes the Company
Merger Effective Time.
(b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Company’s taxable year ended December 31, 2017,
through December 31, 2021, has been organized and operated in conformity for qualification and taxation as a real
estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (a “REIT”) and (ii) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in the Company’s failure to qualify as a REIT, and no
challenge to the Company’s status or qualification as a REIT is pending or, to the Company’s knowledge, threatened
in writing by any Governmental Entity. The Company has distributed (or, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, was
deemed to have distributed) all of its net taxable income for its taxable year ended December 31, 2021 and each prior
taxable year. The Company has not been required to avail itself of any REIT “savings provisions” under the Code
(including, but not limited to, those set forth in Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7) or 856(g)(5) of the Code), and has not
been required to pay any “deficiency dividends”  (within the meaning of Section 860 of the Code), in either case, to

A-15 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company to avoid the loss of its REIT qualification or avoid U.S. federal income or excise Taxes. The Company does
not have any earnings and profits attributable to itself or any other corporation accumulated in any non-REIT year
within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code. The Company has not (x) engaged, directly or indirectly, in any action
that could result in any “prohibited transaction” Tax pursuant to Section 857(b)(6) of the Code or, to the Company’s

any liability for any material Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 857(f), 860(c)
or 4981 of the Code or (z) sold any asset subject to Tax under Section 337(d) of the Code (and the applicable Treasury

organization, and its classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the date hereof (and, if a Company
Subsidiary has filed an Entity Classification Election on IRS Form 8832, the effective date of such election). Each entity
that is listed in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter as a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability
company has, since the later of the date of its formation and the date on which the Company acquired an interest in
such an entity, been treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case
may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Each entity that is listed in Section 3.13(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter as a corporation has, since the later of the date of its formation or the date on which
the Company acquired an interest in such an entity, been treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a REIT, a
“qualified REIT subsidiary” pursuant to Section 856(i) of the Code (a “QRS”) or a “taxable REIT subsidiary” pursuant
to Section 856(l) of the Code (a “TRS”), as set forth on such schedule. The Company does not own any equity interest
in an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes other than an interest in a TRS or interests in
money market mutual funds that are treated as “cash and cash items (including receivables)” under IRS Revenue
Ruling 2012-17 (2012-25 I.R.B. 1018).
(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to
rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise result in any “built-in gains” Tax under Section 337(d) of the
Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder), or any similar state tax regime.
(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the Company and the Company

other claim or deficiency is pending); (vii) is not subject to any written claim by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction
where the Company or such Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Company

outstanding requests for any Tax ruling from any Governmental Entity and has not received a Tax ruling; and (ix) is not
the subject of a “closing agreement” within the meaning of Section 7121 of the Code (or any comparable agreement

pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, (ii) has any knowledge that the IRS has proposed, in writing, such an
adjustment or a change in accounting method with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) has any
application pending with the IRS or any other Governmental Entity requesting permission for any change in
accounting method,

including in connection with the consideration, negotiation and approval of this Agreement, to the extent that they are

including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred by such

any violation of the Confidentiality Agreement), except in the event such liabilities, obligations or losses arose out of
or result from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective affiliates and Representatives. The Parent Entities shall promptly reimburse the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and Representatives for all reasonable, documented and invoiced costs incurred by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with any cooperation provided under this Section 5.16 or

shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from the Company’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid
by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)
(2) and (3) of the Code in such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income
or a subsequent letter from the Company’s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company’s counsel indicating that the Company received
a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the applicable Parent Termination Fee would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code (or alternatively, the Company’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt
by the Company of the applicable Parent Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the applicable Parent Termination Fee to the Company. The Parent Entities agree to
amend this Section 7.4 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the applicable
Parent Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Company’s chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this Section 7.4(b) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from
its outside counsel as described in this Section 7.4(b). The Parent Entities shall be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations pursuant to this Section 7.4 so long as it deposits into escrow the applicable Parent Termination Fee ,
notwithstanding any delay or reduction in payment to the Company, and shall have no further liability with respect to
payment of the applicable Parent Termination Fee . The portion of applicable Parent Termination Fee that remains
unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to
the foregoing limitations of this Section 7.4. The Company shall fully indemnify the Parent Entities and hold the Parent
Entities harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments
and penalties suffered or incurred by it resulting directly or indirectly from the escrow agreement, including in
connection with the Parent Entities’ compliance with clauses (x), (y) and (z) of this Section 7.4(b).

Courts”), for the purpose of any claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether based in contract, tort or otherwise),

(e) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO

VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

Section 8.5. Interpretation; Certain Definitions. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, exhibit or schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an exhibit or
schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the
words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
“without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
“extent” in the phrase, “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply “if.” All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. Any references to any Contract are to such Contract as
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time. References to a Person are also to its successors
and permitted assigns. All references to “dollars” or “$” refer to currency of the United States of America. All references to
wholly owned Company Subsidiaries shall mean the Partnership and any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly wholly
owned by the Partnership. All references to the “ordinary course of business” shall mean the “ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice”.
Section 8.6. Parties In Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto
and its successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in Section 5.8 and Section 8.12, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 5.8
shall not arise
A-54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
unless and until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.10 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of
any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.
Section 8.7. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
Section 8.8. Specific Performance.
(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of the Company or the Partnership hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) were not performed by the Company or the Partnership in accordance
with their specified terms or in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Company or the
Partnership. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article VII, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on behalf of themselves and the third
party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in Section 8.6, shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Company or
the Partnership and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which
the Parent Entities are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies provided for
pursuant to this Section 8.8(a) by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II shall not in any respect constitute
a waiver by any such party of its respective right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this
Agreement, including under Section 7.3, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in Section 8.8(a) are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall require the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
such party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.8 prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking remedies
pursuant to this Section 8.8(a) or anything set forth in this Section 8.8 restrict or limit such party’s right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available then or thereafter. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that the Parent Entities, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. The Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with the request for or grant of any order or injunction to prevent a
breach of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms hereof. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees
not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
(b) It is agreed that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company’s and the Partnership’s sole and
exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall
be to seek recovery of the Parent Termination Fee, in circumstances in which it is payable in accordance with Section
7.3(d), and the additional costs and expenses provided in Section 7.3(e); provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by the Parent Entities,
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II of Section 5.2(b). Except as provided in this Section 8.8(b), none of the Parent Entities,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability,
whether pursuant to a claim at Law or in equity, to the Company, the Partnership or any of their affiliates or
Representatives, in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and none of the Company, the Partnership or any of their affiliates or Representatives shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any
A-55 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
action or claim against the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or
Representatives for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination.
Section 8.9. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, the Partnership, the Parent
Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II at any time before or after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite
Vote but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties hereto.
Section 8.10. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any breaches or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to Section 8.9, waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, the Partnership, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
Section 8.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall be considered one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.
Section 8.12. Debt Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and affiliates, hereby: (a) agrees that any action, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection herewith or with the Debt Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate
court thereof and each such party irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court, and such action shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without
giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction), (b)
agrees not to bring or support any action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any
forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (c) agrees that service of
process upon any party hereto or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if
notice is given in accordance with Section 8.3, (d) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action in any such court, (e) knowingly, intentionally and
voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law trial by jury in any action brought against any Debt
Financing Source in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (f) agrees that none of the Debt Financing
Sources will have any liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, and, in furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees
not to, and to cause its respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, advisors, auditors, representatives and other
agents not to, (x) seek to enforce this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, or the definitive documents with respect to
the Debt Financing against, make any claims for breach of any of the foregoing against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, any Debt Financing Source in connection with any of the foregoing or (y) seek to enforce any Debt
Financing commitments against, make any claims for breach of the Debt Financing commitments of any Debt Financing
Source against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, any Debt Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, or the definitive documents with respect to the Debt Financing and the
obligations of the Debt Financing Sources thereunder (provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
affect the rights of the Parent Entities and its Subsidiaries against the Debt Financing Sources with respect to the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated thereby), (g) without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (f),
agrees that no Debt
A-56

Financing Source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious
nature and (h) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources are express third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions (collectively, “Debt Financing Sources Protective Provisions”) in Section 7.2 (to the extent such section applies
to the Debt Financing Sources), Section 7.3(e) (to the extent such section applies to the Debt Financing Sources) and this
Section 8.12 and such provisions and the definition of “Debt Financing Sources” shall not be amended in any way material
and adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

Board of Directors 
Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. 
50 North Riverside Plaza, Suite 4200 
Chicago, Illinois 60606
Members of the Board:
We understand that Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. (the “Company”), Ruby I Holdings LLC (“Parent 1”), Ruby II Holdings
LLC (“Parent 2”), Ruby III Holdings LLC (“Parent 3”), Ruby IV Holdings LLC (“Parent 4”, and together with Parent 1,
Parent 2, and Parent 3, the “Parent Entities”), Ruby Merger Sub I LLC (“Merger Sub I”), Ruby Merger Sub II LP (“Merger
Sub II”), and CWI 2 OP, LP (the “Partnership”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the
form of the draft dated May 5, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for (i) the merger of
Merger Sub II with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership being the surviving entity (the “Partnership Merger”),
and (ii) immediately following the consummation of the Partnership Merger, the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving entity (the “Company Merger,” and together with the Partnership Merger,
the “Mergers”). Pursuant to the Company Merger, each issued and outstanding share of (a) Class A Common Stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Common Stock”), other than shares held by the Parent Entities,
Merger Sub I, or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the Company, or Merger Sub I (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
will be converted into the right to receive $6.768 per share in cash, without interest (the “Per Company A Share Merger
Consideration”), and (b) Class T Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Class T Common Stock,”
and together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”), other than the Excluded Shares, will be
converted into the right to receive $6.699 per share in cash, without interest (the “Per Company T Share Merger
Consideration”), in each case, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. We have been advised by you that the
Company has paid distribution and servicing fees to broker dealers on behalf of the holders of Class T Common Stock in an
amount equal to approximately $4,198,641 (the “Paid Broker Dealer Fees”), and as a result of the reimbursement of such
Paid Broker Dealer Fees to the Company, the Per Company T Share Merger Consideration is less than the Per Company A
Share Merger Consideration by $0.069 per share. The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether, taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both the Per Company A
Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Class A Common Stock and the Per Company T
Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Class T Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) are fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the
Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior
executives of the Company;
Reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Mergers,
prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company, including
information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Mergers, with
senior executives of the Company;
