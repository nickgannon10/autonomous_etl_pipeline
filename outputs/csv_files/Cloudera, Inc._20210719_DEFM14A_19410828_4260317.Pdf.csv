Cloudera Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Cloudera common stock (other than shares of Cloudera common stock (i) held by
Cloudera as treasury stock, (ii) owned by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (iv) held by Cloudera stockholders who have not voted in favor of the merger and who shall
have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to any such shares held by any such holder, collectively, the “Excluded Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $16.00 in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), less any
applicable withholding taxes.
2Table of Contents
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration with a designated payment agent for payment to the holders of each outstanding share of Cloudera common stock owned by each
Cloudera Stockholder (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded Shares). For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as
a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights may have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their
shares determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
Company Options. Each option granted under Cloudera’s equity incentive plans (each, a “Company Option”) that is outstanding, vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable
withholding taxes, equal to (i) the excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Option, times (ii)
the number of shares of Cloudera common stock covered by such Company Option. This consideration is referred to herein as the “Option
Consideration.” Each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.
Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards. Each award of Cloudera restricted stock units that vests solely based on continued service
(each, a “Company RSU Award”) and each award of Cloudera restricted stock units with performance-based vesting conditions (each, a “Company
PSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration, times
(ii) the number of shares of Cloudera common stock covered by such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of Company PSU
Awards, based on 100% of the shares underlying the award), payable on the same time-based vesting schedule as the related Company RSU Award
and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance requirement). The foregoing consideration is referred to herein as the “RSU
Consideration” and the “PSU Consideration,” respectively. Each Company RSU Award that vests by its terms at the Effective Time shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes, with respect to each share
covered by such Company RSU Award, payable promptly following the Effective Time (the “Vested RSU Consideration”).
Company ESPP. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement Cloudera took the following actions under its 2017
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”): (i) ensured no new participants will commence participation in the ESPP after June 1, 2021; (ii) ensured
no participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll contribution rate in effect as of June 1, 2021 or make separate non-payroll contributions
on or following such date; and (iii) ensured no new offering period or purchase period will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each
case, after June 1, 2021. If the Effective Time is expected to occur prior to the end of the current purchase period, Cloudera must provide for an earlier
exercise date (including for purposes of determining the purchase price for the current purchase period). Such earlier exercise date will be as close to
the Effective Time as is administratively practicable. The ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time.

The receipt of cash by Cloudera Stockholders in exchange for shares of Cloudera common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction to
Cloudera Stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by each Cloudera Stockholder that is a U.S. Holder (as defined
under the section, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) will result in gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference between the amount of cash received in the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Cloudera common stock
surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.
A Cloudera Stockholder that is a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section, “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Cloudera common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States or Cloudera is a United States real property holding
corporation.
Cloudera Stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”
Cloudera Stockholders should consult their tax advisors in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences relating to the Merger
arising under U.S. federal, state, and local tax laws and non-U.S. tax laws.",11,11

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Cloudera Stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cloudera common
stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their
shares and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in
connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Cloudera Stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of Cloudera
common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Cloudera common
stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount
paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal
proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Cloudera Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Cloudera Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement
if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Cloudera common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Cloudera Stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Cloudera before the vote is taken on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii)
continue to hold shares of Cloudera common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for
exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal
rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Cloudera unless certain stock ownership
conditions are satisfied by the Cloudera Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in

rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Cloudera common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more

The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. We anticipate that the total
amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing
of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, will be approximately $5.3 billion. This amount includes funds needed to: (1)
pay Cloudera Stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their Cloudera common stock, (2) make payments in respect of our
outstanding Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards payable at closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (3) make
payments in respect of our outstanding Company Options payable at closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (4) to refinance
certain existing indebtedness of the Company (collectively, the “Required Amounts”).
The CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds have committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent at the closing of the Merger an
aggregate amount in cash equal to $3.0 billion, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in equity commitment letters provided by such fund,
dated as of June 1, 2021 (the “Equity Commitment Letters”). Cloudera is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely
with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the commitment under the Equity Commitment Letters by the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds to
be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, and to cause Parent to enforce its rights against the CD&R Funds and the
KKR Funds to perform its funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the limited guaranties delivered by the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds in favor of Cloudera, dated as of June 1, 2021 (the
“Guaranties”), the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds have agreed to guarantee the payment of certain liabilities and obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to $296.6 million, including any termination fee and amounts in respect
of certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent and Merger Sub for certain costs, expenses or losses incurred or sustained by
Cloudera, as specified in the Merger Agreement.

Letters, the “Financing Letters”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., KKR Capital Markets LLC and KKR
Corporate Lending LLC (the “Committed Lenders”), pursuant to which the Committed Lenders have committed to provide, upon certain terms and
subject to certain conditions, Merger Sub with Debt Financing (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Financing

the market “flex” provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters (or, in the case of the Debt Financing, on other terms and conditions that are
acceptable to Parent, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement).
Cloudera has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to provide,
to Parent and Merger Sub such cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the

The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Cloudera and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera, the performance by Cloudera of its covenants and other
obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that Cloudera Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera Stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of Directors may withdraw
or change the foregoing recommendation if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.
However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger
Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the recommendation change,
negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a three (3) business day period, after which the Board of Directors shall have
determined that the failure of the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company
Board Recommendation Change”) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to stockholders
under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Cloudera to enter
into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The “Go Shop” Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”) will result in the
payment by Cloudera of a termination fee of $171,734,000 and, if such termination had occurred before the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with
respect to an Excluded Party , prior to the Cut-Off Time) and certain other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement had been met, the Company
would have been required to pay a termination fee of $92,472,000. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned

the opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to
read Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as
such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares
of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and
does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or
not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how
Cloudera stockholders should vote at the special meeting.

When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, Cloudera Stockholders should be aware that Cloudera’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, Cloudera Stockholders more generally. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, (2) approving the
Merger Agreement and the Merger and (3) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware
of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that these interests existed at the time. These interests include:
•
at the Effective Time, each Company Option, Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award held by an executive officer or director
will receive the treatment described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Cloudera’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Company Equity Awards;”
•
eligibility of Cloudera’s executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits (including equity award vesting acceleration)
under their employment agreements with Cloudera, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Interests of Cloudera’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Executive Employee Arrangements;” and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of Cloudera common stock held by Cloudera directors and executive
officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of Cloudera

The “Go Shop” Period—Solicitation of Other Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time on July 1, 2021 (such date, the “No Shop
Period Start Date” and such period, the “Go Shop Period”), Cloudera, its affiliates and their respective representatives had the right to, among other
things: (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce, encourage or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, could constitute or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) subject to the
entry into, and solely in accordance with, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The ‘Go Shop’ Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”), provide any non-public information to, any
third person with the intent to facilitate the making of an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal
1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The ‘Go Shop’ Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”); (iii) continue, enter into, maintain, participate or
otherwise engage in discussions with any third person (and its representatives and financing sources) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (or
any proposal or inquiry that could constitute or reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal); and (iv) cooperate with or assist or
participate in or facilitate any such proposals, inquiries, offers, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition
Proposal.
The “No Shop” Period—No Solicitation of Other Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time) until the Effective
Time, Cloudera may not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any non-public information to, any person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The ‘Go Shop’ Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, from the No Shop Period Start Date until the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by Cloudera’s stockholders, Cloudera may, among other things, provide information to, and engage or participate in
negotiations or substantive discussions with, a person in respect of a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition
Proposal or assist such person (and its representatives, prospective debt and equity financing sources and/or their respective representatives) with
such Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person) and such Acquisition Proposal did not result from the breach of Cloudera’s
obligations, as described in the immediately preceding paragraph if (and only if), subject to complying with certain procedures described in the
subsequent paragraph, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably likely lead to a Superior Proposal,
and, in each case, the failure to take such actions in respect of such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The ‘No Shop’ Period—No Solicitation of Other Offers.”
10Table of Contents
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera’s stockholders, Cloudera is entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the
purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal if it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including,
but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a five (5) business day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a “Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Cloudera to enter into a definitive
agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by Cloudera of a termination fee
of $171,734,000. If such termination had occurred before the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, prior to the Cut-Off
Time), and the Company had complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company
would have been required to pay a termination fee of $92,472,000. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change.”",17,18

In addition to the circumstances described above, Parent and Cloudera have certain rights to terminate the Merger Agreement under
customary circumstances, including by mutual agreement, the imposition of laws or non-appealable court orders that make the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibit the Merger, an uncured breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party, if the Merger has not been consummated by 11:59
p.m., Pacific time on March 1, 2022 (the “Termination Date”) (as further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:

Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof). Under certain specified circumstances, (i) Cloudera is required to pay Parent a
termination fee equal to $171,734,000 (if termination had occurred before the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, prior to

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special
Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement,
along with all of the documents we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how
it affects you. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the
caption, “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
A: The Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock in
connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q: When and where is the Special Meeting?
A: Cloudera will hold the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting
physically in person.
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A: You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Cloudera, and Cloudera will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent;
•
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A: Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of Cloudera
common stock shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of
business on the Record Date.
Q: May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website on August
25, 2021 and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If you are a stockholder of record, you will need your assigned
16-digit control number to vote shares electronically at the Special Meeting. The control number can be found on the proxy card, voting instruction form,
or other applicable proxy notices.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, we encourage you
to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.
13Table of Contents
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the
voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals,
including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of $16.00 in cash, without interest, less any
applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Cloudera common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your
appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Cloudera common stock, you will receive $1,600 in cash in exchange for your
shares of Cloudera common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides that each Company Option that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration. Each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.
Each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by
its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively,
payable on the same time-based vesting schedule as the related Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance
requirement). Each Company RSU Award that vests by its terms at the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive Vested RSU
Consideration.
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock is required to adopt the Merger
Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each “broker non-vote” will also have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or
dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If you properly sign
your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy
will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3)
“FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Table of Contents
Q: Have any Cloudera Stockholders already agreed to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A: Yes. Icahn, which collectively owns 52,327,391 shares of Cloudera common stock representing approximately 18% of the outstanding shares of
Cloudera common stock as of June 1, 2021, has entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Icahn has agreed,
among other things, to vote all shares of Cloudera common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and against any competing
transaction so long as the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and the Board of Directors has not made a Company Board Recommendation
Change. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Voting
Agreement.”
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of Cloudera common stock. Instead, Cloudera will remain an independent public company, Cloudera common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, Cloudera will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $171,734,000 (if termination had occurred before the No
Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, prior to the Cut-Off Time) and certain other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement
had been met, the Company would have been required to pay a termination fee of $92,472,000), upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.”
Q: Why are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A: The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Cloudera to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain
payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q: What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.
Q: What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation
Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cloudera. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is
completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Cloudera’s named executive officers in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q: What do I need to do now?
A: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the
Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other
things, the Merger and how it

affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the
Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q: Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and written instructions that explain
how to exchange shares of Cloudera common stock represented by such holder’s book-entry shares for merger consideration.
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Cloudera common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If
you sell or transfer your shares of Cloudera common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Cloudera in
writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person
to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer
your shares of Cloudera common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to
be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Cloudera.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of Cloudera common stock
held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with
respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee.
Q: How may I vote?
A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Cloudera common stock are registered in your name with Computershare, our transfer
agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.

Table of Contents
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Cloudera common stock,
and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur
costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Cloudera common stock by proxy. If
you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Cloudera common
stock in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in
person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you
should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Cloudera; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
If you hold your shares of Cloudera common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee.
Q: What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Cloudera common stock. The written document describing the
matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares
of Cloudera common stock is called a “proxy card.” Robert Bearden, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Jim Frankola,
our Chief Financial Officer, or either of them, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, each with full power of substitution and re-substitution.

Table of Contents
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the
way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?
A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for
each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one (1) name, you will
receive more than one (1) proxy card.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: Cloudera intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All
reports that Cloudera files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of
Cloudera common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you received pursuant to the Merger and you adjusted tax basis in the shares of
common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Cloudera common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States.
You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in light of your own
particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of
certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the caption “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2021.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

This proxy statement, and any document to which Cloudera refers in this proxy statement, contains “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended. These forward-looking statements
are based on Cloudera’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential
benefits thereof, its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub, all of which are
subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition,
and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,”
“potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey
uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of
which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the
anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the Merger or to make or take any filing or
other action required to consummate the Merger on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue
reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a
difference include, but are not limited to:
•
the completion of the Merger on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining stockholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax
treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness,
financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Cloudera’s
business and other conditions to the completion of the Merger;
•
conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be satisfied;
•
the Merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the Merger;
•
the failure by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the necessary debt financing arrangements set forth in the commitment letters received in
connection with the Merger;

•
Cloudera’s ability to implement its business strategy;
•
significant transaction costs associated with the Merger;
•
potential litigation relating to the Merger;
•
the risk that disruptions from the Merger will harm Cloudera’s business, including current plans and operations;
•
the ability of Cloudera to retain and hire key personnel;
•
potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger;
•
legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Cloudera’s business;

Cloudera’s financial performance;

restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact Cloudera’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic
transactions;
•
unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well
as Cloudera’s response to any of the aforementioned factors;
•
changes in tax laws or in Cloudera’s effective tax rate; and

Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on the record date, which is July 1, 2021, will be entitled to notice of and to
vote at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 296,132,583 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote, held of record by approximately 88 stockholders.
Pursuant to our bylaws, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at
the Special Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Each of our stockholders is
entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of common stock held as of the record date on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders for
their vote. For at least ten days prior to the Special Meeting, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available upon
written request by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting. Requests should be sent to Cloudera, Inc. at investor-

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
As of the Record Date, 148,066,293 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement
by stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.
22Table of Contents
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote
on the subject matter is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal. For stockholders who
attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST”
any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting.
Each “broker non-vote” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return
a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of
such shares. Cloudera does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees
only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Cloudera common stock at the Special Meeting
without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “against” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cloudera common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise
lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This
means that holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and
who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, (or in
25Table of Contents
certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference
between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not
seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Cloudera before the vote is taken on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold your shares of
Cloudera common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal
rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions
are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the
DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated
herein by reference. If you hold your shares of Cloudera common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise

before the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, prior to the Cut-Off Time) and certain other conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement had been met, the Company would have been required to pay a termination fee of $92,472,000), upon the termination of the
Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination

Merger Consideration
Cloudera Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each share of Cloudera common stock (other than Excluded Shares, which include, among other things, shares of Cloudera
common stock owned by stockholders who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Cloudera common
stock that you own (less any applicable withholding taxes), but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who
properly exercise their appraisal rights will have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal
proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that each Company Option that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration. Each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.
Each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by
its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively,
payable on the same time-based vesting schedule as the related Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance
requirement). Each Company RSU Award that vests by its terms at the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Vested
RSU Consideration.
In connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Cloudera took the following actions under the ESPP: (i) ensured no new
participants will commence participation in the ESPP after June 1, 2021; (ii) ensured no participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll
contribution rate in effect as of June 1, 2021 or make separate non-payroll contributions on or following such date; and (iii) ensured no new offering
period or purchase period will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after June 1, 2021. If the Effective Time is expected to occur
prior to the end of the current purchase period, Cloudera must provide for an earlier exercise date (including for purposes of determining the purchase
price for the current purchase period). Such earlier exercise date will be as close to the Effective Time as is administratively practicable. The ESPP will
terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time.

Events Leading Up to the Merger Agreement
As part of Cloudera’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and Cloudera’s senior
management periodically review, consider and assess Cloudera’s operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they
may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business
combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.
On January 3, 2019, Cloudera completed its previously announced all-stock business combination transaction with Hortonworks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Hortonworks”). The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on that date was
$10.37 per share.
From time to time in 2019 following the closing of the business combination with Hortonworks, representatives of KKR and members of senior
management of Cloudera met to discuss the market generally and Cloudera’s business and performance after the business combination with
Hortonworks. These interactions were based on longstanding relationships between members of senior management at Hortonworks and representatives
of KKR.
On June 5, 2019, Cloudera announced fiscal first quarter 2020 results following the Cloudera-Hortonworks merger, reduced its full-year guidance for
2020 and announced the resignation of its then current CEO.
Based on Cloudera’s performance post-merger, in early June 2019, following the review and approval of the Board of Directors, Cloudera engaged
Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor in connection with a review of certain potential strategic alternatives, including a potential “PIPE” transaction and
the possible sale of Cloudera. The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley in connection with such strategic review based on its qualifications and
its experience in the software industry, as well as its familiarity with Cloudera.
On June 13, 2019, Morgan Stanley, acting on behalf of Cloudera and at the direction of the Board of Directors, reached out to representatives of
KKR and invited KKR to present to the Board of Directors regarding its views on potential strategic alternatives available to Cloudera, given KKR’s
familiarity with Cloudera’s business.
On June 20, 2019, representatives of KKR gave an informational presentation to the Board of Directors describing the types of potential
transactions involving Cloudera that a financial sponsor might be interested in pursuing. No specific transaction was discussed and no proposal was
made by KKR at that time. Representatives of KKR also conveyed to the Board of Directors at that meeting that it may not be an ideal time for Cloudera
to pursue a potential sale of Cloudera to a financial sponsor, based on the status of its business transition and ongoing integration of Hortonworks.
By August 1, 2019, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange had decreased to $6.35 per share as of the close
of trading on that date.
On August 1, 2019, Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates (collectively referred to as the “Icahn Group”) filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC
disclosing that collectively they beneficially owned approximately 12.62% of the then-outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock. As part of the
Schedule 13D, the Icahn Group expressed its view that shares of Cloudera common stock were undervalued and indicated an intention to speak with
representatives of the Board of Directors and management to discuss enhancing stockholder value and potentially seeking board representation.
31Table of Contents
On August 12, 2019, Cloudera entered into a voting and standstill agreement with the Icahn Group, pursuant to which, among other matters,
Cloudera agreed to appoint two new directors, Nicholas Graziano and Jesse Lynn, designated by the Icahn Group to the Board of Directors. Cloudera also
agreed to add one of the new directors to each of the CEO Search Committee of the Board of Directors and the M&A Committee of the Board of Directors.
The M&A Committee of the Board of Directors was a standing committee established by the Board of Directors for convenience to consider a broad array
of potential strategic transactions and provide regular feedback and guidance to Cloudera’s senior management regarding such potential transactions. At
the time of that agreement, the Icahn Group reported on Schedule 13D that it beneficially owned approximately 18% of Cloudera’s then-outstanding
shares of common stock.
On November 15, 2019, the M&A Committee which at the time was comprised of Peter Fenton, Paul Cormier and Nicholas Graziano, held a meeting
via videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera’s senior management, Cloudera’s outside legal counsel at Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”)
and Morgan Stanley present, to discuss potential outreach to potentially interested bidders in connection with a possible sale of Cloudera. Following
discussion of potential interested parties as well as the likelihood of potential interest based on Cloudera’s performance during the prior six months, the
M&A Committee instructed representatives of Cloudera’s senior management, with assistance from Morgan Stanley, to begin limited outreach to certain
counterparties to gauge potential interest in the possible sale of Cloudera. The M&A Committee chose to conduct a targeted approach in its outreach
due to concerns related to confidentiality. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on
November 15, 2019 was $8.76 per share.
During the course of December 2019 until early February 2020, representatives of Morgan Stanley, as instructed by the M&A Committee, contacted
four potential counterparties (comprised of one strategic counterparty and three private equity sponsors, including KKR) to solicit interest in a potential
acquisition of Cloudera. Due to the complexity of Cloudera’s technology transition and concerns around confidentiality, contacted parties were selected
based on their familiarity with Cloudera in order to understand the potential interest of the most advanced parties before determining how narrow or
broad to conduct their outreach. Each party executed a confidentiality agreement with Cloudera and attended a management presentation by Cloudera’s
senior management. Each such confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision with a term of 12 months or less that expired upon the
announcement of a change of control transaction. During this outreach process, members of senior management of Cloudera and representatives from
Morgan Stanley sent periodic updates to the M&A Committee regarding the status of discussions. However, due to general concerns regarding the
status of Cloudera’s business transition and integration of Hortonworks, none of the contacted parties expressed an interest in submitting a proposal for
an acquisition of the Company at the time.
On January 12, 2020, the Board of Directors appointed Robert Bearden, a member of the Board of Directors, as the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Cloudera. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on January 13, 2020 was
$11.74 per share.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and Cloudera’s stock price fell roughly in line with the
impact of COVID-19 on other market participants in the same industry. By March 18, 2020, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange had decreased to $5.30 per share as of the close of trading on that date.
In late March 2020 and into April 2020, representatives of a large US-based software-focused private equity firm (“PE Firm A”), which had not
previously been contacted during the previous outreach process in December to February 2020, approached Mr. Bearden on an unsolicited basis to
express an interest in potentially acquiring Cloudera in a take-private transaction. During the course of these discussions with PE Firm A, members of
senior management of Cloudera and representatives from Morgan Stanley continued to provide periodic updates to the M&A Committee and the Board
of Directors regarding the status of discussions with PE Firm A.

Table of Contents
Following several substantive discussions and diligence meetings in late April and early May 2020, on May 12, 2020, PE Firm A submitted a non-
binding proposal to acquire Cloudera for $8.50 per share of Cloudera common stock. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 12, 2020 was $8.33 per share.
On May 13, 2020, the Board of Directors held a special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera’s senior management,
Latham and Morgan Stanley present, to discuss the proposal from PE Firm A. Following discussion and the presentation by Morgan Stanley of certain
preliminary financial analyses, the Board of Directors determined that the proposal from PE Firm A was timed to take advantage of the short-term impacts
of COVID-19, and did not represent sufficient value to Cloudera’s stockholders and directed senior management, with the assistance of Morgan Stanley,
to conduct outreach to potential acquirers to evaluate interest in a potential acquisition of Cloudera (including previously contacted parties). The Board
of Directors also instructed Cloudera’s senior management to prepare updated forecasts for use with potential bidders in connection with their evaluation
of a potential acquisition of Cloudera.
On May 29, 2020, the Board of Directors held another special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera’s senior
management, Latham and Morgan Stanley present, and approved the May 2020 Forecasts for use in connection with outreach to potential acquirers. The
May 2020 Forecasts were provided to each of the contacted parties in May and June 2020, including CD&R and KKR.
During the course of late May and early June 2020, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted each of the parties previously contacted
regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera and engaged with six additional private equity firms (including CD&R) and three additional
strategic parties in order to solicit potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera. Each party who had previously not executed a confidentiality
agreement entered into a confidentiality agreement with Cloudera, which included a customary standstill provision with a term of 12 months or less that
expired upon the announcement of a change of control transaction. Three of the newly contacted private equity firms (including CD&R) and two of the
newly contacted strategic parties each separately attended a management presentation with members of Cloudera’s senior management team. In addition,
Cloudera’s senior management team also had follow-up meetings with each of the parties previously contacted beginning in December 2019 regarding
their potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera (including KKR). However, none of the contacted parties decided to submit a proposal, again citing
concerns around the execution of Cloudera’s business transition, the status of the Hortonworks integration process and valuation concerns as reflected
in the then current stock price. However, representatives of CD&R expressed a desire to revisit discussions after another one or two fiscal quarters of
additional performance. In addition, by early June 2020, equity values in the United States had generally recovered from their COVID-19 pandemic lows,
and on June 1, 2020, the price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $10.96 per share. As a result, PE Firm A and
Cloudera did not continue discussions regarding a potential transaction. In consultation with the M&A Committee and the Board of Directors, members
of Cloudera’s senior management decided to pause ongoing discussions regarding the possible sale of Cloudera, but agreed to stay in contact with
parties regarding their potential interest.
During the course of the following six months, Cloudera’s business continued to perform better than analyst expectations, but its stock price
remained largely flat (trading between approximately $10 and $13 per share on the New York Stock Exchange). Representatives of Cloudera’s senior
management stayed in periodic contact with the parties previously engaged in discussions regarding the possible sale of Cloudera in order to monitor
possible interest per prior discussions with the M&A Committee.
In November and December 2020, representatives of CD&R and Cloudera’s senior management held meetings to provide CD&R with an update on
Cloudera’s go-to-market and financial performance.
In December 2020, Cloudera’s senior management prepared the December 2020 Board Plan. The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the
December 2020 Board Plan on December 15, 2020, The December 2020 Board Plan was shared with representatives of CD&R on January 12, 2021 in
connection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.

On January 27, 2021 representatives of CD&R contacted Mr. Bearden and proposed a $550 million investment in convertible preferred stock of
Cloudera with a dividend yield of 6.0% per year and a conversion price of $14.39, which represented a 20% premium to the 90-day volume weighted
average price of Cloudera common stock.
On February 2, 2021, Mr. Bearden, based on feedback from discussions with members of the Board of Directors and consideration of the dilutive
effect and costs associated with the transaction, informed CD&R that Cloudera was not interested in pursuing the minority investment. However, the
Board of Directors indicated support for continuing discussions regarding a potential sale of the Company with CD&R
In the first calendar quarter of 2021, representatives of CD&R and Cloudera’s senior management held several additional meetings to provide
CD&R with an update on Cloudera’s business, technology and financial performance.
On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera’s senior management, Latham
and Morgan Stanley present, and approved the March 2021 Board Plan, which updated the December 2020 Board Plan for actual results for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2021.
On April 1, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted Mr. Bearden to propose a potential diligence work plan in order to confirm CD&R’s interest in
a potential acquisition of Cloudera. During the course of April, representatives of Cloudera and CD&R participated in several additional diligence
meetings to review high priority information requested by CD&R.
The March 2021 Board Plan was shared with representatives of CD&R on April 12, 2021 in connection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.
At the same time, members of Cloudera’s senior management also provided to CD&R the Upside Scenario (which was intended to encourage CD&R to
submit an attractive proposal).
On May 11, 2021, the M&A Committee held a meeting via videoconference with certain other directors, representatives of Cloudera senior
management, Latham and Morgan Stanley present. Mr. Bearden provided an update to the M&A Committee on the status of discussions with CD&R and
the various meetings held with CD&R. Following discussion, the M&A Committee instructed Mr. Bearden to continue discussions with CD&R, given the
seriousness of their potential interest and prior discussions. The M&A Committee also considered additional outreach to potential bidders by Morgan
Stanley and Cloudera’s senior management. However, given concerns about the negative impact of potential deal leaks and the belief that interest from
other bidders was unlikely based on past outreach, the M&A Committee ultimately determined not to reach out to other bidders at that stage and instead
to require a customary “go-shop” provision if the parties ultimately reached a deal, which would allow Cloudera to solicit additional bids for a specified
period of time following the signing of any definitive agreement with respect to a transaction, particularly given the familiarity that likely bidders already
had with Cloudera after the outreach to other potential bidders in 2019 and again in 2020.
On May 13, 2021, representatives of Cloudera senior management conducted two additional diligence meetings with representatives of CD&R on
Cloudera’s bookings and cost structure.
On May 13, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an initial verbal non-binding indication of
interest to acquire Cloudera for cash based on a per share price of $14.50 per share of Cloudera common stock, with customary go-shop parameters to be
negotiated. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 13, 2021 was $11.43 per
share. Morgan Stanley communicated to CD&R that they would convey the proposal to Cloudera, but that it would likely be considered too low by the
Board of Directors.
Later in the day on May 13, 2021, representatives of CD&R contacted Morgan Stanley and increased their verbal proposal to $15.00 per share.
CD&R’s revised offer of $15.00 per share represented a 30% premium to the closing price of Cloudera’s common stock on May 12.

On May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a special meeting by videoconference, with representatives from Cloudera’s senior management,
Latham and Morgan Stanley present, to discuss the proposal from CD&R. Latham reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board of Directors certain preliminary financial analyses based on the proposal from CD&R.
Following discussion, the Board of Directors determined that the proposal from CD&R did not represent adequate value and instructed Morgan Stanley
to respond with a counter-proposal of $17.00 in cash per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 45 days, (2) a termination fee
payable by Cloudera of 1.25% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of
2.50% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other
circumstances and (4) no financing contingencies related to the transaction. At the meeting, the Board of Directors also requested that Morgan Stanley
seek clarity from CD&R regarding the status of its equity commitments since the Board of Directors expected that it would likely be necessary for CD&R
to bring in another financial sponsor to participate in the process.
Following the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of CD&R to relay the counter-proposal as outlined by the
Board of Directors. Representatives of CD&R indicated that a price of $17.00 per share in cash would not be acceptable and that the go-shop terms would
need to be revised. The CD&R representatives further indicated that they would revert with another proposal, including with additional clarity on
expected equity financing sources.
Later that same evening, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to CD&R (“Kirkland”), contacted representatives of Latham in order
to discuss preliminary transaction matters.
On May 15, 2021, representatives of KKR contacted Mr. Bearden to express an interest in joining a transaction with CD&R to acquire Cloudera and
provide the remaining needed equity commitments for a potential transaction. That same day, Cloudera and KKR entered into a new confidentiality
agreement relating to the potential transaction.
On May 17, 2021, Cloudera provided consent to CD&R under its existing confidentiality agreement with Cloudera in order to work with KKR on a
joint proposal for a potential acquisition of Cloudera.
On May 18, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an updated verbal proposal to
acquire Cloudera for cash based on a price of $15.15 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 30 days, (2) a termination fee
payable by Cloudera of 2.0% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of
3.5% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other
circumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse
termination fee payable by CD&R and KKR of 5.25% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR
terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of debt financing. Representatives of CD&R also
indicated that they would expect a customary transaction support agreement from the Icahn Group executed at the time of signing the merger agreement.
Such support agreement would require the Icahn Group to vote its shares of Cloudera common stock in favor of the merger, subject to certain exceptions.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley indicated to CD&R that the proposal price would not be sufficient but that they would revert with a complete
response after discussion with the M&A Committee.
On May 19, 2021, the M&A Committee held a meeting via videoconference with certain other directors and representatives of Cloudera senior
management, Latham and Morgan Stanley present. Mr. Bearden provided an
35
Table of Contents
update to the M&A Committee on the status of discussions with CD&R and KKR, and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the details of the
latest proposal from CD&R and KKR, including certain related preliminary financial analysis. Following discussion, the M&A Committee determined that
the proposal from CD&R did not represent an adequate proposal and instructed Morgan Stanley to respond with a counter-proposal of $16.25 in cash per
share of Cloudera common stock, with the goal of achieving a price of at least $16.00 per share. The M&A Committee also instructed Morgan Stanley to
respond with a request for (1) a go-shop period of 40 days, (2) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 1.5% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the
aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to
the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.0% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration
if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain other circumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in
recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee payable by CD&R and KKR of 6.0% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the
aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of
debt financing. The price per share of Cloudera common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the close of trading on May 19, 2021 was $12.07 per
share.
Following the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of CD&R to relay the counter-proposal as outlined by the
M&A Committee.
On May 21, 2021, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of Latham an initial draft of the merger agreement for the transaction, which
reflected the previously outlined terms of the go-shop and termination fees proposed by CD&R and KKR.
On May 24, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to indicate that they would provide an updated
proposal to Cloudera later that week. Members of Cloudera’s senior management provided the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts to CD&R and KKR on
that same day.
Later that same day, representatives of Kirkland sent to representatives of Latham an initial draft of the support agreement to be executed by the
Icahn Group in connection with the transaction.
On May 25, 2021, the Board of Directors, with representatives of Cloudera senior management, Latham and Morgan Stanley present, held a meeting
to discuss the latest status of discussions with CD&R and KKR. At the same meeting, the Board of Directors also reviewed the May 2021 Final Updated
Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 with Cloudera’s senior management. In connection with such review, the Board
of Directors directed Morgan Stanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031, or a
subset thereof, in performing its financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion. The Board of Directors also discussed certain
“stretch case” forecasts in the Upside Scenario, which had previously been provided to CD&R as part of evaluating a potential acquisition of Cloudera.
The Board of Directors concluded that the Upside Scenario was unlikely to be achieved and that Cloudera’s prospects as a stand-alone company should
be evaluated on the basis of the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts. The May 2020 Forecasts, the December 2020 Board Plan, the March 2021 Board Plan,
the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the Upside Scenario are each described in the section entitled “-Management Projections” beginning on page
51 of this proxy statement.
On May 26, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey an updated proposal to acquire
Cloudera for cash based on a price of $15.60 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 35 days, (2) a termination fee payable by
Cloudera of 1.75% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.75% of
Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances or if
CD&R

Table of Contents
terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee payable by CD&R
and KKR of 5.5% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under
certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of debt financing. Representatives of Morgan Stanley responded, based on their discussions
with the Board of Directors, that they would not expect the Board of Directors to accept anything less than $16.00 per share but that the Board of
Directors might be willing to consider terms less favorable to Cloudera on the go-shop in exchange for a higher price.
Later that same evening, representatives of Latham sent to representatives of Kirkland comments on behalf of Cloudera on the draft merger
agreement and an initial draft of Cloudera’s disclosure schedules, as well as comments from the Icahn Group on the draft support agreement.
On May 27, 2021, representatives of CD&R and KKR contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to convey their “best and final” package
proposal to acquire Cloudera for cash based on a price of $16.00 per share of Cloudera common stock, with (1) a go-shop period of 30 days (subject to
extension for another 10 days for parties which submit an acquisition proposal during the initial 30-day go-shop period that the Board determines is
reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal), (2) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 1.75% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate
merger consideration if Cloudera terminated the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal prior to the end of
the go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by Cloudera of 3.75% of Cloudera’s equity value based on the aggregate merger consideration if
Cloudera terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances or if CD&R terminated the merger agreement as a result of a change in
recommendation by the Board of Directors and (4) a reverse termination fee of 5.5% payable by CD&R and KKR of Cloudera’s equity value based on the
aggregate merger consideration if CD&R and KKR terminated the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including due to lack of availability of
debt financing.
Between May 28, 2021 and May 31, 2021, representatives of Latham and Kirkland negotiated and finalized the terms of the merger agreement,
including, the go-shop procedures, the financing cooperation covenant, and the materiality bring-down threshold with respect to the capitalization
representation at closing, and the equity commitment letters, limited guaranties, debt commitment letter and disclosure schedules. In addition,
representatives of Kirkland and the Icahn Group negotiated and finalized the terms of the support agreement to be executed by the Icahn Group,
including the right of the Icahn Group to act as a representative of Cloudera in connection with the go-shop. All open points in the transaction
documents were substantially resolved by the afternoon of May 31, 2021.
On May 31, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley sent a memorandum to Latham, who in turn shared the memorandum with the Board of
Directors, disclosing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and certain of its affiliates, on the one hand, and CD&R and KKR, on the other hand.
On May 31, 2021, the Board of Directors held a meeting via videoconference, with representatives of Cloudera senior management, Latham and
Morgan Stanley present. Latham reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties and also provided an overview of the disclosure memorandum
provided by Morgan Stanley. The Board of Directors determined that the relationships did not reflect a material conflict in the context of the proposed
transaction. Representatives of Morgan Stanley then reviewed their financial analyses of the merger consideration, and representatives of Latham
reviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement, support agreement, equity commitment letters, limited guaranties and debt commitment letter.
Thereafter, the representatives of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board of Directors Morgan Stanley’s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of May 31, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received
by the holders of shares of Cloudera Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders of shares of Cloudera Common Stock. After further deliberation and discussion, the Board of Directors
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Cloudera and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger
37

merger agreement by Cloudera, the performance by Cloudera of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Cloudera adopt the merger agreement
in accordance with the DGCL and (iv) approved the support agreement.
On June 1, 2021, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, support agreement, equity commitment letters, limited guaranties and
debt commitment letter.
Early in the morning on June 1, 2021 prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the parties issued a press release announcing
the transaction.
The “Go-Shop” Period
Beginning on June 1, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley reached out to 17 parties to invite such parties to participate in Cloudera’s go-shop
process. Such parties were identified as having the most likely strategic interest in acquiring Cloudera and the financial capability to complete an
acquisition. Ten of the contacted parties were strategic parties, and the remaining seven parties were potential private equity bidders.
All of the invited parties indicated they were not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Cloudera, without any request to do due diligence.
At 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on July 1, 2021, the “go–shop” period ended with Cloudera not having received any alternative acquisition
proposals.",38,45

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Cloudera and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,
to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera, the performance by Cloudera of its covenants and other obligations under
the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii)
resolved to recommend that Cloudera Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with Cloudera management, Latham and Morgan
Stanley. The Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including those below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of
which it viewed as generally supporting its (i) approval of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera, the performance by Cloudera
of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) resolution to recommend that Cloudera Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement:
•
the current and historical market prices of Cloudera common stock, including the market performance of the Cloudera common stock relative
to those of other participants in Cloudera’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Per Share Merger Consideration
constituted a premium of 24.4%
38Table of Contents
over Cloudera’s closing stock price of $12.86 on May 28, 2021 (the trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger), and a
premium of 30% over Cloudera’s 30-day volume-weighted average share price through that date;
•
the belief of the Board of Directors, after a thorough review of Cloudera’s business, market trends, results of operations, competitive
landscape, execution risks and financial condition, and discussions with Cloudera’s management and advisors, that the value offered to
Cloudera Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement is more favorable to Cloudera Stockholders than the potential long-term and
sustainable value that might have resulted from remaining an independent public company, considering (among other things):
•
risks and uncertainties regarding efforts to drive customer adoption of the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) offering;
•
intense competition in the market for data management, machine learning and analytics platforms;
•
risks and uncertainties regarding Cloudera’s ability to penetrate the existing market for data management, machine learning and
analytics platforms;
•
the belief of the Board of Directors, based upon the course of negotiations with CD&R and KKR (as described in more detail under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “—Background of the Merger”), that the Per Share Merger Consideration represents the highest
price that Parent was willing to pay and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to the Company, in the
aggregate, to which Parent was willing to agree;
•
the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with CD&R and KKR in the event Cloudera sought to pursue discussions with third
parties prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential negative effect that such a process might have on Cloudera’s business,
especially in light of the “go-shop” provision CD&R and KKR was willing to provide that would allow for Cloudera to solicit alternative
acquisition proposals following announcement of the Merger;
•
the high degree of certainty that the closing would be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
the view of the Board of Directors that the Per Share Merger Consideration was more favorable to Cloudera Stockholders on a risk-adjusted
basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to Cloudera, based upon the Board of Directors’
extensive knowledge of Cloudera’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, its competitive position and historical
and projected financial performance, and the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented an attractive and comparatively
certain value for Cloudera Stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for Cloudera on a standalone basis;
•
the fact that Icahn, the Company’s largest stockholder, was supportive of the transaction and prepared to execute and deliver the Voting
Agreement;
•
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing, rendered to the Board of Directors, that as of May 31, 2021, and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to
be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Cloudera common stock, as set forth in such opinion as more
fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley.”
•
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including the following:
•
the right of Cloudera, pursuant to a 30-day “go-shop” period, to solicit Acquisition Proposals (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger

Agreement—The “Go Shop” Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”) from, and participate in discussions and negotiations with, third
parties regarding any Acquisition Proposal, with an additional 10 days to negotiate a definitive agreement with qualifying parties;
•
Cloudera’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions of the
Merger Agreement and paying Parent a termination fee of either (i) $92,472,000 if the Merger Agreement had been terminated during
the Go-Shop Period (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, before the Cut-Off Time) or (ii) $171,734,000, in the case of any other such
termination – amounts which the Board of Directors believed, based upon the advice of its financial and legal advisors, were unlikely
to deter third parties from making Acquisition Proposals;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope, and which, in the case of the
condition related to the accuracy of Cloudera’s representations and warranties, is generally subject to a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Representations
and Warranties”) qualification;
•
the requirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Cloudera common stock;
•
the fact that Cloudera has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to the consummation of the
Merger;
•
the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board of Directors to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and to
terminate the Merger Agreement, in certain circumstances relating to the presence of a Superior Proposal (or to effect a change of
recommendation in response to an intervening event) subject to the applicable procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement (including, if applicable, payment of termination fees) (for more information, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation Change; Company Board Recommendation
Change,” “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement—Termination Fee”);
•
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
•
the end date of March 1, 2022 allowing for sufficient time to complete the Merger;
•
that Parent has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from a reputable financial institution and committed equity financing
for the transaction from certain affiliated funds of Parent that together provide funding of an amount sufficient to cover the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration, all fees and expenses payable by Parent, Merger Sub or Cloudera and the repayment or refinancing of any
indebtedness required to be repaid or refinanced;
•
the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the financing and the limited number and nature of
the conditions to the debt and equity financing;
•
the Company’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters, to specifically enforce
Parent’s obligation to enforce the financing commitments and to cause Parent to cause the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds to fund their
respective contributions as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters;
•
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, Parent will pay the Company a
termination fee of $290,626,000, and the obligation to pay such amounts by the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds, pursuant to the terms of a
limited guaranty, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Financing of the Merger—Equity
Financing” and “—Financing the Merger—Guaranties;” and

•
the fact that the Voting Agreement terminates in the event the Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation in favor of the Merger in
connection with an Intervening Event, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement—The Voting Agreement.”
•
the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law, which provides those eligible
stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or
the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement; and
•
the fact that, in the absence of the Merger, Cloudera would continue to incur significant expenses by remaining a public company, including
legal, accounting, transfer agent, printing and filing fees, and that those expenses could adversely affect Cloudera’s financial performance
and the value of its shares.
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which factors are not
necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
•
the fact that Cloudera would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and stockholders would no longer participate in
any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential future appreciation in value of Cloudera;
•
the risks and costs to Cloudera if the Merger is not completed in a timely manner or at all, including the potential adverse effect on
Cloudera’s ability to attract and retain key personnel, the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential disruptive
effect on Cloudera’s day-to-day operations and Cloudera’s relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, any or all of
which risks and costs, among other things, could adversely affect Cloudera’s overall competitive position and the trading price of its
common stock;
•
the requirement under certain circumstances that Cloudera pay Parent a termination fee following termination of the Merger Agreement,
including if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Cloudera in order to enter into a Superior Proposal or by Parent because the Board of
Directors effects a Company Board Recommendation Change;
•
if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of failure to obtain the Debt Financing (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger”) or as a breach of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies may be
limited to the termination fee payable by Parent described above, which may be inadequate to compensate Cloudera for the damage caused;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Cloudera’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent Cloudera from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Cloudera
might have pursued;
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Cloudera’s stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cloudera is unable to solicit other Acquisition Proposals following the expiration of
the 30-day Go-Shop Period (other than an additional 10 day period to negotiate a definitive agreement with Excluded Parties;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are
payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of Cloudera management required to complete the
Merger, which may disrupt its business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger
Agreement on the trading price of Cloudera common stock;
41
Table of Contents
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents, including under applicable antitrust laws and
foreign investment laws, which clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks;
•
the fact that Cloudera’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of
Cloudera’s stockholders generally (see below under the caption “—Interests of Cloudera’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”);
and
•
the possible loss of key management or other personnel of Cloudera during the pendency of the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement is not meant to be exhaustive but addresses the
material information and factors considered by the Board of Directors in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and
recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and factors described above, individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her
own personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors based its unanimous
recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking
statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Morgan Stanley
Cloudera retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the possible sale of
Cloudera. The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in Cloudera’s industry, its knowledge of Cloudera’s business and affairs and its
understanding of Cloudera’s business based on its long-standing relationship with Cloudera. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on May 31, 2021,
Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of May 31, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in
the written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Cloudera common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of May 31, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its
opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the
opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read
Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as such, and
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera
common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could
be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how Cloudera stockholders should vote
at the special meeting. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.

•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Cloudera;
•

other publicly traded companies comparable with Cloudera, and their securities;
•

participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Cloudera, Parent and their respective financial and legal
advisors;
•
reviewed (i) the Merger Agreement, (ii) the following agreements, in each case, substantially in the form of the draft provided to
Morgan Stanley on May 31, 2021: the Financing Letters, the Guaranties and the Voting Agreement among the stockholders of
Cloudera party thereto and Cloudera, and (iii) certain related documents; and
•
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by Cloudera, and formed a substantial basis for its
opinion. With respect to the Management Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of Cloudera’s management of the future financial performance of Cloudera. Morgan Stanley expressed no
view as to such Management Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,
including among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Financing Letters, and that the definitive
Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the
proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment of Cloudera and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or
whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or
nature of the compensation to any of Cloudera’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the merger. Morgan
Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Cloudera, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with
43
Table of Contents
any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, May 31, 2021. Events occurring after May 31, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and
the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of
its written opinion letter dated as of May 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below
must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon (i) the financial
projections prepared by Cloudera’s management, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts, and (ii) the median
estimates of equity research analysts, which we refer to as the Street Case. The May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts are more fully described below in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “—Management Projections.” In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley
utilized the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to
similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Cloudera with comparable publicly
available consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that
share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or
revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the
“comparable companies”). These companies were the following:

For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for purposes of this analysis, (i)
for Cloudera, (x) were provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use, by Cloudera’s management for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 for
the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts, and (y) were based on the median of publicly available equity analyst research estimates for calendar years 2021
and 2022 for the Street Case; and (ii) for each of the comparable companies, were based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates
for comparison purposes. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total
debt, plus non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents. Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies
and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to revenue
multiples and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for Cloudera. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized
publicly available financial information, available as of May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger).
Based on the outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Cloudera’s management and the selected
ranges of aggregate value to revenue, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Cloudera common stock as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Cloudera. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond Cloudera’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Cloudera’s business and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Cloudera and the
industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of
using comparable company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a
company as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue and levered free cash flow (“LFCF”). The resulting equity value is subsequently
discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present
equity values per share of the Cloudera common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2023 revenue estimates and LFCF estimates under
each of the Street Case and the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan
Stanley applied a forward range of aggregate value to revenue multiples and fully diluted equity value to LFCF multiples (based on the range of aggregate
value to revenue multiples and fully diluted equity value to LFCF multiples for the comparable companies) to these revenue and LFCF estimates in order
to reach a future implied fully diluted equity value.
In each case, Morgan Stanley then added projected net cash to Cloudera’s future implied aggregate value to reach a future implied fully diluted
equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future implied fully diluted equity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with
such estimates provided by Cloudera management) to calculate a per share price. In each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied
future per share price to May 28, 2021, at a discount rate of 8.6 percent, which rate was selected based on Cloudera’s estimated cost of equity, which was
arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted fully diluted equity value.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present
value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share
for the Cloudera common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value Cloudera as a stand-alone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates
from the Street Case and May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization, less (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) cash taxes, (3) changes in net working capital, and (4) capital expenditures. Each of the Street
Case and the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts included estimates through 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use
by Cloudera’s management. The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as of May 28, 2021
at a discount rate ranging from 7.1 percent to 8.9 percent, which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional
judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of Cloudera’s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing
model. In its analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetuity growth rates of 2.5% to 3.5%. Such perpetuity growth rates were selected upon the application
of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgement and experience. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for net cash and further adjusted for the
net present value of net operating losses.

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such
comparable transactions because they shared certain characteristics with the merger, most notably because they were similar software transactions. For
such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the estimated aggregate value of the transaction to the next 12 months (which we refer to as “NTM”) Revenue
based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each such transaction.
The following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each of the transactions listed above and upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of the aggregate value to the estimated NTM Revenue multiples of the
transactions, and applied these ranges of

multiples to the estimated calendar year 2021 NTM Revenue for Cloudera based on the Street Case. The following table summarizes Morgan Stanley’s

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Cloudera or the merger. In evaluating the precedent
transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cloudera’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on
Cloudera’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of Cloudera and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the
aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present
value per share of Cloudera derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the consideration is not necessarily
dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the merger but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but
which were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “—Illustrative Precedent Premiums,” “—Historical Trading Ranges” and “—Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Illustrative Precedent Premiums
Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent premiums analysis by reviewing the same sets of comparable transactions as under the
Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the implied premium to the acquired
company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition
rumors or similar news) and the distributions of the 30-day average premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to
announcement (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar news).
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan
Stanley selected a representative range of premia and applied such range to each of Cloudera’s closing share price on May 28, 2021 (the last full trading
day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger).

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Cloudera common stock prepared and published by equity research
analysts prior to May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger). These targets reflected each
analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of Cloudera common stock. The undiscounted analyst price targets in the 25th to 75th
percentile range for the Cloudera common stock were $14.00 to $16.00 per share as of various dates ranging from March 11, 2021 to April 23, 2021. Morgan
Stanley discounted such range of analyst price targets per share for the Cloudera common stock by one year at a rate of 8.6 percent, which discount rate
was selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect Cloudera’s cost of equity. This analysis
indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for Cloudera common stock of $12.66 to $14.73 per share, as discounted by one year based on
undiscounted analyst price targets, as of May 28, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger).
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for Cloudera
common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Cloudera and future financial market
conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses
for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis
or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan
Stanley’s view of the actual value of Cloudera. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Cloudera’s control.
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Cloudera’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of
any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Cloudera and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates
contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera
49
Table of Contents
common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion
dated as of May 31, 2021 to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Cloudera
common stock might actually trade. The Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Cloudera common stock (other than
the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Cloudera and Parent
and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however,
recommend any specific consideration to Cloudera or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted
the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion
was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how Cloudera stockholders should vote at the special meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of
Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors would have
been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and
other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
The Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global
financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is
engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as
providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a
principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions,
for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of CD&R, KKR and their respective affiliates, or any other
company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided Cloudera financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section
and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the merger, and Cloudera has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately
$58 million for its services, $2.5 million of which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached as this proxy
statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Cloudera has also agreed to reimburse Morgan
Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition,
Cloudera has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with
Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for Cloudera and
received aggregate fees of approximately $10 to 20 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services for CD&R, and certain of its affiliates and their
affiliated funds’ respective portfolio companies (the “CD&R Related Entities”), and for KKR and certain of its affiliates and their affiliated funds’
respective portfolio companies (the “KKR Related Entities”), and have received aggregate fees of approximately $15 to 25 million in connection with such
services from CD&R and the CD&R Related Entities, and fees of greater than approximately $100 million in connection with
50
Table of Contents
such services from KKR and the KKR Related Entities. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Cloudera
and the KKR Related Entities or CD&R Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of
these services.

Summary of Management Projections
Although Cloudera has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning certain aspects of its expected financial performance, it does not, as
a matter of course, make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance for extended periods due to, among
other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove
incorrect. However, in connection with the transaction, Cloudera’s senior management prepared and approved for use certain unaudited prospective
financial information which was provided to and considered by the Board of Directors and which was provided to each of Morgan Stanley, CD&R and
KKR, in each case as set forth herein.
Cloudera’s senior management initially prepared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2020 through 2023
in May 2020 and such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information was discussed with, and approved for use by, the Board of Directors at a
meeting held on May 29, 2020 (the “May 2020 Forecasts”). The May 2020 Forecasts were shared with representatives of CD&R and KKR, along with
other potential bidders, in May and June 2020 in connection with soliciting potential interest in an acquisition of Cloudera.
Cloudera’s senior management subsequently prepared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2021 through
2024 in December 2020 and such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information was discussed with, and approved for use by, the Board of
Directors at a meeting held on December 15, 2020 (the “December 2020 Board Plan”). The December 2020 Board Plan was shared with representatives of
CD&R on January 12, 2021 in connection with their due diligence review of Cloudera.
In March 2021, the December 2020 Board Plan was subsequently adjusted to reflect Cloudera’s actual results for its fiscal year ended January 31,
2021 (the “March 2021 Board Plan”). The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the March 2021 Board Plan during a meeting held on March 16, 2021.
In parallel with preparing the March 2021 Board Plan, Cloudera’s senior management also prepared certain “stretch case” projections which were
provided to CD&R as part of evaluating a potential acquisition of Cloudera and reflected an approximately 15% annual recurring revenue growth rate for
fiscal year 2022 (the “Upside Scenario”). The March 2021 Board Plan and the Upside Scenario were shared with representatives of CD&R on April 12,
2021 in connection with their consideration of the transaction.
In May 2021, the March 2021 Board Plan was further updated to reflect Cloudera’s actual results for its fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021 (the
“May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts”). Morgan Stanley subsequently prepared certain unaudited prospective extrapolations based on the May 2021 Final
Updated Forecasts for the fiscal years 2025 through 2031, which were reviewed and approved for use by Morgan Stanley by Cloudera’s senior
management. The Board of Directors reviewed the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031
with Cloudera’s senior management during its meeting held on May 25, 2021. In connection with such review, the Board of Directors directed Morgan
Stanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031, or a subset thereof, in performing
its financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion, as described in more detail in the section “ - Opinion of Morgan Stanley” above.
The May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts was shared with representatives of CD&R and KKR on May 24, 2021 in connection with their consideration of the
transaction. The related extrapolations for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 and the unlevered free cash flow numbers were not provided to CD&R and
KKR.

We refer to any of the May 2020 Forecasts, the December 2020 Board Plan, the March 2021 Board Plan, the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and
related extrapolated projections for fiscal years 2025 through 2031 and the Upside Scenario as the “Management Projections.” The Management
Projections were prepared by Cloudera on a stand-alone basis and do not take into account the transactions, including any costs incurred in connection
with the transaction or any changes to Cloudera’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the completion of the transaction. As a result,
actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Management Projections.
The information and tables set forth below are included solely to give Cloudera stockholders access to relevant portions of the Management
Projections and are not included in this proxy statement to influence any Cloudera stockholder to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the
transaction or for any other purpose.

Important Information About the Management Projections
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections of prospective financial information. The non-
GAAP financial measures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the
transaction, and the Board of Directors directed Morgan Stanley to use the May 2021 Final Updated Forecasts and the related extrapolations for fiscal
years 2025 through 2031, or a subset thereof, in performing its financial analyses in connection with its financial fairness opinion, as described in more
detail above in the section “– Opinion of Morgan Stanley”. The SEC rules, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to Morgan Stanley or to the Board of Directors in
connection with a proposed business combination like the merger if the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition,
reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial measure were not
53
Table of Contents
relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion or by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and
the merger. Accordingly, Cloudera has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant
GAAP financial measures. In addition, the Management Projections were not prepared with a view towards complying with GAAP. The Management
Projections may differ from published analyst estimates and forecasts and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were
prepared, including the announcement of the merger.
While the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections were based on numerous variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond Cloudera management’s control. Further, given that the Management Projections cover
multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year beyond their preparation. Important factors that may
affect actual results and may result in such projections not being achieved include: risks and uncertainties detailed in Cloudera’s public periodic filings
with the SEC. In addition, the ability to achieve the Management Projections may depend on, in part, whether or not the strategic goals, objectives and
targets are reached over the applicable period. The assumptions upon which the Management Projections were based necessarily involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions and future business decisions
that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies,
including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industry in which Cloudera operates, and
the risks and uncertainties described in the section “–Forward-Looking Statements”, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and
many of which are beyond our control. The Management Projections also reflect assumptions by Cloudera management that are subject to change and
are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for the Cloudera business, changes in general
business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when such
projections were prepared.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may differ, and may differ materially,
from those shown. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Cloudera,
Morgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider the
Management Projections necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the Management Projections should not be relied upon as such. None of
Cloudera, Morgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can give any assurance
that actual results will not differ from the Management Projections. None of Cloudera, Morgan Stanley, CD&R, KKR or any of their respective affiliates,
officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any stockholder of Cloudera or other person regarding the
ultimate performance of Cloudera compared to the information contained in the Management Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved.
In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as
of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Cloudera does not intend to update or otherwise revise the
Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of
future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.
The Management Projections were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Cloudera’s management. Ernst & Young LLP has not audited,
reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Management Projections and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP
does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the stockholders of Cloudera adopt the Merger Agreement, Cloudera’s
stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of
54Table of Contents
Cloudera have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Cloudera’s stockholders generally. The Board of
Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that Cloudera’s stockholders approve the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of this disclosure:
•
The “named executive officers” of Cloudera are:
•
Robert Bearden, Chief Executive Officer;
•
Jim Frankola, Chief Financial Officer; and
•
Arun Murthy, Chief Product Officer.
•
The executive officers of Cloudera since the beginning of Cloudera’s last fiscal year on February 1, 2020 are:
•
the named executive officers; and
•
Mick Hollison, President.
Treatment of Cloudera Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that each Company Option that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration. Each Company Option that is unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or
has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the
Effective Time.
Each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by
its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively.
Each Company RSU Award that vests by its terms at the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Vested RSU
Consideration.
Pursuant to Cloudera’s non-employee director compensation policy, all then-unvested equity awards held by Cloudera’s non-employee directors
will fully vest immediately prior to a change in control (which includes the Merger).
For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards held by named executive officers that would be cancelled in exchange for Merger
consideration assuming that the Merger occurs on June 25, 2021, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Cloudera’s Named Executive
Officers” below.
We estimate that the value of unvested equity awards held by Mr. Hollison (the only executive officer who is not a named executive officer) that
would be cancelled in exchange for Merger consideration assuming that the Merger occurs on June 25, 2021 is $15,804,320. We estimate that the
aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Cloudera that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on June 25,
2021 is $3,191,536.
Cloudera Severance and Change in Control Arrangements
Chief Executive Officer Employment Agreement
Pursuant to Mr. Bearden’s offer letter with Cloudera, Mr. Bearden is entitled to certain payments and benefits upon a termination of employment
effected by Cloudera without “cause” or by Mr. Bearden for “good reason” (each as defined in the offer letter). These payments and benefits will be
subject to Mr. Bearden’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form prescribed by Cloudera.
55
Table of Contents
If the termination occurs during the period commencing three months prior to and ending 12 months following a “change in control” (as defined in
the offer letter, and which includes the Merger), Mr. Bearden will be entitled to receive the following:
•
a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) 18 months of his annual base salary, (ii) his annual target bonus (calculated as if all
applicable bonus targets were achieved), and (iii) a prorated portion of his annual target bonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus
targets were achieved and based on the number of days employed during the bonus period, less any portion previously paid);

COBRA premiums (or a taxable payment in an amount equal to such premiums) until the earlier of the end of an 18-month period or the
date when receiving similar coverage with a new employer; and
•
accelerated vesting of 100% of any then-unvested shares and other equity awards.
In addition, if the successor or acquiring corporation refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Mr. Bearden’s then-unvested shares or other
equity awards in connection with a change in control, the then-unvested shares and other equity awards shall become fully vested effective immediately
prior to the change in control.
Severance and Change in Control Agreements
Cloudera has entered into Severance and Change in Control Agreements (“Severance Agreements”) with each of its executive officers, other than
Mr. Bearden, which entitle the executive officers to certain payments and benefits upon a termination of employment effected by Cloudera without
“cause” or by the executive for “good reason” (each as defined in the applicable Severance Agreement). These payments and benefits will be subject to
the executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form prescribed by Cloudera.
If the termination occurs during the period commencing three months prior to and ending 24 months following a “change in control” (as defined in
the Severance Agreements, and which includes the Merger), the executive officer will be entitled to receive the following:
•
a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the executive’s then-current base salary, (ii) the executive’s then-current annual target
bonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus targets were achieved, and to the extent the target bonus is paid more frequently than
annually, bonus amounts will be aggregated to represent a full year), and (iii) a prorated portion of the executive’s then-current annual
target bonus (calculated as if all applicable bonus targets were achieved and based on the number of days worked during the bonus
period, less any portion previously paid, and to the extent the target bonus is paid more frequently than annually, bonus amounts will
be aggregated to represent a full year);
•
up to 12 months of COBRA premiums (or a taxable payment in an amount equal to such premiums);
•
accelerated vesting of 100% of all outstanding equity awards (and with respect to awards that would otherwise vest upon satisfaction
of performance criteria, this acceleration will apply at the target level of the performance criteria unless specifically provided otherwise
in the equity award agreement); and
•
a 12-month post-termination exercise window for all outstanding non-qualified stock options.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cloudera’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and
coverage for a period of six (6) years following the effective time under
56
Table of Contents
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the surviving corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the
section captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”
New Compensation Arrangements with Parent
Any Cloudera executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the closing of the Merger may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may
participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, no compensation arrangements between such persons and Parent and/or its affiliates have been established.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Cloudera’s Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Cloudera’s named executive officers would receive in connection with
the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on June 25, 2021
(which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); (ii) a per share price of Cloudera common stock of
$16.00 (the Per Share Merger Consideration); (iii) that each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from
those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement; and (iv) equity awards that are outstanding as of June 25, 2021. The calculations in the table below
do not include any amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these
amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. As a result of the
foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to
the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ materially from the amounts set forth below.
For purposes of this discussion, “single trigger” refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double trigger”
refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying termination. Payments of double trigger benefits
are contingent on the named executive officer signing and not revoking a release of claims in favor of Cloudera, as described above under “—Cloudera
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements.”

Cash. For Mr. Bearden, represents the double trigger cash severance that he is eligible to receive pursuant to his offer letter upon a qualifying
termination of employment that occurs within the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a change in control (which
includes the Merger), equal to the sum of (i) 18 months of his annual base salary, (ii) his annual target bonus, and (iii) a prorated portion of his
annual target bonus (based on the number of days employed during the bonus period), less any portion that has already been paid.

Equity. Under the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively, that vests on the original time-based vesting schedule of the related
Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance requirement). Even though payment of the PSU Consideration
is subject to the time-based vesting schedule of the related Company PSU Award, because the PSU Consideration is no longer subject to the
performance-based vesting schedule of the related Company PSU Award, the PSU Consideration may constitute a single trigger benefit. Under the
double trigger arrangements in Mr. Bearden’s offer letter and the other executive officers’ Severance Agreements, each named executive officer is
eligible to receive 100% vesting acceleration for their outstanding Cloudera equity awards upon a qualifying termination of employment that occurs
within the period beginning three months before and ending 24 months (or, for Mr. Bearden, 12 months) after a change in control, as described
above under “— Cloudera Severance and Change in Control Arrangements”, and this accelerated vesting applies to the RSU Consideration and
the PSU Consideration. The amount reported represents the value of Merger consideration that would be received in respect of Company RSU
Awards and Company PSU Awards upon a qualifying termination. No named executive officer holds unvested Company Options.
The following table quantifies the value of the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration included in the aggregate total reported in the
column. As noted above, only the amounts listed under “Unvested PSUs” could be considered a single trigger benefit.

Perquisites/Benefits. Represents the estimated value of Cloudera-paid COBRA continuation benefits. Under the double trigger arrangements in Mr.
Bearden’s offer letter and the other named executive officers’ Severance Agreements described in footnote (1) above, Mr. Bearden is eligible to
receive up to 18 months of Cloudera-paid COBRA continuation benefits, and each other named executive officer is eligible to receive up to 12
months of Cloudera-paid COBRA continuation benefits, respectively.

Total. This amount includes the aggregate dollar value of the sum of all amounts reported in the preceding columns. In the event any payment or
benefit received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger would be subject to excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the
Code, the amount of such payments or benefits provided would be reduced, but only to the extent such reduction results in a greater after-tax
benefit to the named executive officer.

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid at the closing of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, will be approximately $5.3 billion. This amount
includes funds needed to: (1) pay Cloudera Stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their Cloudera common stock, (2) make
payments in respect of our outstanding Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards at closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
(3) make payments in respect of our outstanding Company Options payable at closing of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (4) to
refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company (collectively, the “Required Amounts”).
Parent and Merger Sub have obtained committed financing consisting of (i) equity to be provided by the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) debt financing to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter by the lenders
party thereto. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to Cloudera copies of the Financing Letters.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters, the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds have committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to
Parent at the closing of the Merger an aggregate amount in cash equal to $3.0 billion for the purpose of funding the Required Amounts. The obligations
of the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds to provide the equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letters are subject to a number of conditions,
including, but not limited to: (i) satisfaction or written waiver by Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, of each the conditions to the obligations
of Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of the Merger Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder)
of such conditions), (ii) the prior or substantially concurrent receipt of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or confirmation
that the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will be funded at the closing of the Merger if the equity financing under the Equity
Commitment Letters is consummated at the closing of the Merger, (iii) written confirmation from Cloudera that if the equity financing and debt financing
are funded, then Cloudera will take such actions required of it to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and (iv)
the prior or substantially concurrent funding by the other fund of such fund’s equity commitment. We refer to the equity financing described in the
preceding sentence as the “Equity Financing.”
The obligation of the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the
earliest to occur of: (i) the consummation of the closing of the Merger and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the payment
or provision for the other Required Amounts in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (ii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, (iii) a court declining to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific
performance brought against Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (iv) the termination of the other fund’s Equity Commitment Letter or
Guaranty or (v) the assertion of a claim or legal proceeding by the Cloudera Group or any of their Representatives (as defined in the Equity Commitment
Letters), under or in respect of the Merger Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions contemplated thereby against Parent, the CD&R Funds, the
KKR Funds, or any of their affiliates, subject to the exceptions, terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letters and the
Guaranties.
Cloudera is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the

Funds and the KKR Funds to perform its funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case subject to (i) the limitations and
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing
The Debt Commitment Letter provides that the lenders party thereto will provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, in the aggregate up to $2.39 billion in debt financing (not all of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the Merger), consisting
of the following:
•
$1.64 billion senior secured first lien term loan facility;
•
$250 million senior secured first lien revolving credit facility; and
•
$500 million senior secured second lien term loan facility.
We refer to the debt financing described above as the “Debt Financing.” The proceeds of the Debt Financing will be used on the Closing Date (i) to
effect the Merger and related transactions on the Closing Date, including repayment in full and termination of Cloudera’s existing credit facility, (ii) for
working capital purposes (including to refinance any indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes) and to replace, backstop or cash collateralize
certain existing letters of credit (if any) of Cloudera or its subsidiaries and (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Merger and related transactions.
The obligations of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to
a number of conditions, including, but not limited to (as applicable):

Guaranties
Pursuant to the Guaranties, the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds have agreed to guarantee the due, punctual and complete payment and
performance of: (1) the aggregate amount of the Parent Termination Fee (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Termination Fee”) solely if and
when any of the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (2) enforcement expenses due by Parent pursuant to legal
proceedings as a result of certain defaults under the Merger Agreement, not to exceed $5 million in the aggregate; and (3) the reimbursement obligations
of Parent pursuant to the indemnification obligations to Cloudera and its representatives in connection with debt financing, not to exceed $1 million in the
aggregate. We refer to the obligations set forth in the preceding sentence as the “Guaranteed Obligations.” The obligations of the CD&R Funds and the
KKR Funds under the Guaranties are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $296.6 million.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Guaranties will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
the closing of the Merger;

•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, other than a termination pursuant to which Cloudera would be
entitled to a Parent Termination Fee under the Merger Agreement, in which case the Guaranties shall terminate 60 days after such
termination unless Cloudera shall have commenced a legal proceeding against Parent, the CD&R Funds or the KKR Funds alleging the
Parent Termination Fee is due and owing prior to such 60th day; provided that if the Merger Agreement has been so terminated and such
legal proceeding has been filed, the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds, as the guarantor entities under the Guaranties, shall have no further
liability or obligation under the Guaranties from and after the earliest of (x) a final, non-appealable resolution of such legal proceeding, (y) a

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cloudera common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL
(“Section 262”). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal
61Table of Contents
rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated
herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of
Cloudera common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Cloudera common stock is entitled to demand
appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Cloudera common stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Cloudera common stock through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their
shares; (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective
Time; and (iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
court. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who
have asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of Cloudera common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Cloudera common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million
(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for
good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the
Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an
amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is
under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes
Cloudera’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or
who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of Cloudera common stock, Cloudera believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder
should seek the advice of legal counsel.
62
Table of Contents
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Cloudera common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Cloudera a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose
appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Cloudera common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of
the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and
has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not
vote its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Cloudera, before the vote on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand
for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A
holder of shares of Cloudera common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is
made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will,
unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will
nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights
must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of Cloudera Stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Cloudera common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Cloudera common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably
inform Cloudera of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the
Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be
executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in
common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must
63
Table of Contents
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO
EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A
PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR
OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has delivered a written demand to Cloudera and who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to
the Merger Agreement by delivering to Cloudera a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand
made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court
of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
Per Share Merger Consideration within 60 days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and Cloudera, as the Surviving
Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder
who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised
value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share merger consideration being
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of Cloudera common
stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has
complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of
a petition filed by a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of
64
Table of Contents
the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present
intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect
to the fair value of the shares of Cloudera common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who desire to have their shares
appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Cloudera common stock within the time and in
the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Cloudera common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262
could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Cloudera common stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262
and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Cloudera has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting
stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Cloudera common stock held either in a voting trust or
by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the
foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Cloudera common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly
verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the
value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and
place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described
above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the
Surviving Corporation. After notice to stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the
petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Cloudera common stock entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above
has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the “fair value” of the shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment.
However, at any time
65
Table of Contents
before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior
to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the
Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s
exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an
opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair
value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a
value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither Cloudera nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per
Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Cloudera and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash
payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share
of Cloudera common stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership
thresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the
appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Cloudera common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses
or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Cloudera common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to
appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been
satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
66
Table of Contents
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Cloudera common
stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s
shares of Cloudera common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither
of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to the stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time
or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for
appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",68,74

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Cloudera common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
the Merger, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax
laws, and any applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in
this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax
considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.
This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Cloudera common stock as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to
special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
67Table of Contents
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting;
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
tax-qualified retirement plans;
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds;
•
holders that are holding shares of Cloudera common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction
or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations” or any other pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
•
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Cloudera common stock (by vote or value);
•
holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to their shares as a result of such income being
recognized on an applicable financial statement;
•
grantor trusts;
•
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal
income tax;
•
persons who hold or received Cloudera common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option, in connection with a
restricted stock unit award or company performance stock unit award or otherwise in a compensatory transaction;
•
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
•
holders that hold their Cloudera common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or
resident outside the United States; and
•
holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and that properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of
Cloudera common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the
activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of
Cloudera common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER
WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH
RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
68
Table of Contents
U.S. Holders
This section applies to “U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of Cloudera common stock that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Cloudera common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
received in the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Cloudera common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S.
Holder. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Cloudera common stock. A U.S.
Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Cloudera common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the
Merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Cloudera common stock (shares of Cloudera
common stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to
them.
Non-U.S. Holders
This section applies to “Non-U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Cloudera common
stock that is not a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized in connection with the Merger, unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States);
•
the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of shares of Cloudera common stock pursuant to the Merger and certain other requirements are met; or
•
shares of Cloudera common stock constitute a United States real property interest (“USRPI”) by reason of Cloudera’s status as a United
States real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and one or more other conditions are satisfied.
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular rates. A Non-
U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such
lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.
69
Table of Contents
A Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized in connection with the Merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the
Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal
income tax returns with respect to such losses.
We believe that Cloudera is not currently, has not been during the preceding five years and prior to or at the time of the Merger does not expect to
become, a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether Cloudera is a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of Cloudera’s USRPIs relative to the
fair market value of Cloudera’s non-USRPIs and other business assets, there can be no assurance that Cloudera is not or will not become a USRPHC. A
non-U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor about the consequences that could result if Cloudera is or were to become a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting generally will apply to payments to a U.S. Holder in connection with the Merger. Backup withholding generally will apply to
the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject
to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.
Information reporting and backup withholding generally will apply to the proceeds of a disposition of shares of Cloudera common stock in the
Merger by a non-U.S. Holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies, on a properly completed
applicable IRS Form W-8, its status as a non-U.S. Holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. For information
reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with certain connections with the United States will be treated in a manner
similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the
information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.
Copies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is incorporated
under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding generally will be allowed as a credit against a holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL
CHANGES OR INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET
FORTH THEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TAX ADVICE. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF
ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION AND HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH
MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

"Cloudera, Inc._20210719_DEFM14A_19410828_4260317.Pdf",Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Cloudera and Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain
limitations, to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
These approvals include approval under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until Cloudera and Parent each file a Notification and
Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable waiting
period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting
period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the FTC or
DOJ issues a request for additional information and documents (which we refer to as the “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting
period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the
Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.
Cloudera and Sky Parent Inc. each filed a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ on June 15, 2021. The
waiting period with respect to such Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on July 15, 2021.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We
cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Approvals
The Merger is also subject to clearance or approval by the antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions and other relevant authorities under foreign
investment laws. The Merger cannot be completed until Cloudera and Parent obtain clearance to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting
periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions. Cloudera and Parent, in consultation and cooperation with each other, made an antitrust
filing with the authorities of such jurisdiction.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary
and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire
Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger
Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by
this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (i) were made only for
purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be
subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the
purpose of allocating contractual risk between Cloudera, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to
standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under
the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Cloudera, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In
addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Cloudera, Parent and
Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger
Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger
Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide
any other factual information regarding Cloudera, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties,

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Closing Date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Closing and Effective Time”): (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Cloudera, with Cloudera becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; (ii) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease; and (iii)
Cloudera will continue as the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Cloudera and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of Cloudera and Merger Sub will become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.
At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of Cloudera as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are duly appointed. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Cloudera as the Surviving Corporation will
be amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of
72Table of Contents
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will
become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended.
Closing and Effective Time
The closing of the Merger will take place remotely at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption, “—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”) (other than those conditions to be
satisfied at the closing of the Merger) or such other time agreed to in writing by Parent, Cloudera and Merger Sub. However, if a specified marketing
period (being the first period of fifteen (15) business days following the date on which Parent has been provided the financial information regarding
Cloudera required by the Debt Commitment Letter), has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the Merger (other
than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger), the closing of the Merger will then occur on the date that is the earlier of (i) any
business day during such marketing period specified by Parent to Cloudera on no less than two (2) business days’ notice to Cloudera and (ii) the third
business day after the final day of such marketing period. The date on which the closing of the Merger occurs is herein referred to as the “Closing Date.”
On the Closing Date, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.
The Merger will become effective at the Effective Time.

and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration. Each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.
Each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest by
its terms at the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the RSU Consideration and the PSU Consideration, respectively,
payable on the same time-based vesting schedule as the related Company RSU Award and Company PSU Award (without regard to any performance
requirement). Each Company RSU Award that vests by its terms at the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Vested
RSU Consideration.
In connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Cloudera took the following actions under the ESPP: (i) ensured no new
participants will commence participation in the ESPP after June 1, 2021; (ii) ensured no participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll
contribution rate in effect as of June 1, 2021 or make separate non-payroll contributions on or following such date; and (iii) ensured no new offering
period or purchase period will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after June 1, 2021. If the Effective Time is expected to occur
prior to the end of the current purchase period, Cloudera
73Table of Contents
must provide for an earlier exercise date (including for purposes of determining the purchase price for the current purchase period). Such earlier exercise
date will be as close to the Effective Time as is administratively practicable. The ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than
immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time.

"Cloudera, Inc._20210719_DEFM14A_19410828_4260317.Pdf",Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will select a transfer agent or such other bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to Cloudera (the
“Payment Agent”) to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders.
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) business days), the Payment Agent will mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) a letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder’s shares
of Cloudera common stock represented by such holder’s certificate(s) or book-entry shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such shares. The amount of any Per Share Merger Consideration paid to stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the Payment Agent is not claimed within one (1) year following the Effective Time, such cash will be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Cloudera common stock who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the Merger
Agreement will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any cash
deposited with the Payment Agent that remains unclaimed two (2) years following the Effective Time will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the No Shop Period Start Date, Cloudera, its affiliates and their
respective representatives had the right to: (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce, encourage or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of, or

and equity financing sources and/or their respective representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Cloudera Group, in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal (or any proposal or inquiry that could constitute or is reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), provided that
Cloudera will substantially concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), provide to Parent, or provide Parent access to, any such non-
public information that has not been previously provided to Parent or its representatives, and the Cloudera Group must not provide any competitively
sensitive non-public information to any third person who is or has one or more affiliates that is a competitor of any Cloudera Group Member except in

third person to submit or amend an Acquisition Proposal on a confidential basis to the Board of Directors.
If Cloudera had terminated the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into a definitive agreement with any Excluded Party prior to the No
Shop Period Start Date in respect of a Superior Proposal, Cloudera would have been required to pay a termination fee of $92,472,000 to Parent, so long as
the Company has complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Board
Recommendation Change.”
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with the Company that is either (i) in effect as of the date hereof; or (ii) executed,
delivered and effective after the date hereof, in either case containing provisions that require any counterparty thereto (and any of its affiliates and
representatives named therein) that receive non-public information of or with respect to the Company to keep such information confidential (subject to
customary exceptions); provided, however, that, other than with respect to any immaterial provisions, the provisions contained therein are not less
favorable to the Company in any material respect than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such agreement need not
contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or that otherwise prohibit the making of any Acquisition Proposal). For the avoidance of doubt, a joinder to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to which a third party agrees to be bound by the confidentiality and use provisions of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement shall be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
80Table of Contents
“Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Transaction.
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) involving:
(1)
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any third person or “group” (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) of persons, whether from Cloudera or any other person(s), of securities representing more than 20% of the total outstanding voting
power of Cloudera after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer by any person or “group” of persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or
“group” of persons beneficially owning more than 20% of the total outstanding voting power of Cloudera after giving effect to the
consummation of such tender or exchange offer;
(2)
any direct or indirect purchase, exclusive license or other acquisition by any third person or “group” (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) of persons of assets constituting or accounting for more than 20% of the consolidated assets, revenue or net income
of the Cloudera Group, taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or
(3)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving
Cloudera pursuant to which (x) any third person or “group” (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons would
hold securities representing more than 20% of the total outstanding voting power of Cloudera outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction or (y) the stockholders of Cloudera immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the
equity interests of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction.
“Excluded Party” means any third person (i) who submits a written offer or proposal that constitutes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal to the
Company or any of its representatives after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (ii) whose Acquisition
Proposal is determined by the Company Board, in good faith, prior to the start of the No-Shop Period Start Date (after consultation with its outside
counsel and its financial advisor), to be, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that a third person shall
immediately cease to be an Excluded Party (and the provisions of the Merger Agreement applicable to Excluded Parties shall cease to apply with respect
to such person) if (1) such Acquisition Proposal is withdrawn by such third person or (2) such Acquisition Proposal, in the good faith determination of
the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor), no longer is, or would no longer be reasonably expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal.
“Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction that (i) was not the result or effect of a
violation of Section 5.3(b) of the Merger Agreement and (ii) is on terms that the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all legal, regulatory and financing aspects of the proposal
(including certainty of closing), the identity of the Person making the proposal and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
deems relevant, if consummated, would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company Stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the
Transactions (taking into account any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination
in accordance with Section 5.3(b) of the Merger Agreement). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal” in this definition, all references
to (x) “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%” and (y) “80%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%”.

From the date of the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time) until the earlier to occur of the termination
of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the Cloudera Group Members will not, will cause their respective officers and directors not to, and will
use reasonable best efforts to cause their other respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
furnish to any third person any non-public information relating to the Cloudera Group or afford to any third person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Cloudera Group, in any such case with the
intent to induce, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage,

to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
participate or engage in discussions, communications or negotiations with any third person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or

In addition, Cloudera has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any third person and its representatives
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the
Cloudera Group furnished to any person with whom a confidentiality agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal was entered into at any time
within the nine (9) month period immediately preceding the No Shop Period Start Date and will cease providing any further information with respect to
Cloudera or any Acquisition Proposal to any such third person or its representatives and will immediately terminate all access granted to any such third
person or its representatives to any physical or electronic data room (or any other diligence access). Cloudera has also agreed to enforce, and not to
waive, terminate or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the
Board of Directors, unless the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, Cloudera may continue to engage in the activities delineated in the previous two paragraphs with respect to
any Excluded Party (but only for so long as such person is and remains an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended or modified
Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the No Shop Period Start Date.
Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, from the No Shop Period Start Date until the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera
Stockholders, Cloudera and the Board of Directors may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives, participate or engage in
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Cloudera Group pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any person
(or its representatives) that had made of delivered to the Company a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition Proposal
or assist such person (and its representatives, prospective debt and equity financing sources and/or their respective representatives) with such
Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person) and such Acquisition Proposal did not result from any material breach of Cloudera’s
non-solicitation obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement (provided that Cloudera and its
82Table of Contents
representatives may contact any third person in writing to clarify any ambiguous terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal which are necessary to

the subsequent paragraph, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably likely lead to a Superior Proposal, and,
in each case, the failure to take such actions in respect of such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors’ fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.
Both during the Go Shop Period and after the No Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera’s
stockholders, Cloudera is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal
unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a five (5)-
business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a
“Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
If Cloudera terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera Stockholders for the purpose of entering
into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, Cloudera must pay a $171,734,000 termination fee to Parent, so long as the Company has complied in
all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.",89,90

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of
shares of Cloudera common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors
will not effect a Company Board Recommendation Change except as described below.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Cloudera Stockholders, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the
following (any such action, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the recommendation of
the Board of Directors to approve the Merger, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect (it being understood that it
will be considered a modification adverse to Parent that is material if (i) any Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is
commenced and the Board of Directors fails to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by stockholders
within ten business days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (ii) any Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced (other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the Board of Directors fails to issue a public press release
within ten business days of such public announcement providing that the Board of Directors reaffirms the Cloudera recommendation);
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or propose to adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable) an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger within ten business days after Parent so
requests in writing (it being understood that Cloudera will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two separate
occasions); or
•
fail to include the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger in this proxy statement.

For the avoidance of doubt, none of the following, among other things, will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change: (i) a “stop, look
and listen” communication by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to Cloudera Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication), (ii) the factually accurate public disclosure by Cloudera of the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal if, and only to the extent required by applicable law, (iii) the determination by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, solely to the extent such determination is not publicly disclosed by Cloudera or its representatives, or (iv)
delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice related to an Intervening Event (as defined in this section of this proxy statement below) or Superior
Proposal as set forth below.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board of Directors may
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (i) there has been an Intervening Event; or (ii) Cloudera has received a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, whether before or after the No Shop Period Start Date, that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, in each case, to the extent a failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary obligations under applicable law.
The Board of Directors may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if:
•
Cloudera has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance to the effect that the Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which notice must
specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change, including a description of the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Cloudera and its representatives, during such five business-day period,
must have (i) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent
to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties to obviate the
need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event; and (ii) taken into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties proposed by Parent and
other information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in the foregoing clause directly above, in each case that are
offered in writing by Parent no later than 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the last day of the five business-day period, in a manner that would
constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by Cloudera; and
•
following the five business-day notice period described above, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement) shall have determined in good faith that the failure of the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company
Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
provided, that each time material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, Cloudera must notify Parent of such modification and the
five-business-day period described above will recommence and be extended for three (3) business days from the day of such notification.
In addition, the Board of Directors may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or authorize Cloudera to terminate the Merger
Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement in

the Merger Agreement absent any revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for
such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the person or “group” of persons making such

“group” of persons that was in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement), the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal;

prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Cloudera and its representatives, during the five business
day notice period described above, have: (i) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
so negotiate) to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties
so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (ii) taken into account any adjustments to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59
p.m. (Pacific time) on the last day of the five day notice period described above, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement
between the parties if accepted by Cloudera, provided, however, that in the event of any material modifications to such Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), Cloudera will
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this clause (it being understood that the “notice
period” in respect of such new written notice will be three (3) business days);

terminate the Merger Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and
•
in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit the Cloudera Group to enter into an acquisition
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, Cloudera will have validly terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, so long as the Company has complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth
in the Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, including paying to Parent a termination fee of either (i) $92,472,000 if the
Merger Agreement had been terminated before the No Shop Period Start Date for the purposes of entering into a definitive agreement in
respect of a Superior Proposal with any Excluded Party, or (ii) $171,734,000, in the case of any other such termination.

The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Cloudera will, and Parent will cause Cloudera to, honor all Cloudera
employee plans (each, an “Employee Plan”) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if sooner, on the date of termination of employment of the relevant
Cloudera employee who continues to be an employee following the consummation of the Merger (such employee, a “Continuing Employee”)), Parent will
provide, or cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee, (i) cash compensation and severance arrangements, each on a basis no less favorable
than that in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension,
nonqualified deferred compensation and retiree or post-termination welfare benefits or compensation (the “Excluded Benefits”)) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
All Continuing Employees will be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s health and welfare benefit plans (to the same
extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate under the health and welfare benefits plans of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time); however, (i) Parent, its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate, in accordance with its terms, any benefit or
compensation arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, subject to the requirements set forth in the

Effective Time occurs, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s (or a subsidiary’s) health and welfare
benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time.
To the extent that service is relevant under any benefit plan of Parent or subsidiary of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (excluding any plan
or arrangement that provides any Excluded Benefit), then Parent shall generally ensure that such benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting, credit Continuing Employees for their years of service recognized by the Cloudera Group Member prior to the Effective Time with
the Cloudera Group Member or their respective predecessors. With respect to any group medical plans maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries in which
the Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and any of its subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements under any such group health plans to the same extent waived or satisfied under any
corresponding Employee Plan of a Cloudera Group Member in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under such group health plans in the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time under the
Employee Plans maintained by a Cloudera Group Member.

Parent, Merger Sub and Cloudera agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties do not timely perform the provisions of the Merger Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions
as are required of it in order to consummate the Merger Agreement). Parent, Merger Sub and Cloudera acknowledge and agree that: (1) the parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof; (2) the fees and
expenses provisions of the Merger Agreement are not intended to and would not adequately compensate Cloudera, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (3) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither Cloudera nor Parent would have entered into the Merger Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that,
subject to the limitations of the next two sentences, Cloudera will have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the financing to be funded (including to cause
Parent to enforce the obligations of the CD&R Funds and the KKR Funds under the Equity

subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any financing under the terms thereof, none of Cloudera and its affiliates and their
direct and indirect equityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of the Merger Agreement against any financing source.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of Cloudera to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion of
the amount required to consummate the Merger and to make all payments required to be made in connection therewith (but not the right of Cloudera to
seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the (x) joint
conditions to Parent, Merger Sub and Cloudera’s obligations to consummate the Merger and (y) conditions to Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to
consummate the Merger, in each case, have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof if the Equity Financing is funded and (iii) Cloudera has
irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required
of it by this Agreement to consummate the closing of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Parent, Merger Sub and Cloudera agree not to raise any objections to (1) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by Cloudera, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand; and (2) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right
that it will have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Cloudera is required to submit a proposal to our
stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Cloudera’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation
is summarized in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Cloudera in the Merger.” The Board of Directors
encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly,
Cloudera is asking you to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Cloudera approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or may become payable to
Cloudera’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the
section captioned ‘The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Cloudera in the Merger.’”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the
vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Cloudera. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger
is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this
Compensation Proposal.
Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation
Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of Cloudera
common stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present.
Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation
Proposal, (ii) abstentions will be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote against the Compensation Proposal and (iii)
broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Cloudera common stock represented by properly
executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Cloudera Stockholder returns a
signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Cloudera common stock represented by that proxy will be
counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended
by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment
proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including soliciting proxies from Cloudera Stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the
Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn
the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at
the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt resolutions and take all other actions as may be required to provide that

take action to provide for an earlier exercise date (including for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) for the current
Purchase Period (such earlier date, the “Early ESPP Exercise Date”)). The Early ESPP Exercise Date will be as close to the Effective Time as is
administratively practicable. The ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time
(but subject to the consummation of the Merger).

"Cloudera, Inc._20210719_DEFM14A_19410828_4260317.Pdf",Exchange of Certificates,"Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a transfer agent or such other bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to
the Company, to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which such holders of Company Common Stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Dissenting Company Shares) become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7 (the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
A-20Table of Contents
level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for
distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment
of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the
“Certificates”) and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.10(c), uncertificated Shares that represented outstanding Shares (other than
Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”): (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent, subject to
the last sentence of this Section 2.10(c)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange
for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented
by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will
forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder’s
transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share
Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.10(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without
interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and
the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then
the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to
(A) the number of Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if
the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
A-21
Table of Contents
surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the
applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate
thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to
this Section 2.10 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to
the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates

Third Person in writing (with a request that any response from such Third Person is in writing) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify

outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably likely lead to a Superior Proposal, and
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(c) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law; and provided further, that the Company will provide to Parent and its Representatives any non-public information that is provided to any
Person or its Representatives given such access that was not previously made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with (but in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after) the time it is provided to such Person.

respect to any Excluded Parties, if applicable)) may the Company Board (or a committee thereof):
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect (it being understood that it shall be
considered a modification adverse to Parent that is material if (1) any Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced
and the Company Board fails to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders within ten
(10) Business Days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (2) any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced
(other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer)) and the Company Board fails to issue a public press release within ten (10)
Business Days of such public announcement providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation; (B) adopt,
approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or propose to adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable)
an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two (2) separate occasions); or (D)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (D), a “Company Board
Recommendation Change”); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) a “stop, look and listen” communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication), (2) the factually accurate public disclosure by the Company of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal if, and
only to the extent, required by applicable Law, (3) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, solely to the extent such determination is not publicly disclosed by the Company or its Representatives, or (4) the
delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e), will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:
(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change of the type described in
clauses (A), (C) and (D) of the definition thereof in response to any material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that was (A) not
known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board as of the date hereof; and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal (or any
proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal); or (b) the fact, in and of itself, that the
Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date hereof in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock or the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause
(b) may be considered and taken into account) (each such event, an “Intervening Event”), if the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law and if and only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days (the “Event Notice Period”)
in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change,
including a description of the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, during
such Event Notice Period, must have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters and/or the Guaranties to obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, in response to such
Intervening Event and (B) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters
and/or the Guaranties proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in clause (1)
of this Section 5.3(e)(i), in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the last day of the
Event Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by the Company; and
(3) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties) shall have determined in good faith that the failure of the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; provided that each time material modifications to the Intervening Event occur,
the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(i)(3)
with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the “Event Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will
be three (3) Business Days).
(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the

and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law;
(2) the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all material respects with their obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the “Proposal
Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C)
resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent
any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Proposal
Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so
negotiate) to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties so
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (2) taken into account any adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties proposed by Parent and other information
provided by Parent during the Proposal Notice Period, in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m.
(Pacific time) on the last day of the Proposal Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the
parties if accepted by the Company; provided, however, that in the event of any material modifications to such Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company
will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect
to such new written notice (it being understood that the “Proposal Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be three
(3) Business Days);
(4) following such Proposal Notice Period, including any subsequent Proposal Notice Period as provided in the final
proviso of the foregoing Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3), the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and
(5) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 5.3(e).

supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”). Subject to Section 5.3, the Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
(b) Other Required Company Filing. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with
the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company
Filing”), then the Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with
the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the
Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required
Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of

the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filing. The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
(d) Furnishing Information. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all
information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the
SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting or any such filing, any information relating to the Company Group, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered
by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate
Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.
(e) Consultation Prior to Certain Communications. The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such written communication, and each Party will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto
by the other Parties or their respective counsel.
(f) Notices. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other

Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and
confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement, which confirmation will be deemed to occur if
the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the tenth calendar day after filing the Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be
reviewing the Proxy Statement (the “SEC Clearance Date”); provided, that the Company shall not be required to disseminate the Proxy Statement to the
Company Stockholders prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, if applicable, the Cut-Off Time).

requested by Parent on no more than two (2) occasions, shall for a reasonable period of time not to exceed ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate)
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present

Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times pursuant to this clause (i) without Parent’s prior written
consent); or (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or

Change.
6.5 Financing.
(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and the Guarantors to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing
on the terms (including the market “flex” provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters (or on other terms and conditions that are acceptable to parent,
subject to the Prohibited Financing Modifications), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain (and cause each Guarantor to maintain) in effect
and comply with the Financing Letters and, to the extent entered into prior to the Closing, the definitive agreements relating to the Financing in a timely
and diligent manner (subject to Parent’s or Merger Sub’s right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign, substitute, waive or amend the Financing
Letters in accordance herewith), (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms (including the market
“flex” provisions) and subject to those conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on other terms and conditions that are acceptable to
Parent, subject to the Prohibited Financing Modifications), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Closing and the
Marketing Period) (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions applicable to (and within control of) Parent and Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and, to the
extent entered into prior to the Closing, the definitive agreements relating to the Financing (including by consummating the Equity Financing at or
immediately prior to the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters), (iv) upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger, consummate the Financing and cause the Financing
Sources, each Guarantor and the other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the
Financing Letters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (x) seek the Equity Financing from
any source other than the Guarantors, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters, or (y) incur or pay any fees to
obtain a waiver of any term of the Debt Commitment Letter or pay any material fees that are, in the aggregate, in excess of those contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letter (including any market “flex” provisions contained therein).
(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (x) agree to or permit any termination of
A-58
Table of Contents
or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Equity Commitment Letters or (y) subject to the
last sentence of this paragraph, agree to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any
provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Redacted Fee Letter if, in the case of this clause (y), such termination, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement unless
the amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) such that the Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, would
not have sufficient available funds necessary to pay the Required Amounts, (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the
Debt Financing or expand or amend or modify any of the existing conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, in each case, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur or prevent or materially hinder or delay the Closing, (C) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur or prevent or materially hinder or delay the
Closing or (D) otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially hinder or delay the Closing (the foregoing clauses (A) through (D), collectively,
the “Prohibited Financing Modifications”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement or modification to effectuate any “market flex”
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and/or Redacted Fee Letter provided as of the date hereof or to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities (or titles with respect to such entities) thereto shall be permitted and shall not require written
consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any written amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver to
or under any Financing Letter promptly upon execution thereof.
(c) Parent shall, upon Company’s reasonable request, keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, upon Company’s reasonable request, provide to the Company complete, correct and executed
copies of the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice of (i) any
material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware, (ii) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual
or alleged (in writing) material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters of any provisions of
the Financing Letters and (iii) the occurrence of an event or development that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the Closing Date. Additionally, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence,
subject to applicable legal privilege or confidentiality obligations.
(d) Without limiting Parent or Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder, if all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any applicable market “flex” provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and such portion is necessary to
fund the Required Amount, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to

director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise

payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) and out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and all other out-of-pocket costs relating to or resulting from
such D&O Claim. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall advance costs and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) as incurred by any Covered Person in connection with any D&O Claim promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days) after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined (after exhausting all available appeals) that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification. Any Covered Person wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any claim, action or
proceeding in respect of which such indemnification will be sought, shall notify Parent thereof in writing; provided, that the failure to so notify the
Surviving Corporation shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this Section 6.10(a), except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation or Parent. In the event of any such D&O Claim, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Covered Person in the defense of any such D&O Claim. All rights to the indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date

hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.10(b) shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such D&O Claim. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the Agreement Date with any of the
Covered Persons shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with

Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall
survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals
as the Company Group’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time for D&O
Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided that the premium for such tail policy shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company Group for such insurance (such amount being the
“Maximum Premium”). If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may obtain such a
tail policy; provided, however, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy
cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Surviving Corporation

policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder.

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) sells all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall

their respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that each Covered Person (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be
a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.10(e). In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 6.10(e), the Surviving

Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s (or a Subsidiary’s) health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage
under such plans is replacing analogous coverage under an Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any benefit plan of Parent or Subsidiary of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation

for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, credit Continuing Employees for their years of service recognized by the Company Group prior to the
Effective Time with the Company Group or their respective predecessors; provided that, no credit for any service will be required that would result in
duplication of benefits and such credit shall only be given to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding

to employment, engagement or service or any right to continued employment, engagement or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be “at will” employment.
(c) With respect to any group medical plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate
following the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or
waiting period requirements under any such group health plans to the same extent waived or satisfied under any corresponding Employee Benefit Plan of
a Company Group Member in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under such group health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to
amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time under the Employee Benefit Plans maintained by a
Company Group Member.

Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties

the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing
Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing.
(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if payable) and any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(e) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and the Parent Related
Parties against the Company Related Parties for money damages in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and

Guarantor, or the Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination. Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination
Fee and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(e) will be the only monetary damages Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective
Affiliates may recover from Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related
Parties will have any further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in

Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality
Agreements and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the
Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality
Agreements and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will not limit the rights of Parent and Merger
Sub under Section 9.8(a) or relieve the Company Group from liability (1) for any intentional fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any
breaches of the Confidentiality Agreements.
(iii) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, do not constitute a
penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under
this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not timely perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the last two (2) sentences of this Section 9.8(b)(i), (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that

conditions set forth therein and herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any

conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions) and the Closing is required to occur
