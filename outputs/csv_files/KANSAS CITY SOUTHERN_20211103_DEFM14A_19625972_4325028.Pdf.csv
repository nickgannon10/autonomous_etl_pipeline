QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING",14,22
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of KCS, may have regarding the transaction and the other matters
being considered at the KCS special meeting. You are urged to carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in
this proxy statement/prospectus in their entirety because this section may not provide all the information that is important to you regarding these
matters. Please refer to the section entitled “Summary” on page 1 for a summary of important information regarding the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Additional important information is contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference
into, this proxy statement/prospectus. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, without charge, by
following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information,” on page 230.
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A:
You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because KCS has agreed to be acquired by CPRL through (1) a merger of first merger sub with
and into KCS, with KCS surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately thereafter, a merger of KCS with and
into surviving merger sub, with surviving merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL (which we refer to
as the “second surviving corporation” following the second merger). The merger agreement, which governs the terms and conditions of the
transaction, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.
Your vote is required in connection with the transaction. KCS is sending these materials to KCS stockholders to help them decide how to vote their
shares with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement, among other important matters.
Q:
What matters am I being asked to vote on?
A:
In order to complete the transaction, among other things, KCS stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement in
accordance with the DGCL (which proposal we refer to as the “KCS merger proposal”).
KCS is holding the KCS special meeting to obtain approval of the KCS merger proposal. At the KCS special meeting, KCS stockholders will also be
asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which proposal we refer to as the
“KCS compensation proposal”); and
•
a proposal to adjourn the KCS special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the KCS special
meeting to approve the KCS merger proposal or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement/prospectus is timely
provided to KCS stockholders (which proposal we refer to as the “KCS adjournment proposal”).
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The approval of the KCS merger proposal is a condition to the
obligations of the parties to complete the transaction. Neither the approval of the KCS compensation proposal nor the approval of the KCS
adjournment proposal is a condition to the obligations of the parties to complete the transaction.
Q:
When and where will the KCS special meeting take place?
A:
The KCS special meeting will be held virtually via the internet on December 10, 2021, beginning at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. The KCS special meeting
will be held solely via live audio webcast and there will not be a physical meeting location. KCS stockholders will be able to attend the KCS special
meeting online
xviiiTable of Contents
and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting https://meetnow.global/MXZ6AKV (which we refer to as the “special meeting
website”). If you choose to attend the KCS special meeting and vote your shares during the KCS special meeting, you will need the control number
located on your proxy card as described in the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting— Date, Time and Place of the KCS Special Meeting”
on page 41.
Even if you plan to attend the KCS special meeting, KCS recommends that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote
will be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the KCS special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you must register in advance to attend the special meeting. To register you must submit proof of your
proxy power (legal proxy) reflecting your holdings of our stock, along with your name and email address to Computershare. Requests for
registration must be labeled as “Legal Proxy” and be received no later than 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on December 8, 2021. You will receive a
confirmation email from Computershare of your registration. Requests for registration should be directed to Computershare at the following:
•
By Email: Forward the email from your broker, or attach an image of your legal proxy, to legalproxy@computershare.com.
Q:
Does my vote matter?
A:
Yes, your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The transaction cannot be completed unless, among other
things, the KCS merger proposal is approved by KCS stockholders.
A failure to return or submit your proxy or to vote at the KCS special meeting as provided in this proxy statement/prospectus will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the KCS merger proposal. The failure to return or submit your proxy and to attend the KCS special meeting will have
no effect on the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present) or the KCS adjournment proposal, but the failure of any shares
present or represented by proxy at the KCS special meeting to vote on the proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the KCS
compensation proposal and “AGAINST” the KCS adjournment proposal, as applicable. The KCS board unanimously recommends that you vote
“FOR” the KCS merger proposal, “FOR” the KCS compensation proposal and “FOR” the KCS adjournment proposal.
Q:
What will KCS stockholders receive for their shares if the transaction is completed?
A:
Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock of KCS, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as “KCS
common stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the first merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”) (other
than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (1) the “exchange ratio” of 2.884
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable CPRL common shares (which we refer to as the “share consideration”) and (2) $90.00 in cash, without
interest (which we refer to as the “cash consideration” and, together with the share consideration, as the “merger consideration”), and each share
of 4% noncumulative preferred stock of KCS, par value $25.00 per share (which we refer to as “KCS preferred stock”), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement), will be converted into the right to
receive $37.50 in cash, without interest (which we refer to as the “preferred merger consideration”). Each holder of KCS common stock will receive
cash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any fractional CPRL common shares that such stockholder would
otherwise receive as merger consideration in the transaction. Any cash amounts to be received by holders of KCS common stock in lieu of any
fractional CPRL common shares will be rounded down to the nearest cent.
The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of KCS common stock or CPRL common shares prior to the
effective time. The CPRL common shares issued in connection with the transaction will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (which we refer
to as the “NYSE”) and the
xix
Table of Contents
Toronto Stock Exchange (which we refer to as the “TSX”) under the symbol “CP.” Based on the number of shares of KCS common stock and CPRL
common shares outstanding on October 29, 2021, upon completion of the transaction, we expect that former holders of KCS common stock would
own approximately 28% of the outstanding common shares of CPRL, and holders of CPRL common shares (whom we refer to as “CPRL
shareholders”) immediately prior to the transaction would own approximately 72% of the outstanding common shares of CPRL. KCS common stock
and KCS preferred stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols “KSU” and “KSU-P,” respectively. We encourage you to obtain current quotes
for the CPRL common shares and the KCS common stock.
Because CPRL will issue a fixed number of CPRL common shares in exchange for each share of KCS common stock, the value of the merger
consideration that holders of KCS common stock will receive in the transaction will depend on the market price of CPRL common shares at the
effective time and will not be known at the time that KCS stockholders vote on the transaction. The market price of CPRL common shares that
holders of KCS common stock receive at the effective time could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of CPRL common shares
on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the KCS special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain current market quotations
for CPRL common shares and KCS common stock before deciding how to vote with respect to the KCS merger proposal. Based on the closing price
of CPRL common shares of $72.71 on the NYSE on August 9, 2021, the last full trading day prior to that on which CPRL submitted a revised offer to
acquire KCS, the implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock was approximately $299.70 per share of KCS common
stock. On October 29, 2021, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of CPRL common
shares on the NYSE was $77.40 per share, resulting in an implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock of $313.22 per
share of KCS common stock.
For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by KCS stockholders if the transaction is completed, see the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration” on page 139.
Q:
How does the KCS board recommend that I vote at the KCS special meeting?
A:
The KCS board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the KCS merger proposal, “FOR” the KCS compensation proposal and “FOR” the
KCS adjournment proposal.
In considering the recommendations of the KCS board, KCS stockholders should be aware that KCS directors and executive officers have interests
in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally. These interests may include the treatment of
outstanding KCS stock options, KCS restricted share awards, KCS performance share awards and KCS director deferred stock (which we
collectively refer to as “KCS equity awards”) under the merger agreement, the potential payment of severance benefits and acceleration of
outstanding KCS equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, retention awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance
coverage. For a more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—
Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction” on page 102.
Q:
If my KCS stock is represented by physical stock certificates, should I send my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the transaction is completed, you will receive a transmittal form from the exchange agent with instructions for the surrender of your KCS
stock certificates. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
Q:
Who may vote at the KCS special meeting?
A:
All holders of record of shares of KCS voting stock who held shares at the close of business on October 14, 2021 (which we refer to as the “record
date”) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the KCS special meeting. Shares held through the KCS 401(k) Plan must be voted prior to the
meeting and by
x
x
Table of Contents
9:00 a.m. Central Time on December 8, 2021. Each such holder of KCS voting stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought
before the KCS special meeting for each share of KCS voting stock that such holder owned of record as of the record date. Attendance at the KCS
special meeting is not required to vote. See below and the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting—Voting by Proxy or in Person” on page 44
for instructions on how to vote your shares without attending the KCS special meeting.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is a stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such stockholder on their behalf. The document used to
designate a proxy to vote your shares of KCS voting stock is referred to as a “proxy card.”
Q:
How many votes does each share of KCS voting stock have?
A:
Each KCS stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of KCS voting stock held of record as of the record date. As of the record date, there
were 91,194,982 outstanding shares of KCS voting stock.
Q:
How many votes must be present to hold the KCS special meeting?
A:
A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be represented, either by the appearance of the stockholder in person (including virtually)
or through representation by proxy, to hold a valid meeting.
Holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the KCS capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present via the
special meeting website or represented by proxy at the KCS special meeting in order to constitute a quorum.
If a quorum is not present, the KCS special meeting may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of KCS voting stock
required to constitute a quorum attend.
Q:
Where will the CPRL common shares that I receive in the transaction be publicly traded?
A:
The CPRL common shares to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction will be listed for trading on the NYSE and TSX under the
symbol “CP.”
Q:
What happens if the transaction is not completed?
A:
If the KCS merger proposal is not approved by KCS stockholders, or if the transaction is not completed for any other reason, KCS stockholders will
not receive the merger consideration, the preferred merger consideration or any other consideration in connection with the transaction, and their
shares of KCS stock will remain outstanding.
If the transaction is not completed, CPRL and KCS will each remain public companies independent of one another, the KCS common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol “KSU” and the KCS preferred stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE under the symbol “KSU-P.”
In the event that the transaction is completed, but STB final approval is not obtained and CPRL is not permitted to acquire control over KCS’s
railroad operations, KCS stockholders will retain the merger consideration, the preferred merger consideration and any other consideration received
in connection with the transaction, and thus will continue to hold any CPRL common shares issued in connection with the transaction.
If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, KCS may be required to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million
and/or the CN termination amount refund of $700.0 million. If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, CPRL may be
required to pay KCS a
xxi
Table of Contents
termination payment of either $700.0 million or $1.0 billion, depending on the reason for termination. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement” on page 164 for a more detailed discussion of the termination payments.
Q:
What is a “broker non-vote”?
A:
Under the NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares (i.e., shares of record held by
banks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a
particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. All of the KCS
proposals are “non-routine” matters under NYSE rules.
A “broker non-vote” occurs on an item when (1) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to
be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the
shares, and (2) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions. Because all of the KCS proposals are
non-routine matters under NYSE rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, KCS does not expect there to be any broker
non-votes at the KCS special meeting.
Q:
What stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the KCS special meeting? What will happen if I fail to vote or abstain from
voting on each proposal at the KCS special meeting?
A:
Proposal 1: KCS Merger Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS merger proposal requires the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of KCS voting stock entitled to vote on the KCS merger proposal. Accordingly, a
KCS stockholder’s abstention from voting or the failure of any KCS stockholder to vote (including the failure of a KCS stockholder who holds their
shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee to give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to
the KCS merger proposal) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the KCS merger proposal.
Proposal 2: KCS Compensation Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the advisory KCS compensation
proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person
(including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the KCS compensation proposal. Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in
person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same
effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the KCS compensation proposal. If a KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS
special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is
present).
Proposal 3: KCS Adjournment Proposal. Approval of the KCS adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the
KCS adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present). Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the
KCS special meeting abstains from voting, or responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the
KCS adjournment proposal. If a KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by
proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for such proposal.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to KCS’s named executive officers (i.e., the KCS compensation proposal)?
A:
Under SEC rules, KCS is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its stockholders with respect to the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to KCS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
xxii
Table of Contents
Q:
What happens if KCS stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS’s
named executive officers (i.e., the KCS compensation proposal)?
A:
Because the vote to approve the KCS compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the outcome of the vote will not be binding upon KCS or the
combined company, and the completion of the transaction is not conditioned or dependent upon the approval of the KCS compensation proposal.
Accordingly, the compensation that is subject to the vote, which is described in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Interests of
KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction” on page 102 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to KCS’s named executive
officers even if KCS’s stockholders do not approve the KCS compensation proposal.
Q:
How can I vote my shares at the KCS special meeting?
A:
Shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record of KCS may be voted during the KCS special meeting via the special meeting
website. If you choose to vote your shares during the virtual meeting, you will need the control number included on your proxy card in order to
access the special meeting website and to vote as described in the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting—Voting by Proxy or in Person” on
page 44.
If you hold your shares held in “street name”, you must register in advance to attend the special meeting. To register you must submit proof of
your proxy power (legal proxy) reflecting your holdings of our stock, along with your name and email address to Computershare. Requests for
registration must be labeled as “Legal Proxy” and be received no later than 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on December 8, 2021. You will receive a
confirmation email from Computershare of your registration. Requests for registration should be directed to Computershare at the following:
•
By Email: Forward the email from your broker, or attach an image of your legal proxy, to legalproxy@computershare.com.
Even if you plan to attend the KCS special meeting, KCS recommends that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote
will be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the KCS special meeting.
Additional information on attending the KCS special meeting can be found under the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting” on page 41.
Q:
How do participants in the KCS 401(k) Plan vote?
A:
If you participate in the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the “KCS 401(k) Plan”) and own shares of KCS common stock in your account, you
should have received a full set of printed proxy materials, including a voting instruction form to instruct the trustee of the KCS 401(k) Plan how to
vote the shares of KCS common stock held on your behalf. The trustee is required under the trust agreement to vote the shares in accordance with
the instructions given on the voting instruction form. Voting instructions may also be given by Internet or telephone by participants in the KCS
401(k) Plan. The voting instruction form contains the Internet address and toll-free number. If voting instructions are not received from a
participant, the trustee must vote those shares, as well as any unallocated shares, in the same proportions as the shares for which voting
instructions were received from plan participants. Voting instructions by Internet or telephone must be given by 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on
December 8, 2021. Unless you give voting instructions by Internet or telephone, the voting instruction form should be returned in the envelope
provided to Computershare. The voting instruction form should not be returned to us. KCS 401(k) Plan participants who wish to revoke their voting
instructions must contact the trustee and follow its procedures.
xxiii
Table of Contents
Q:
Are the votes of participants in the KCS 401(k) Plan confidential?
A:
Under the terms of the KCS 401(k) Plan, the trustee is required to establish procedures to ensure that the instructions received from participants are
held in confidence and not divulged, released or otherwise utilized in a manner that might influence the participants’ free exercise of their voting
rights.
Q:
How can I vote my shares without attending the KCS special meeting?
A:
Whether you hold your shares directly as the stockholder of record of KCS or beneficially in “street name,” you may direct your vote by proxy
without attending the KCS special meeting via the special meeting website. If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the
internet, or by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Please note that if you hold shares
beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Additional information on voting procedures can be found under the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting” on page 41.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name?”
A:
If your shares of KCS voting stock are registered directly in your name with Computershare, the transfer agent for KCS, you are considered the
stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote your shares directly at the KCS special
meeting. You may also grant a proxy for your vote directly to KCS or to a third party to vote your shares at the KCS special meeting.
If your shares of KCS voting stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street
name.” Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares and
you must instruct the bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote them by following the instructions that the bank, broker or other nominee
provides to you with these proxy materials. Most banks, brokers and other nominees offer the ability for stockholders to submit voting instructions
by mail by completing a voting instruction card, by telephone, and by the internet.
Q:
If my shares of KCS voting stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee
automatically vote those shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of KCS voting stock if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares.
Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of KCS voting stock in “street name” for their customers have authority to
vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are
prohibited from exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the KCS proposals. As a result, absent
specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are not empowered to vote such shares.
Since there are no items on the agenda that your broker has discretionary authority to vote upon, your shares will not be counted as present at the
KCS special meeting for the purposes of determining a quorum if you fail to instruct your broker on how to vote on the KCS proposals. If you fail
to submit any instruction to your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have no effect on the KCS compensation proposal, assuming that a quorum
is otherwise present, and it will have no effect on the KCS adjournment proposal. However, failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
on how to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the KCS merger proposal.

Table of Contents
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the KCS special meeting?
A:
If you hold shares of KCS voting stock in “street name” and also directly in your name as a stockholder of record or otherwise, or if you hold
shares of KCS voting stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the KCS special
meeting.
Record Holders. For shares held directly, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast your vote by telephone or via the internet
as provided on each proxy card) or otherwise follow the voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to ensure that all
of your shares of KCS voting stock held directly by you are voted.
Shares in “street name.” For shares held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee to make sure that you vote all of your shares held in “street name.”
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of KCS voting stock voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares of KCS voting stock in the
way that you indicate. For each item before the KCS special meeting, you may specify whether your shares of KCS voting stock should be voted
for or against, or should abstain from voting.
Q:
How will my shares of KCS voting stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?
A:
If you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of KCS voting stock to be voted, then your shares of KCS
voting stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the KCS board: “FOR” the KCS merger proposal, “FOR” the KCS
compensation proposal and “FOR” the KCS adjournment proposal.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?
A:
Any KCS stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy and change their vote before the proxy is voted at the KCS special meeting
by doing any of the following:
•
subsequently submitting a new proxy (including by submitting a proxy via the internet or telephone) for the KCS special meeting that is
received by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy card;
•
giving written notice of your revocation to KCS’s Corporate Secretary; or
•
voting at the KCS special meeting.
Execution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the KCS special meeting and vote thereat. Written notices of
revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to:
Kansas City Southern

Q:
If I hold my shares in “street name,” can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting instructions to my bank, broker or other
nominee?
A:
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you previously provided voting instructions to your bank, broker or
other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the KCS special meeting?
A:
The preliminary voting results for the KCS special meeting are expected to be announced at the KCS special meeting. In addition, within four
business days following certification of the final voting results KCS will file the final voting results of the KCS special meeting (or, if the final voting
results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Do KCS stockholders have dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
A:
Yes. If a KCS stockholder wants to exercise appraisal rights and receive the fair value of shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in
cash instead of the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, then you must file a written objection with KCS prior to
the KCS special meeting stating, among other things, that you will exercise your right to dissent if the transaction is completed. Also, you may not
vote in favor of the KCS merger proposal and must follow other procedures, both before and after the KCS special meeting, as described in Annex
D to this proxy statement/prospectus. Note that if you return a signed proxy card without voting instructions or with instructions to vote “FOR”
the KCS merger proposal, then your shares will automatically be voted in favor of the KCS merger proposal and you will lose all appraisal rights
available under Delaware law. A summary of these provisions can be found under “The Merger Agreement—Shares Subject to Properly Exercised
Appraisal Rights” on page 139. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, KCS stockholders who are
considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. Failure to strictly comply with the applicable Delaware law
provisions will result in the loss of the right of appraisal.
Q:
Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the KCS merger proposal?
A:
Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” on page 22. You also should read and
carefully consider the risk factors with respect to KCS and CPRL that are contained in the documents that are incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of KCS voting stock after the record date but before the KCS special meeting?
A:
The record date is earlier than the date of the KCS special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of KCS voting stock after the record
date but before the KCS special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the KCS special meeting.
Q:
Who is paying for the KCS special meeting and this proxy solicitation?
A:
KCS has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. (which we refer to as “MacKenzie”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the KCS special meeting.
KCS estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $175,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. KCS has
agreed to indemnify MacKenzie against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain
exceptions).
KCS also may be required to reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses
in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of KCS voting

stock. KCS’s directors, officers and employees and CPRL’s directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic
means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q:
When is CPRL’s acquisition of KCS expected to be completed?
A:
CPRL’s acquisition of control over KCS’s railroad operations will be completed in two stages. First, the transaction will occur and, following the
post-closing contributions described in this proxy statement/prospectus, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving
corporation, as successor to KCS, will be deposited by Cygnus Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
CPRL (which we refer to as “merger holdco”) into an independent, irrevocable voting trust (which we refer to as the “voting trust”) under a voting
trust agreement (which we refer to as the “voting trust agreement”) to be entered into by and among CPRL, merger holdco and the trustee, expected
to be Mr. David L. Starling (whom we refer to as the “trustee”), pending receipt of the final and non-appealable approval or exemption by the U.S.
Surface Transportation Board (which we refer to as the “STB”) of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement pursuant to 49 U.S.C. §
11323 et seq. (which we refer to as “STB final approval”).
Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions that Must
Be Satisfied or Waived for the Transaction to Occur” on page 141, including approval of the KCS merger proposal by KCS stockholders, the
transaction is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022. However, neither KCS nor CPRL can predict the actual date on which the
transaction will be completed, or if the transaction will be completed at all, because completion of the transaction is subject to conditions and
factors outside the control of both companies, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals. The merger agreement requires the
first step of CPRL’s acquisition of KCS to be completed by the end date of February 21, 2022 (provided, that to the extent the condition to obtain
the authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has
not been satisfied or waived on or prior to February 21, 2022, but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing), the end date will be automatically extended to May 21, 2022).
Following completion of the first step of CPRL’s acquisition of KCS through the transaction and pending receipt of STB final approval and
approval from other applicable regulatory authorities in order to complete the combination of CPRL and KCS, all outstanding shares of capital stock
of the second surviving corporation will be held in the voting trust. STB review of the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of
2022. If STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, the voting trust would be terminated and CPRL
(through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, merger holdco) would acquire control over KCS’s railroad operations. For more information on the
required regulatory approvals, the applicable regulatory processes and the conditions to the completion of CPRL’s acquisition of KCS, see the
section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction” on page 110.
Q:
What equity stake will KCS stockholders hold in CPRL immediately following the transaction?
A:
Based on the number of CPRL common shares and shares of KCS common stock outstanding on October 29, 2021, at the effective time, former
holders of KCS common stock are expected to own approximately 28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares, and persons who were CPRL
shareholders immediately prior to the transaction are expected to own approximately 72% of the outstanding CPRL common shares. The relative
ownership interests of CPRL shareholders and former holders of KCS common stock in CPRL immediately following the transaction will depend on
the number of CPRL common shares and shares of KCS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the transaction.

Table of Contents
Q:
If I am a holder of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, how will I receive the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration to
which I am entitled?
A:
If you hold your shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in book-entry form, whether through The Depository Trust Company or
otherwise, you will not be required to take any specific actions to exchange your shares for CPRL common shares and the cash consideration. Your
shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock will, at the effective time, be automatically exchanged for, as applicable, the CPRL common
shares and cash (including any cash in lieu of any fractional CPRL common shares) to which you are entitled. If you instead hold your shares of
KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock in certificated form, then, after receiving the proper and completed documentation from you following
the completion of the transaction, Computershare Investor Services Inc. or a bank or trust company or similar institution selected by CPRL with
KCS’s prior approval (which we refer to as the “exchange agent”) will deliver to you the CPRL common shares and cash (including any cash in lieu
of any fractional CPRL common shares) to which you are entitled as merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable. More
information may be found in the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration” and “The Merger Agreement—No Fractional
Shares” on pages 139 and 139, respectively.
Q:
Will the CPRL common shares to be issued to holders of KCS common stock at the effective time be traded on an exchange?
A:
Yes. It is a condition to the completion of the transaction that the CPRL common shares to be issued in connection with the first merger be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing conditions. All CPRL common
shares received by holders of KCS common stock in connection with the transaction will be listed on the NYSE and the TSX under the symbol
“CP” and may be traded on the exchanges by stockholders.
CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders in connection with the transaction will be freely transferable, except for CPRL
common shares issued to any stockholder deemed to be an “affiliate” of CPRL for purposes of United States (which we refer to as the “U.S.”)
federal securities law. CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders in connection with the transaction will not be legended and
may be resold in Canada through registered dealers provided that (i) the trade is not a “control distribution” as defined in National Instrument 45-
102—Resale of Securities of the Canadian securities administrators, (ii) no unusual effort is made to prepare the market or to create a demand for the
CPRL common shares, (iii) no extraordinary commission or consideration is paid to a person in respect of such sale, and (iv) if the selling security
holder is an insider or officer of CPRL, as the case may be, the selling security holder has no reasonable grounds to believe that CPRL is in default
of applicable Canadian securities law. For more information, see the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Restrictions on Resales of CPRL
Common Shares Received in the Transaction” on page 119.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction?
A:
CPRL and KCS intend that the transaction will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”) and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not apply to cause the transaction to result in gain
recognition by holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any such
holder of KCS common stock who would be treated as a “five-percent transferee shareholder” (within the meaning of Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) of
the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, which we refer to as the “Treasury Regulations”) of CPRL following the transaction who
does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 or does not comply with
the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the recognition of gain, which we refer to as an
“excepted shareholder”). The obligation of KCS to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz, special counsel to KCS, or another nationally recognized tax
xxviii
Table of Contents
counsel, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will
qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the transaction will not result in gain recognition under
Section 367(a)(1) of the Code by holders of KCS common stock (other than any excepted shareholder).
Accordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction will qualify as a reorganization and that Section 367(a) does not apply to require gain
recognition, a U.S. holder (other than an excepted shareholder) that exchanges shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration in the
transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the cash consideration (excluding cash received in
lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the cash
consideration (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the share consideration
(including any fractional CPRL common shares deemed received) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of KCS common stock in
the transaction, over (b) such U.S. holder’s tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock exchanged. In addition, a U.S. holder of KCS common
stock generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares.
The exchange of KCS preferred stock for cash pursuant to the transaction generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. U.S. holders of KCS preferred stock will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
of cash received with respect to their shares of KCS preferred stock pursuant to the transaction and their adjusted tax basis in such shares.
For the definition of “U.S. holder” and a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S.
holders, see the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” on page 120.
The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all KCS stockholders. The tax consequences to KCS stockholders will
depend on their individual situations. Accordingly, all KCS stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the
particular tax consequences of the transaction to them.
Q:
What are the material Canadian federal income tax consequences of the transaction?
A:
A Canadian resident holder (as defined in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax
Consequences,” on page 125) who disposes of their KCS common stock for CPRL common shares and cash consideration (including cash received
in lieu of a fractional CPRL common share) in connection with the first merger will generally realize a capital gain (or capital loss) for Canadian
federal income tax purposes equal to the amount by which the sum of the aggregate of the fair market value of the CPRL common shares and cash
consideration received exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the Canadian resident holder’s KCS common stock determined
immediately before the disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition.
A Canadian resident holder who disposes of their KCS preferred stock for cash consideration in connection with the first merger will generally
realize a capital gain (or capital loss) for Canadian federal income tax purposes equal to the amount by which the cash consideration received
exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the Canadian resident holder’s KCS preferred stock determined immediately before the
disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition.
A non-Canadian resident holder (as defined in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax
Consequences,” on page 125) will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common
stock or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, in connection with the first merger, or on a subsequent disposition of a CPRL common share
acquired as result of the first merger, as applicable, unless the relevant share is “taxable Canadian property,” and is not “treaty-protected property”
(as those terms are defined in the Canadian tax act) of the non-Canadian resident holder, at the time of the disposition.

For more information, see the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences,” on page 125.
Q:
Is the exchange ratio subject to adjustment based on changes in the prices of KCS common stock or CPRL common shares? Can it be adjusted
for any other reason?
A:
For the share consideration portion of the merger consideration, for each share of KCS common stock, you will receive a fixed number of CPRL
common shares equal to the exchange ratio of 2.884, not a number of shares that will be determined based on a fixed market value. The market value
of CPRL common shares and the market value of KCS common stock at the effective time may vary significantly from their respective values on the
date that the merger agreement was executed or at other dates, such as the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the KCS special
meeting. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in CPRL’s or KCS’s respective businesses, operations or
prospects, regulatory considerations, and general business, market, industry or economic conditions. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to
reflect any changes in the market value of CPRL common shares or the market value of KCS common stock. Therefore, the aggregate market value
of the CPRL common shares that you are entitled to receive at the effective time could vary significantly from the value of such shares on the date
of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the KCS special meeting. See the risk factor entitled “Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the
market price of shares of CPRL common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, KCS stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the
merger consideration they will receive in the transaction prior to the closing of the transaction,” on page 22.
However, the merger consideration will be equitably adjusted to provide you and CPRL with the same economic effect as contemplated by the
merger agreement in the event of any further reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger or other similar transaction involving KCS common stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time.
Q:

Kansas City, MO 64105

KCS, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with domestic and international rail operations in North America that are strategically focused
on the growing north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and industrial markets in the central U.S. with major industrial cities in
Mexico. As used below, “Kansas City Southern” may refer to KCS or, as the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of KCS.
Kansas City Southern controls and owns all of the stock of The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (which we refer to as “KCSR”), a U.S.
Class 1 railroad founded in 1887. KCSR serves a ten-state region in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. and has the shortest north/south
rail route between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
Kansas City Southern controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (which we refer to as “KCSM”). Through
its 50-year concession from the Mexican government (which we refer to as the “concession”), which could expire in 2047 unless extended, KCSM
operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic portion of the shortest, most direct rail
passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal international gateway through which a substantial portion of rail and
truck traffic between the U.S. and Mexico crosses the border. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and three of its major
seaports. KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the U.S. and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Under the
concession, KCSM has the right to use and operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River between
the U.S. and Mexico. KCS owns the northern half of this bridge through its ownership of Mexrail, Inc. (which we refer to as “Mexrail”).

Table of Contents
KCSM also provides exclusive rail access to the port of Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government developed the port at
Lazaro Cardenas principally to serve Mexican markets and as an alternative to the U.S. west coast ports for Asian and South American traffic bound
for North America.
Kansas City Southern wholly owns Mexrail which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company (which we refer to as “Tex-Mex”). Tex-
Mex owns a 160-mile rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR with
KCSM.
The Kansas City Southern coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex, including trackage rights) comprises approximately 7,100 route
miles extending from the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. south into Mexico and connects with all other Class 1 railroads, providing
shippers with an effective alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the Southeast and Southwest U.S. through
alternate interchange hubs.
Panama Canal Railway Company (which we refer to as “PCRC”), an unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by Kansas City Southern
and Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (which we refer to as “Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the
Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international container shipping companies with a
railway transportation alternative to the Panama Canal. The concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of 25 years with an automatic renewal
for an additional 25-year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south railroad traversing the isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans.
Other subsidiaries and affiliates of Kansas City Southern include the following:
•
Meridian Speedway, LLC, a 70% owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and
Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway.”
Norfolk Southern Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns the
remaining 30% of MSLLC;
•
TFCM, S. de R.L. de C.V., a 45% owned unconsolidated affiliate that operates a bulk liquid terminal in San Luis Potosí, Mexico;
•
Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V., a 25% owned unconsolidated affiliate that provides railroad services as well as
ancillary services in the greater Mexico City area; and
•
PTC-220, LLC, a 14% owned unconsolidated affiliate that holds the licenses to large blocks of radio spectrum and other assets for
positive train control.
KCS is a public company. KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols “KSU” and “KSU-P,” respectively.
KCS’s principal executive offices are located at 427 West 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64105, and its telephone number is 1-816-983-1303.

The merger agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
therein, (i) at the effective time, first merger sub will merge with and into KCS, with KCS surviving the first merger as a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (ii) immediately following the first merger at the effective time of the second merger (which we refer to as the
“second effective time”), KCS will merge with and into surviving merger sub, with surviving merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct,
wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL.
Immediately following the second merger and immediately prior to the deposit of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second
surviving corporation into the independent, irrevocable voting trust (which we refer to as the “voting trust transaction”), CPRL and certain
subsidiaries of CPRL will be involved in an internal reorganization that will result in the second surviving corporation becoming an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of CPRL. See the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Transaction Structure,” on page 48 for a description of each step
involved in the internal reorganization.
The terms and conditions of the transaction are contained in the merger agreement, which is described in this proxy statement/prospectus and
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully, as it is the legal document that
governs the transaction. All descriptions in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus of the terms and conditions of the

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of KCS common stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted
automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration, being the share consideration of 2.884 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
CPRL common shares and the cash consideration of $90.00 in cash, without interest, and each share of KCS preferred stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to
receive the preferred merger consideration of $37.50 in cash, without interest.
The merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration will be equitably adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares involving KCS common stock,
KCS preferred stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time, to proportionally reflect such change.

Certain activities of CPRL, KCS and their subsidiaries are regulated by the STB. STB approval or exemption is required for, among other things,
CPRL’s or merger holdco’s acquisition of control of KCS. Upon consummation of the transaction, merger holdco will establish the voting trust.
Following the transaction and pending STB final approval or exemption of the transaction pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 11323 et seq., all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation will be deposited by merger holdco into the voting trust in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the voting trust agreement. The trustee will agree to act as voting trustee in respect of the voting trust; in such capacity,
the trustee will vote all shares of the capital stock of the second surviving corporation at any time delivered to the trustee of the voting trust
pursuant to the voting trust agreement (which shares we refer to as “trust stock”). Although merger holdco will remain the beneficial owner of the
trust stock, both it and CPRL will be unable to exercise control over KCS while the trust stock is held by the trustee. The deposit of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation into the voting trust by merger holdco will insulate the second surviving corporation
from control by CPRL or merger holdco until STB final approval has been either obtained (or is otherwise no longer required by law) or denied. The
management and board of directors of KCS will continue to manage the second surviving corporation while its outstanding shares of capital stock
are held in the voting trust, pursuing its independent business plan and growth strategies. For a summary of the terms of the voting trust, see the

Opinion of Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (which we refer to as “Morgan Stanley”) was retained by the KCS board to act as its financial advisor in connection with
the transaction. On September 15, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
September 15, 2021, to the KCS board to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion,
the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock, other than shares held in treasury or held by CPRL, the
merger subs or KCS (in each case, other than shares held on behalf of third parties) or shares with respect to which the holders thereof have not
voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect
thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, “excluded shares”), under the merger agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to such holders of KCS common stock.
The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion to the KCS board, dated September 15, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

opinion was for the benefit of the KCS board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement as of
the date of the opinion and did not address any other aspects or implications of the transaction. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and
does not, constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of KCS or CPRL should vote at the shareholders’ meetings to be

Opinion of BofA Securities
On September 15, 2021, at a meeting of the KCS board held to evaluate the transaction, BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”), KCS’s financial

that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in BofA Securities’ written opinion,
the merger consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders.

Date, Time and Place of the KCS Special Meeting
The KCS special meeting will be held virtually via the internet on December 10, 2021 at 9:00 a.m, Central Time. In light of ongoing developments
related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, KCS has elected to hold the KCS special meeting solely by means of remote communication via the
internet. The KCS special meeting will be held solely via live audio webcast and there will not be a physical meeting location. KCS stockholders will
be able to attend the KCS special meeting online and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting the special meeting website at
https://meetnow.global/MXZ6AKV.
Record Date and Outstanding Shares of KCS Voting Stock
Only holders of record of shares of KCS voting stock outstanding as of the close of business on October 14, 2021, the record date for the KCS
special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the KCS special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the KCS special meeting.
KCS stockholders may cast one vote for each share of KCS voting stock that KCS stockholders own of record as of that record date.
Quorum
A quorum of KCS stockholders is necessary to transact business at the KCS special meeting. A quorum will exist at the KCS special meeting if
holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the KCS capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote are present in person
(including virtually) or represented by proxy. All shares of KCS voting stock represented by a valid proxy and all abstentions will be counted as
present for purposes of establishing a quorum. All of the KCS proposals are considered “non-routine” matters under the NYSE rules, and, therefore,
brokers are not permitted to vote on any of the matters to be considered at the KCS special meeting unless they have received instructions from the
beneficial owners. As a result, no “broker non-votes” are expected at the meeting, and shares held in “street name” will not be counted as present
for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the beneficial owner provides their bank, broker or other nominee with voting
instructions for at least one of the proposals brought before the KCS special meeting.
Required Vote to Approve the KCS Merger Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of KCS voting stock entitled to vote on the KCS merger proposal. Accordingly, a KCS stockholder’s abstention from voting
or the failure of any KCS stockholder to vote (including the failure of a KCS stockholder who holds their shares in “street name” through a bank,
broker or other nominee to give voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the KCS merger proposal) will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the KCS merger proposal.
Required Vote to Approve the KCS Compensation Proposal
Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the KCS compensation proposal. Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting
abstains
7Table of Contents
from voting, or responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the KCS compensation proposal. If
a KCS stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on
the vote count for the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
Required Vote to Approve the KCS Adjournment Proposal
Approval of the KCS adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS
special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the KCS adjournment proposal (whether or not a
quorum is present). Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting abstains from voting, or
responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the KCS adjournment proposal. If a KCS
stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the
vote count for such proposal.
Voting by Directors and Executive Officers
As of the record date, KCS directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote approximately 0.44% of
the total outstanding shares of KCS common stock and 0.0% of the total outstanding shares of KCS preferred stock. Although no KCS director or
executive officer has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so, KCS currently expects that all of its directors and executive officers will
vote their shares “FOR” the KCS merger proposal, “FOR” the KCS compensation proposal and “FOR” the KCS adjournment proposal. See the
section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction” on page 102 and the
arrangements described in Part III of KCS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, KCS’s Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 and KCS’s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule

Under Section 611(c) of the TSX Company Manual, security holder approval is required if the number of securities issued or issuable by a listed
issuer in payment of the purchase price for an acquisition, exceeds 25% of the number of securities of the listed issuer which are outstanding, on a
pre-acquisition, non-diluted basis. Under the terms of the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to issue 2.884 CPRL common shares and $90.00 in
cash, without interest, in exchange for each share of KCS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Issuances
by KCS of shares of KCS common stock are restricted under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain limited exceptions or the prior
written consent of CPRL. As a result, the actual number of CPRL common shares that will be issued at the effective time will depend on the number
of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.
CPRL shareholders will be required to approve the issuance of such number of CPRL common shares as is necessary under the merger agreement to
issue the share consideration. As described in the TSX listing application filed by CPRL, based on the number of shares of KCS common stock
outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL anticipates up to 277,960,197 CPRL common shares to be issuable to KCS common stockholders under
the terms of the merger agreement, which represents approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding CPRL common shares as of September 9, 2021
(which we refer to as the “CPRL common share issuance”). Accordingly, the TSX requires that the share issuance resolution be approved by an
ordinary resolution of CPRL
8Table of Contents
shareholders (i.e., a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding CPRL common shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote at the CPRL special meeting). Despite the fact that CPRL shareholders are being asked to approve the issuance of up to 277,960,197 CPRL
common shares, based on the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL expects that it would issue (at the
direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 264,723,997 CPRL common shares in the first merger
and is seeking CPRL shareholder approval for the issuance of up to 13,236,200 additional CPRL common shares to accommodate the effects of
rounding and for other administrative purposes in accordance with the policies of the TSX.
The actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the merger agreement will be determined immediately prior to
the effective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding at such time and the number of KCS
restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.
CPRL will be holding the special meeting of CPRL shareholders on December 8, 2021 (which we refer to, including any adjournments or
postponements thereof, as the “CPRL special meeting”) to vote on the resolutions necessary to complete the transaction and other matters to be
considered by the CPRL shareholders at such special meeting. In addition to the above-mentioned resolution approving the CPRL common share
issuance, at the CPRL special meeting, CPRL shareholders entitled to vote at the CPRL special meeting will be asked to approve a special resolution
authorizing and approving an amendment to the articles of CPRL to change its name to “Canadian Pacific Kansas City,” which amendment is
conditional upon completion of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval. CPRL will separately prepare the
management information circular in accordance with applicable Canadian securities and corporate laws and distribute such management information
circular to its shareholders in connection with the CPRL special meeting.

The completion of the transaction is conditional upon the approval for listing of CPRL common shares issuable under the merger agreement on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing conditions, prior to the effective time.
The TSX has conditionally approved the listing of the CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders under the merger agreement,
which CPRL common shares will be registered in the U.S. pursuant to the Form F-4. Listing of such CPRL common shares is subject to CPRL fulfilling
all of the requirements of the TSX on or before the business day following the closing date. CPRL is required under the terms of the merger
agreement to apply to the NYSE to list the CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders under the merger agreement on the
NYSE, which CPRL common shares will be registered in the U.S. pursuant to the Form F-4. Listing will be subject to CPRL fulfilling all the listing
requirements of the NYSE. There can be no assurance that the CPRL common shares will be accepted for listing on the TSX or the NYSE.",43,43

If the transaction is completed, KCS common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the U.S. Exchange Act, and KCS will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to KCS common stock.
KCS has agreed to cooperate with CPRL and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and rules and policies of the NYSE and the SEC to delist the KCS common stock from the NYSE and to terminate its

As of September 30, 2021, CP had total long-term debt of approximately C$10.0 billion (U.S.$7.8 billion converted at the Bank of Canada exchange rate
on September 30, 2021) and KCS had total long-term debt of approximately U.S.$3.8 billion.
Under the Commitment Letter, dated as of September 15, 2021, by and among Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (which we refer to as “GS
Lending”), the Bank of Montreal (which we refer to as “BMO”), CPRL and CPRC, as modified by that certain joinder letter, dated September 29, 2021
(which we refer to as the “commitment letter”), BMO, GS Lending and the other financial institutions party to the commitment letter have committed
to provide an unsecured 364-day bridge facility (the “bridge facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$8.5 billion to bridge the debt
financing required to fund a portion of the cash consideration and preferred merger consideration, and transaction fees and expenses associated
with, the transaction. CPRL expects to reduce the commitments under the bridge facility with an offering of debt securities before the closing of the
transaction into the voting trust.
Effective as of April 9, 2021, CPRL amended its existing revolving credit facility to modify certain provisions relating to the calculation of the
financial covenant ratio in its credit facility. In addition, effective as of September 24, 2021, CPRL entered into an amendment to extend the two-year
tranche and the five-year tranche of its existing revolving credit facility to September 27, 2023 and September 27, 2026, respectively. Effective as of
September 29, 2021, CPRL entered into a further amendment to its existing revolving credit facility in order to provide financial covenant flexibility for
the anticipated acquisition financing pertaining to the transaction, which is in place for a two-year period from the date the transaction closes.
In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of September 15, 2021, by and among CPRL and CPRC, BMO, the other lenders and financial
institutions party thereto and BMO, as administrative agent, CPRC borrowed the aggregate amount of U.S.$500 million in unsecured term loans,
which have an initial six-month maturity. Borrowings under such credit facility, together with commercial paper issuance and cash on hand were used
to enable CPRL to make certain remittances in connection with the payments made by KCS in connection with the termination of the CN agreement.
Effective September 30, 2021, KCS obtained consent from the lenders under its existing revolving credit facility to permit closing into the voting trust
and to provide a limited waiver for a period of time after CPRL acquires control of KCS following receipt of STB final approval.",44,44

CPRL and KCS intend that the transaction will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)
(1) of the Code will not apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition by holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of
KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any excepted shareholder). The obligation of KCS to complete the transaction is
conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, special counsel to KCS, or another nationally recognized tax
counsel, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will qualify
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the transaction will not result in gain recognition under Section
367(a)(1) of the Code by holders of KCS common stock (other than any excepted shareholder).
Accordingly, on the basis of such opinion that the transaction will qualify as a reorganization and that Section 367(a) does not apply to require gain
recognition, a U.S. holder (other than an excepted shareholder) that exchanges shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration in the
transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the cash consideration (excluding cash received in lieu
10Table of Contents
of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the cash
consideration (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the share consideration
(including any fractional CPRL common shares deemed received) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of KCS common stock in
the transaction, over (b) such U.S. holder’s tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock exchanged. In addition, a U.S. holder of KCS common stock
generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares.
The exchange of KCS preferred stock for cash pursuant to the transaction generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. U.S. holders of KCS preferred stock will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
of cash received with respect to their shares of KCS preferred stock pursuant to the transaction and their adjusted tax basis in such shares.
For the definition of “U.S. holder” and a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S.
holders, see the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” on page 120.
The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all KCS stockholders. The tax consequences to KCS stockholders will
depend on their individual situations. Accordingly, all KCS stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the
particular tax consequences of the transaction to them.

purposes equal to the amount by which the sum of the aggregate of the fair market value of the CPRL common shares and cash consideration
received exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the Canadian resident holder’s KCS common stock determined immediately before the
disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition.

A non-Canadian resident holder (as defined in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax

stock or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, in connection with the first merger, or on a subsequent disposition of a CPRL common share
acquired as a result of the first merger, as applicable, unless the relevant share is “taxable Canadian property,” and is not “treaty-protected property”

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), CP will account for the transaction using the acquisition
method of accounting for business combinations.
Upon the closing, and only for the period that the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to KCS) are
held in the voting trust, CPRL will account for its indirect 100% equity ownership of the second surviving corporation using the equity method of
accounting. Once the STB has completed its review of the transaction and approved CPRL’s acquisition of control of KCS, CPRL will consolidate
KCS prospectively, and the equity method investment will be remeasured to fair value immediately before the consolidation occurs, with the
resulting gain or loss recognized in net income. As the ultimate outcome of the transaction, assuming receipt of STB final approval, will be a
business combination, the unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements presented in this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared on a

STB
The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to review by the STB pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11323 et seq., which prohibits the
acquisition of control of two or more U.S. rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the STB by a person that is not a carrier and the acquisition or
control of a U.S. rail carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers. STB approval or exemption is required for,
among other things, CPRL’s acquisition of control of KCS.
12Table of Contents
On April 23, 2021, the STB issued a decision finding that the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b) applies to the CP/KCS transaction, and that
the transaction will therefore be subject to the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. part 1180 (2000) rather than the 2001 version of those rules. Under the
pre-2001 rules that govern the transaction, no formal STB approval is required for use of a voting trust. In March 2021, the parties agreed to seek,
and sought, a written informal advisory opinion of the STB Staff to the effect that the proposed deposit of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
the second surviving corporation into the independent, irrevocable voting trust immediately following the completion of the post-closing
contributions, subject to the voting trust agreement, would preclude unlawful control of KCS by CPRL and its affiliates and would not result in a
violation of 49 U.S.C. 11323 (which we refer to as the “STB voting trust opinion”).
On May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust submitted to the STB Staff in March 2021
and granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust agreement be
modified to prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CP made the requisite
modification. The voting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in response to the STB’s May 6
decision.
On September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing
for CPRL’s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021, and that CPRL
intended to indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to
that reviewed and approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.
On September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the
“same transaction” that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB’s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL’s proposed use of a voting trust to
acquire KCS applies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.
On October 29, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed their application seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS and its U.S. rail carrier subsidiaries.
Under the merger agreement, CPRL and KCS must use reasonable best efforts to prosecute all filings and other presentations made, and promptly
make any subsequent filings or presentations, with the STB with diligence, diligently oppose any third party’s objections to, appeals from or
petitions to reconsider or reopen any approval, opinion, exemption or other authorization obtained from the STB, and take all such further action as
in the reasonable judgment of CPRL and KCS may facilitate obtaining STB final approval.
CFIUS
The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which
we refer to as “CFIUS”) pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(which we refer to as “Section 721”). Under the terms of the merger agreement, CPRL may not assume control over KCS’s railroad operations until:
(a) CFIUS has determined that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and the parties have received written notice from CFIUS that action under Section 721 has been concluded; (b) the parties have received
written notice from CFIUS that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not “covered transactions” pursuant to Section 721; or
(c) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the U.S. requesting the decision of the President of the U.S. with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and (i) the period under Section 721 during which the President of the U.S. may announce his decision to
take action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has expired without any such
action being threatened, announced or taken or (ii) the President of the U.S. has announced a decision not to, or otherwise declined to, take any
action to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we collectively refer to as “completion of the CFIUS
Process”).

COFECE and the IFT
Pursuant to the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law, consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement requires the approval of the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (the Mexican
Antitrust Commission) (which we refer to as “COFECE”) and the Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (the Mexican Federal
Telecommunications Institute) (which we refer to as the “IFT,” and, together with COFECE, the “Mexican antitrust authorities”), autonomous

than 30 business days after the date of the merger agreement, file any and all notifications and report forms to the Mexican antitrust authorities, in
each case as required under applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the process under applicable law as soon as practicable after the date of the merger agreement
(i.e., September 15, 2021).
Notifications of the transaction were submitted to the IFT on October 4, 2021 and to COFECE on October 5, 2021. The Mexican antitrust authorities
will each have 60 business days to review the transaction and issue a resolution (as such period is calculated and may be extended under Mexican
law, as described in the Section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,” on page 110). If the
Mexican antitrust authorities do not issue a resolution within the relevant review period (including any extension, if applicable), the transaction will
be deemed approved. Failure to obtain clearance from the Mexican antitrust authorities precludes the parties from closing the transaction in Mexico.
ARTF and SCT
KCS and CPRL (through KCSM) have filed notices with the Mexican Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario (the Regulatory Agency of Rail
Transportation of Mexico) (which we refer to as “ARTF”) and the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (the Secretary of Communications
and Transportation of Mexico) (which we refer to as “SCT”), which are responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, prior to the effective
time. The notice process is for informational purposes only, and no approval is required from either ARTF or SCT to consummate the transaction.
Mexican Rail Union
KCS has provided an informal notification to the Mexican rail union; no approval on the part of the Mexican rail union is required in order to
consummate the transaction.
FCC
KCS is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (which we refer to as the “FCC”) under the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended. FCC approval of the transfer of KCS’s FCC licenses will
14
Table of Contents
be required. Failure to receive FCC approval prior to transferring control of the FCC licenses could result in civil fines, revocation of the subject
licenses, and/or other remedial actions by the FCC. Initial approval from the FCC is expected before closing into the voting trust.
In October 2021, CPRL and KCS filed the required applications for FCC consent to the transfer of control of the subject licenses held by KCS from
KCS to the voting trust. In November 2021, CPRL and KCS anticipate that applications to transfer control of KCS as lessee or sublessee of certain
FCC licenses will be filed. While CPRL and KCS believe that FCC approval will ultimately be obtained, this approval is not assured.
Additionally, if the transaction is consummated, then the FCC will also preside over a similar post-closing approval process. CPRL and KCS
anticipate, but cannot guarantee, that the FCC will ultimately approve this post-closing transfer of control of the FCC licenses. CPRL and KCS are
not aware of any cases where FCC approval did not follow STB approval.

If the transaction is completed, KCS stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise comply with
the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder and obtain payment in cash for the fair
value of their shares of KCS, subject to certain limitations under the DGCL. Any shares of KCS voting stock that are held by a KCS stockholder on
the date of making an appraisal demand, who continues to own such shares through the effective time, who has not voted in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL will not be converted into the right
to receive the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, and a KCS stockholder who holds such shares will have the
right to obtain payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of KCS in lieu of the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as
applicable, unless such KCS stockholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such stockholder’s appraisal rights under
the DGCL. If, after the effective time, such holder of KCS voting stock fails to perfect, effectively withdraws, waives or otherwise loses his, her or its
appraisal rights, each such share will be treated as if it had been converted as of the effective time into a right to receive the merger consideration or
preferred merger consideration, as applicable, without any interest thereon. Due to the complexity of the procedures for exercising your appraisal
rights, KCS stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. Failure to strictly comply
with these provisions will result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Appraisal or Dissenters’

The merger agreement generally restricts the ability of CPRL, KCS and their respective subsidiaries, directors and officers to: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry regarding, or the making or submission of any proposal, offer or indication of intent that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an alternative proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person regarding an alternative proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected
to lead to, or result in, an alternative proposal (except to notify such person that the provisions of the merger agreement prohibit any such
discussions or negotiations), (iii) furnish any nonpublic information relating to such party or its subsidiaries in connection with or for the purpose of
facilitating an alternative proposal or any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of intent that would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
alternative proposal, (iv) recommend or enter into any other letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, option

alternative proposal, or (v) approve, authorize or agree to do any of the actions outlined in clauses (i)-(iv) above or otherwise knowingly facilitate
any effort or attempt to make an alternative proposal.
However, prior to the time, but not after, in the case of KCS, the KCS stockholder approval is obtained or, in the case of CPRL, the CPRL shareholder
approval is obtained, if such party receives a superior proposal or the relevant party’s board of directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors that such proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, such party
may take various actions, including providing information in response to a request therefor (including non-public information) to the third party who
made such alternative proposal (including its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other
representatives, which we collectively refer to as “representatives,” and prospective equity and debt financing sources) (subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement) and engaging or participating in discussions or negotiations with any such third party (including its
representatives) regarding such alternative proposal.
CPRL and KCS are each required to promptly give notice to the other party if it or any of its representatives receives (i) any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an alternative proposal or (ii) any request for information that, to the knowledge of such party, has been or is reasonably likely
to have been made in connection with any alternative proposal. CPRL or KCS, as applicable, will be required to thereafter keep the other party
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material developments regarding any alternative proposal or any material change to the
terms of any such alternative proposal and any material change to the status of any such discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.

You should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information set forth in and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, before making a decision on the KCS merger proposal, the KCS compensation proposal and the KCS adjournment proposal. As
CPRL shareholders following the effective time, holders of KCS common stock will be subject to all risks inherent in the business of CPRL in addition
to the risks relating to KCS. The market value of CPRL common shares will reflect the performance of the business relative to, among other things, that
of the competitors of CPRL and KCS and general economic, market and industry conditions. The value of your investment may increase or may decline
and could result in a loss.
In addition, KCS’s and CPRL’s respective businesses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described,
in the case of KCS, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, and in the case of CPRL, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Risks Relating to the Transaction",56,56
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,Risks Relating to the Transaction,"Risks Relating to the Transaction
Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of CPRL common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, KCS
stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the transaction prior to the closing of the transaction.
At the effective time, each share of KCS common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as
described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 2.884 CPRL common shares and $90.00 in cash, without interest. Because the
exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the share consideration will depend on the market price of CPRL common shares at the effective time. The market price
of CPRL common shares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the transaction and is expected to continue to fluctuate from the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus until the closing date, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Changes in the price of
CPRL common shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in CPRL’s and
KCS’s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood
that the proposed acquisition will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the proposed acquisition and changes with respect to
expectations regarding the timing of the proposed acquisition and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond KCS’s and CPRL’s
control.
The CPRL common shares to be received by holders of KCS common stock at the effective time will have different rights from shares of KCS common
stock.
At the effective time, holders of KCS common stock will no longer be stockholders of KCS but will instead become shareholders of CPRL. The rights of
former holders of KCS common stock as stockholders will then be governed by Canadian law and by the terms of CPRL’s articles of incorporation and by-
laws, which are in some respects materially different than the terms of KCS’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which currently govern the rights of
KCS stockholders. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparison of Rights of CPRL Shareholders and KCS Stockholders,”
on page 195 for a discussion of the different rights associated with CPRL common shares and KCS common stock.
The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder/shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties,
and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.
Closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions specified in the merger agreement, and it is possible that such
conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely
22Table of Contents
affect the completion of the transaction. These conditions include, among other things: (1) receipt of the KCS stockholder approval; (2) receipt of the
CPRL shareholder approval; (3) effectiveness of the Form F-4 (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) in accordance with the provisions
of the U.S. Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form F-4 having been issued and remaining in effect and no proceeding
to that effect having been commenced; (4) the absence of any injunction or similar order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transaction
or the voting trust transaction; (5) approval by COFECE and the IFT of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (6) the CPRL common
shares issuable in the first merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary
listing requirements; (7) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the merger
agreement; (8) compliance by each party in all material respects with such party’s obligations under the merger agreement; and (9) with respect to CPRL,
the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to KCS, the absence of a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as such terms are defined
in the merger agreement).
The governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may
take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These governmental
authorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the transaction. As a condition to authorization of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the
conduct of CPRL’s business after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval.
We cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or
waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we cannot
provide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the transaction. Many of
the conditions to completion of the transaction are not within either KCS’s or CPRL’s control, and neither company can predict when or if these
conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the transaction could cause KCS and/or CPRL not to realize some or all of
the benefits that each expects to achieve if the transaction is successfully completed within the expected timeframe.
In order to complete the transaction, CPRL and KCS must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are
granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the transaction may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented and the
anticipated benefits of the transaction could be reduced.
No assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the completion of the
transaction will be satisfied. Even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as
to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents, orders and approvals may impose conditions
on or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations or assets of KCS and CPRL or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place
restrictions on the conduct of KCS’s or CPRL’s business, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended period of time to be obtained,
such extended period of time could increase the chance that an adverse event occurs with respect to KCS or CPRL. Such extended period of time also
may increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to KCS or CPRL could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Even if all necessary
approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals. For more information, see the sections
entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction” and “The Merger Agreement—Conditions that Must be
Satisfied or Waived for the Transaction to Occur,” on pages 110 and 141, respectively.
The KCS special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if
any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the KCS merger
23

proposal is approved by KCS stockholders, KCS may not be required to seek further approval of KCS stockholders.
After CPRL’s combination with KCS following receipt of STB approval, CPRL may fail to realize projected benefits and cost savings of the
combination, which could adversely affect the value of CPRL common shares.
CPRL and KCS have operated and, until the receipt of STB final approval, will continue to operate (even while the voting trust is in effect), independently.
The success of CPRL’s combination with KCS will depend, in part, on CPRL’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining the
businesses of KCS and CPRL following the (which we refer to as the “control date”), including operational and other synergies that we believe the
combined company will achieve. The anticipated benefits and synergies of CPRL’s combination with KCS may not be realized fully or at all, may take
longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as
the achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized. The integration process may, for KCS and CPRL, result in the loss of key employees, the
disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and
unforeseen expenses associated with the transaction that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain aspects of
the operations and personnel of CPRL with KCS after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval will involve complex
operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which may be made more difficult in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the
integration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may disrupt the business of the combined company.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction could adversely affect each of KCS’s and CPRL’s business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding KCS’s and CPRL’s business,
including affecting KCS’s and CPRL’s relationships with its existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect
on KCS’s or CPRL’s business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In particular, KCS and
CPRL could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the
transaction. KCS and CPRL could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased.
The attention of KCS’s and CPRL’s respective management may be directed towards closing the transaction, including obtaining regulatory approvals
and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of KCS and CPRL and matters related to the
transaction may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been
beneficial to KCS and CPRL. Additionally, the merger agreement requires each party to obtain the other party’s consent prior to taking certain specified
actions while the transaction is pending. These restrictions may prevent CPRL and KCS from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities prior
to the closing of the transaction, and in some cases for KCS, completion of the combination. Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses
of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of CPRL and the market value of CPRL common shares.
If the transaction does not close, the prices of KCS common stock and CPRL common shares may fall to the extent that the current prices of KCS common
stock and CPRL common shares reflect a market assumption that the transaction will close. In addition, the failure to close the transaction may result in
negative publicity or a negative impression of KCS in the investment community and may affect KCS’s and CPRL’s relationship with employees,
customers, suppliers and other partners in the business community.
KCS and CPRL will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction.
KCS and CPRL have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals
24
Table of Contents
and, in the case of KCS, compensation payments to its executives triggered by the change in control of KCS as a result of the transaction. KCS and CPRL
have incurred significant financial services, accounting, tax and legal fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the
transaction. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating and combining the businesses of KCS and CPRL
following receipt of STB final approval. Even if the transaction does not close, KCS and CPRL will need to pay certain costs relating to the transaction
incurred prior to the date the transaction was abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing and printing fees. Such costs may be
significant and could have an adverse effect on the parties’ future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to its own fees
and expenses, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, KCS will be required to pay to CPRL a $700.0 million termination
payment and/or the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the merger agreement is terminated under
specified circumstances, CPRL may be required to pay either $700.0 million or $1.0 billion to KCS, depending on the reason for the termination. For more
information, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,” on page 164.
Significant demands will be placed on CPRL and KCS as a result of the combination of the two companies.
As a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, significant demands will be placed on the managerial, operational
and financial personnel and systems of CPRL and KCS. CPRL and KCS cannot assure you that their respective systems, procedures and controls will be
adequate to support the expansion of operations following and resulting from the combination of the two companies. The future operating results of the
combined company will be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and
expand its operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response to the transaction.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of KCS and CPRL is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be
indicative of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company following the combination of CPRL and KCS following
receipt of STB final approval.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared using the
consolidated historical financial statements of CPRL and KCS, is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an
indication of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB
final approval. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is based in
part on certain assumptions regarding the transaction. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined
company’s results of operations or financial condition following the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval. Accordingly,
the historical information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined company’s results of operations and financial
condition had KCS and CPRL operated as a combined entity during the periods presented, or of the combined company’s results of operations and
financial condition after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval. The combined company’s potential for future business
success and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by recently
combined companies.
In preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, CPRL has given effect
to, among other items, the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the payment of the merger consideration and the
preferred merger consideration and the indebtedness of CPRL on a consolidated basis after giving effect to the combination of CPRL and KCS following
receipt of STB final approval, including the indebtedness of KCS. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information may not reflect
all of the costs that are expected to be incurred by KCS and CPRL in connection with the transaction. For more information, see the section entitled
25

“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information,” on page 171, including the notes thereto.
The substantial additional indebtedness that CP will incur in connection with the transaction could adversely affect CP’s (and after the combination
of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the combined company’s) financial position, including by decreasing its business
flexibility, ability to satisfy its debt obligations and credit ratings.
After the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, the combined company will have substantially increased borrowings
compared to CP’s historical level of borrowings. CP’s consolidated borrowings were approximately C$10.0 billion (U.S.$7.8 billion converted at the Bank of
Canada exchange rate on September 30, 2021) as at September 30, 2021. The combined company’s pro forma borrowings as at September 30, 2021, if the
acquisition of KCS had been completed on that same date, would have been approximately U.S.$20.1 billion, of which U.S.$9.0 billion would have been at
variable rates of interest when assuming borrowings for the transaction are made under the bridge facility.
CP expects to incur approximately U.S.$12.3 billion of additional debt in connection with the transaction relative to debt balances outstanding as at
September 30, 2021, as a result of obtaining financing to complete the transaction and refinancing of debt assumed in the transaction as required. Also, in
connection with the transaction, the existing indebtedness of KCS is expected to remain outstanding to the extent the transaction closes into the voting
trust. This increased level of borrowings could have the effect, among other things, of reducing CP’s liquidity and the combined company’s flexibility to
respond to changing business and economic conditions. Also, the combined company’s ability to make payments of principal and interest on its
indebtedness will depend upon its future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial and business conditions, sufficient cash flow
from KCS during the period in which it is in the voting trust, the implementation of the integration with KCS and other factors affecting its operations,
many of which will be beyond the combined company’s control.
Accordingly, the amount of cash required to service the combined company’s increased borrowing levels and increased aggregate dividends after the
combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval, and thus the demands on the combined company’s cash resources, will be greater
than the amount of cash flows required to service CP’s borrowings and pay dividends prior to the combination. If CP completes the acquisition of KCS
and obtains control of KCS but CP does not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the
combined company does not meet current expectations, then CP’s ability to service CP’s indebtedness may be adversely impacted. The increased levels
of borrowings and dividends after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval could also reduce funds available for the
combined company’s investments in research and development and capital expenditures and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages
for the combined company relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
The agreements that will govern CP’s indebtedness that would be incurred in connection with the acquisition of KCS may contain various affirmative and
negative covenants that may, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict the combined company’s ability to, among other things, create liens over
its property, change its line of business and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of its assets to another person. In
addition, some of the agreements that will govern the combined company’s new debt financings may contain financial covenants that will require it to
maintain certain financial ratios. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company’s control could affect its ability to comply with
these covenants and failure to comply with them could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate repayment
obligations. Under these circumstances, the combined company may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations.
CP’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, CP’s cost of capital. CP’s credit ratings reflect each credit rating
organization’s opinion of CP’s financial and business strength,
26
Table of Contents
operating performance and ability to meet CP’s debt obligations. If any of CP’s credit ratings are reduced, CP may not be able to sell additional debt
securities, borrow money, refinance the transaction facilities if drawn or establish alternatives to the transaction facilities in the amounts, at the times or
interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if CP’s current credit ratings are maintained.
In addition, future borrowings under circumstances in which the combined company’s debt is rated below investment grade may contain further
restrictions that impose significant restrictions on the way the combined company operates after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of
STB final approval.
CPRL or KCS may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder approval or stockholder approval, respectively.
Certain conditions to CPRL’s and KCS’s obligations, respectively, to close the transaction may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally
permissible, either unilaterally or by agreement of CPRL and KCS. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of CPRL’s
shareholders or an amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies or voting cards, as applicable, the parties will have the
discretion to close the transaction without seeking further approval of CPRL shareholders or KCS stockholders, as applicable.
The opinions of KCS’s financial advisors rendered to the KCS board do not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the merger
agreement and the closing of the transaction.
The KCS board has received opinions from Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, KCS’s financial advisors, dated September 15, 2021, to the effect that, as
of the date of the opinions and based on and subject to assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the scope of review undertaken by each financial advisor as described in the written opinions, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the
merger agreement by holders of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, but has not
obtained updated opinions as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations and prospects of CPRL or KCS, general market
and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of CPRL or KCS, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by KCS’s
financial advisors in connection with rendering their respective opinions may have been based, may significantly alter the value of CPRL or KCS or the
prices of the CPRL common shares or of the shares of KCS common stock by the time the transaction is completed. Each opinion did not speak as of the
time the transaction will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion and the KCS board does not anticipate asking its financial
advisors to update their respective opinions. The KCS board’s recommendation that KCS stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the KCS merger
proposal, “FOR” the non-binding compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the KCS adjournment proposal, however, is made as of the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus.
For a description of the opinions that the KCS board received from its financial advisors, see the sections entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Opinion
of BofA Securities” and “The KCS Merger Proposal—Opinion of Morgan Stanley” on pages 85 and 72, respectively. Copies of the opinions of Morgan
Stanley and BofA Securities are attached as Annexes B and C to this proxy statement/prospectus and are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
While the transaction is pending and during the pendency of the voting trust, KCS is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions
that could materially adversely affect KCS’s operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers,
vendors or customers.
The merger agreement generally requires KCS to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary
course prior to the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement and the control date. In addition, the merger agreement includes a variety of
specified restrictions on the conduct of
27
Table of Contents
KCS’s business, which, in the event the merger agreement is not earlier terminated, expire either on the closing date or the control date. Among other
things and subject to the other terms of the merger agreement and certain other exceptions and limitations, KCS may not, outside of the ordinary course
of business, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of KCS’s common stock outside of its equity incentive plans, repurchase common
stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property, dispose of businesses or assets, enter into certain material contracts or make certain
additional capital expenditures. KCS may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the merger agreement delay or prevent KCS from making
certain changes, or limit its ability to make certain changes, during such period, even if KCS’s management believes that making certain changes may be
advisable. The pendency of the transaction may also divert management’s attention and KCS’s resources from ongoing business and operations.
During the period in which KCS is in the voting trust, its existing revolving credit agreement will remain in place, which includes certain limitations on
dividends and distributions to its shareholders, including CPRL at such time. Such limitations may restrict the combined company from receiving the full
benefit of the cash generated by KCS during such period.
KCS’s employees, suppliers, vendors or customers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the transaction. It is possible that some employees,
suppliers, vendors or customers and other parties with whom KCS has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might
decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with KCS as a result of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, current and prospective
employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with KCS following completion of the transaction, which may materially and adversely
affect KCS’s ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact KCS’s operating
results, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price.
CP expects to refinance its credit facility entered into for the purpose of the transaction but cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain new
financing on terms acceptable to it or at all.
CP anticipates that the funds needed to consummate the transaction will be derived from a combination of some or all of: (i) cash on hand; (ii) borrowings
under the credit facility which will be entered into for the purpose of the transaction, its existing credit facilities and/or new credit facilities; and (iii) the
proceeds from the sale of new debt securities and the issuance of any commercial paper. While CP intends to refinance the credit facility for which it has
obtained commitments for the purpose of the transaction, CP’s ability to obtain any new debt financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing
market conditions and other factors beyond CP’s control. CP cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain new debt financing on terms acceptable to it
or at all on or before the maturity date of its credit facilities, and therefore any such failure to refinance could materially adversely affect its operations and
financial condition.
In particular, CP has entered into the commitment letter to backstop permanent debt financings to fund a portion of the cash consideration and preferred
merger consideration and transaction expenses. However, CP has not entered into definitive agreements for such debt financing, and the obligation of the
lenders to provide the debt financing under the commitment letter is subject to a number of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that CP will
be able to obtain the debt financing under the commitment letter. In the event that the debt financing contemplated above is not available, other financing
may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If CP is unable to obtain debt financing, the transaction may be delayed or not be
completed. CPRL’s obligation to complete the transaction is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.
CPRL’s combination with KCS is subject to final approval by the STB, and there can be no assurance as to whether and when it may be approved or
if such approval will be granted with conditions applicable to the parties; accordingly, CPRL’s combination with KCS may be delayed, jeopardized
or prevented entirely and the anticipated benefits of the combination could be reduced.
Although the STB has approved the proposed voting trust agreement, there can be no assurance that third parties will not ask the STB to reconsider that
approval. The STB also has the authority to impose conditions on its
28
Table of Contents
approval of a control transaction to alleviate competitive or other concerns, and, if such conditions are imposed, the anticipated benefits of the
combination of CPRL and KCS might be reduced. There is no assurance that STB final approval will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to CPRL.
In addition, under existing law, railroad competitors of CPRL and KCS and other interested parties may intervene to oppose the STB application or seek
protective conditions in the event approval by the STB is granted, which might delay the approval process or reduce the anticipated benefits of the
combination of CPRL and KCS. Furthermore, if the STB does not provide STB final approval or imposes conditions on its approval in a final order, and
CPRL and KCS decide to appeal such final order from the STB, any such appeal might not be resolved for a substantial period of time after the entry of
such order by the STB.
If either (i) STB final approval has not been obtained by December 31, 2023 or (ii) the STB has, by a final and non-appealable order, refused to provide
STB final approval (which we refer to collectively as an “STB denial”), CPRL would be required to dispose of its initial investment in KCS. Similarly, if the
STB imposes onerous conditions on STB final approval, CPRL may choose to dispose of its initial investment in KCS rather than agreeing to the
conditions imposed by the STB. In either case, CPRL would be obligated under the voting trust agreement to directly or indirectly divest of the trust
stock in a manner that is acceptable to the STB. CPRL and KCS expect that, in case of a divestiture, the market and divestiture alternatives for the trust
stock might be limited, and such a disposition could cause CPRL to incur significant losses and expenses in connection with the transaction, which could
have a significant adverse impact on the business and financial condition of CPRL.
Failure by KCS to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined
company and, consequently, the market value of CPRL common shares.
The success of the combination of CPRL and KCS will depend, in part, on the ability of KCS to successfully execute its business strategy, including
making deliveries in a safe and reliable manner, minimizing service interruptions and investing in its infrastructure to maintain its rail system and serve its
customer base. These objectives are capital intensive. Furthermore, KCS’s business strategy, operations and plans for growth and expansion rely
significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances, as well as interchange, trackage
rights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage that it does
not own. KCS’s ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with
other railroads and third parties, and upon the performance of the obligations under the agreements by the other railroads and third parties. The
termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements and interfere
with its business strategy, operations and plans for growth. If KCS is not able to achieve its business strategy, is not able to achieve its business strategy
on a timely basis, or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with CPRL’s expectations, the anticipated benefits of the combination of CPRL and KCS may
not be realized fully or at all, and the combination may materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
combined company and, consequently, the market value of CPRL common shares.
Failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement could negatively impact the price of KCS voting stock, and future
business and financial results.
If the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed for any reason, including as a result of the failure to obtain the KCS
stockholder approval or the CPRL shareholder approval, KCS’s ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and KCS would be subject to
a number of risks, including the following:
•
KCS may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of KCS common stock, and
from KCS’s employees, suppliers, vendors, regulators or customers;
29
Table of Contents
•
KCS will be required to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million, in consideration for the disposition by CPRL of its contractual
rights under the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including because the KCS board has
changed its recommendation in favor of the transaction or in certain circumstances where, after the date of the merger agreement, KCS
enters into an agreement providing for an alternative proposal (for these purposes, substituting in the definition of alternative proposal
“50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears, and such proposal, a “qualifying transaction”) in respect of KCS
that is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn at least two business days prior to, the KCS special
meeting following termination of the merger agreement;
•
KCS will be required to pay to CPRL the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund if the merger agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances, including (i) by KCS prior to receipt of the KCS stockholder approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing
for a superior proposal in respect of KCS; (ii) by CPRL on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in the merger agreement; or (iii) by CPRL because the KCS board has effected a change of recommendation;
•
the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of KCS’s business, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to
the consent of CPRL, may prevent KCS from making certain material acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain
other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the transaction or, with respect to certain
actions, prior to the control date, that KCS would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and
•
matters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by KCS’s
management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-
to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to KCS as an independent company.
In addition, KCS could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce KCS’s
performance obligations under the merger agreement.
If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect KCS’s business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.
Directors and executive officers of KCS have interests in the transaction that may differ from the interests of KCS stockholders generally, including,
if the transaction is completed, the receipt of financial and other benefits.
In considering the recommendations of the KCS board, KCS stockholders should be aware that KCS’s directors and executive officers have interests in
the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the
treatment of outstanding KCS equity awards under the merger agreement, the potential payment of severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding
KCS equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, retention awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. These
interests are described in more detail in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Transaction,” on page 102.
Except in specified circumstances, if the effective time has not occurred by the end date, either KCS or CPRL may choose not to proceed with the
transaction.
Either KCS or CPRL may terminate the merger agreement if the effective time has not occurred by February 21, 2022 (i.e., the end date); provided, that to
the extent the condition to obtain the authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement has
30
Table of Contents
not been satisfied or waived on or prior to February 21, 2022, but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing), the end date will be automatically extended to May 21, 2022. However, this right to
terminate the merger agreement will not be available to KCS or CPRL if such party has breached in any material respect its obligations under the merger
agreement in any manner that has been the primary cause of the failure to consummate the transaction on or before the end date. For more information,
see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,” on page 164.
There may be less publicly available information concerning CPRL than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because, as a foreign
private issuer, CPRL is exempt from a number of rules under the U.S. Exchange Act and is permitted to file less information with the SEC than
issuers that are not foreign private issuers and CPRL, as a foreign private issuer, is permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing
requirements of NYSE, subject to certain exceptions.
For so long as CPRL remains a foreign private issuer under the U.S. Exchange Act, CPRL is exempt from certain rules under the U.S. Exchange Act.
Although CPRL has chosen to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC, CPRL is
currently not required to do so. CPRL is also not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as
companies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which
restricts the selective disclosure of material non-public information. In addition, CPRL is exempt from certain disclosure and procedural requirements
applicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the U.S. Exchange Act. The members of the CPRL board, officers and principal shareholders are
exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less publicly
available information concerning CPRL than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the U.S. Exchange Act but are not foreign
private issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it is provided by such companies. In addition, certain information may be
provided by CPRL in accordance with Canadian law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the U.S. Exchange
Act. For example, disclosure with respect to CPRL annual meetings of shareholders will be governed by Canadian law. Further, as a foreign private issuer,
under NYSE rules CPRL is subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements, although CPRL’s current corporate governance practices are
consistent with all applicable Canadian and U.S. regulatory guidelines and standards. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of NYSE permit a foreign
private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of NYSE, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as
board, committee and director independence requirements. CPRL is required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices
differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under NYSE listing standards in its annual report filed with the SEC or on its website. Accordingly,
CPRL shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are required to comply with all of the NYSE corporate
governance requirements.
CPRL is organized under the laws of Canada and a substantial portion of its assets are, and many of its directors and officers reside, outside of the
U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. against CPRL, its officers,
or members of the CPRL board.
CPRL is organized under the laws of Canada. A substantial portion of CPRL’s assets are located outside the U.S., and many of CPRL’s directors and
officers and some of the experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and the assets of such
persons may be located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service within the U.S. upon CPRL and those directors,
officers and experts, or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against CPRL or such persons either inside or outside of the U.S., or to enforce in
U.S. courts judgments obtained against CPRL or such persons in courts in jurisdictions outside the U.S., in any action predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the U.S.
31
Table of Contents
There is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the U.S. can be enforced in Canada, whether by original
action or by seeking to enforce a judgment of U.S. courts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be
unenforceable in Canada.
Resales of CPRL common shares following the transaction may cause the market value of CPRL common shares to decline.
Based on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding as of October 29, 2021,
CPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 262,637,917 CPRL common
shares at the effective time in connection with the transaction. The issuance of these new CPRL common shares could have the effect of depressing the
market value for CPRL common shares. The increase in the number of CPRL common shares may lead to sales of such CPRL common shares or the
perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, CPRL common shares.
The market value of CPRL common shares may decline as a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval.
The market value of CPRL common shares may decline as a result of the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB final approval if, among
other things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected growth in revenues and earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in
connection with the integration of KCS’s and CPRL’s businesses are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the transaction are greater than
expected. The market value of CPRL common shares also may decline if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the
combination as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the market or if the effect of the combination on the combined company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition, some KCS common stockholders may
decide not to continue to hold the CPRL common shares they receive as a result of the transaction, and any such sales of CPRL common shares could
have the effect of depressing their market price. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or
liquidity of, CPRL common shares, regardless of CPRL’s actual operating performance after the combination of CPRL and KCS following receipt of STB
final approval.
Current CPRL shareholders and KCS common stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction and will exercise
less influence over the management of the combined company.
Based on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding as of October 29, 2021,
at the effective time, CPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately
262,637,917 CPRL common shares at the effective time in connection with the transaction. As a result, it is expected that, immediately after the effective
time, former KCS common stockholders would own approximately 28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares. See the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of KCS Equity Awards,” on page 141 for a more detailed explanation. Consequently,
current CPRL shareholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have
over the management and policies of CPRL, and KCS common stockholders in the aggregate will have significantly less influence over the management
and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the management and policies of KCS.
KCS and CPRL may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the
transaction from being completed.
Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the
lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a
plaintiff is successful in obtaining
32
Table of Contents
an injunction prohibiting consummation of the transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and
operations.
The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties due to the
combination of CPRL’s business and KCS’s business following receipt of STB final approval. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the
combined company’s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to the combined company’s operations.
If the transaction is not treated as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or if the requirements of Section 367(a) of the Code are
not met, holders of KCS common stock may be required to recognize a greater amount of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon their
exchange shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration.
Although KCS’s obligation to complete the transaction is conditioned on its receipt of an opinion from external counsel, to the effect that, on the basis of
facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not generally apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition to holders
of KCS common stock (other than excepted shareholders), neither CPRL nor KCS has applied for, or expects to obtain, a ruling from the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
the IRS will agree with the conclusions reached in such opinion or that it will not challenge the intended U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
transaction. If the transaction were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders (as defined below in the section
entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” on page 120) of KCS common stock would recognize gain or
loss on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction qualified as a reorganization but were to fail to satisfy the
requirements of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, U.S. holders of KCS common stock would be required to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not
loss, on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration.
For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. holders, see the section entitled “The KCS
Merger Proposal—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” on page 120.
The IRS may not agree that CPRL should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation generally will be considered to be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes only if it
is created or organized in the U.S. or under the law of the U.S. or of any State. Accordingly, under generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, CPRL,
which is organized under the laws of Canada, would generally be classified as a foreign corporation. Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a foreign corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (or to be subject to certain other adverse tax consequences). CPRL believes that it should not be treated as a U.S. corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code immediately following the transaction. There can be no assurance, however, that the
IRS will not take a contrary position or that the relevant U.S. federal income tax law will not be changed (possibly with retroactive effect) in a manner that
would result in a contrary conclusion. If it were determined that CPRL is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section
7874 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, CPRL could be subject to substantial U.S. tax liability and its non-U.S.
shareholders could be subject to U.S. withholding tax on any dividends.

CPRL and KCS may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the combination of CPRL
and KCS.
Uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on CPRL and KCS employees may have an adverse effect on each of CPRL and KCS separately and
consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair CPRL’s and/or KCS’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee
retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the transaction, as employees of CPRL and KCS may experience uncertainty about their
future roles in the combined company.
Additionally, KCS’s officers and employees may hold shares of KCS voting stock, and, if the transaction closes, these officers and employees may be
entitled to the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, in respect of such shares of KCS voting stock. Under agreements
between KCS and certain of its key employees, such employees could potentially resign from employment on or after the effective time following
specified circumstances constituting good reason or constructive termination (as set forth in the applicable agreement) that could result in severance
payments to such employees and accelerated vesting of their equity awards. These payments and accelerated vesting benefits, individually or in the
aggregate, could make retention of KCS key employees more difficult.
Furthermore, if key employees of CPRL or KCS depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of
integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, CPRL may have to incur significant costs in retaining such
individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent, and the combined
company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the
combined company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that CP and KCS have been able to attract or retain employees in the
past.
Following the control date, it is expected that the board of directors of the combined company and the Management Resources and Compensation
Committee of the combined company (or such other committee(s) with responsibility for compensation matters) will meet to determine and oversee the
compensation of the independent Board Chair and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and the director and executive
compensation structure and policies of the combined company. These are anticipated to generally be consistent with the existing executive compensation
structure and policies of CPRL and may include long-term performance based equity awards such as PSUs and/or stock options tied to the expected
synergies of the combined company. To assess and determine the executive and director compensation structure and policies of the combined company,
the board of directors of the combined company and the combined company’s Management Resources and Compensation Committee may retain and use
reports prepared by independent compensation advisors or consultants.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for CPRL and KCS to pursue alternatives to the transaction and may
discourage other companies from trying to acquire KCS for greater consideration than what CPRL has agreed to pay.
The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for KCS to sell its business to a party other than CPRL, or for CPRL to sell its
business. These provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any alternative proposal. Further, there are only limited circumstances in
which KCS may terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal and limited exceptions to each party’s agreement that its board of
directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement. In the event that the KCS board makes an adverse recommendation change, then KCS may be required to pay to CPRL a termination
payment of $700.0 million and the CN termination amount refund of $700.0 million. In the event that the CPRL board makes an adverse recommendation
change, then CPRL may be required to pay to KCS a termination payment of $700.0 million. See “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation” and “The
Merger Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,” on pages 151 and 164, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.
34
Table of Contents
The parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions might discourage a third party that has an
interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either KCS or CPRL from considering or proposing an alternative proposal.
If an alternative proposal to acquire KCS is made, consummation of the transaction may be delayed.
If an alternative proposal to acquire KCS is made, the attention of KCS’s and CPRL’s respective management may be diverted away from the transaction,
which may delay or impede consummation of the transaction. Matters related to such alternative proposal, including any potential related litigation, may
require commitments of time and resources of both parties and their respective representatives, which could otherwise have been devoted to the
transaction.
The financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—KCS Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” on page 97 were based on assumptions of, and information available to, the management team of KCS when prepared and these
estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of KCS and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned
in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this “Risk Factors” section and the events or circumstances described under
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” will be important in determining the combined company’s future results. As a result of
these contingencies, actual future results may vary materially from the estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of financial estimates in this
proxy statement/prospectus is not and should not be viewed as a representation that the forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.
The financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—KCS Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” on page 97 were based on assumptions that were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and such financial estimates
were not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of any regulatory or professional body. Further, any forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and KCS and CPRL do not undertake any obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to
update the financial estimates in this proxy statement/prospectus to reflect events or circumstances after the date those financial estimates were prepared
or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The prospective financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KCS’s management. This prospective financial information was not prepared
with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. See “The KCS Merger Proposal—KCS Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” on page 97 for more information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-
upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates
to KCS’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.
Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of CPRL common shares and any dividends.
CPRL common shares are quoted in Canadian dollars on the TSX and U.S. dollars on the NYSE. Dividends in respect of CPRL common shares, if any, are
anticipated to be declared in Canadian dollars, consistent with CPRL’s current dividend practice. CPRL’s financial statements are prepared in Canadian
dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar will affect, among other matters, the U.S. dollar value of CPRL
common shares and of any dividends in respect of such shares.

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
From time to time, CPRL and KCS make written or oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the “safe
harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. This proxy
statement/prospectus, including information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, may contain certain forward-looking
statements and forward-looking information (which we refer to as “FLI”) to provide CPRL and KCS shareholders and potential investors with information
about CPRL, KCS and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, including each company’s management’s respective assessment of CPRL, KCS and their
respective subsidiaries’ future plans and operations, which FLI may not be appropriate for other purposes. FLI is typically identified by words such as
“anticipate,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “plan,” “intend,” “target,” “believe,” “likely” and similar words suggesting future outcomes or
statements regarding an outlook. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be FLI.
Although we believe that the FLI is reasonable based on the information available today and processes used to prepare it, such statements are not
guarantees of future performance and you are cautioned against placing undue reliance on FLI. By its nature, FLI involves a variety of assumptions,
which are based upon factors that may be difficult to predict and that may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors which
may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these FLI, including, but not limited
to, the following: the timing and completion of the transaction, including receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of other
conditions precedent; interloper risk; the realization of anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction and the timing thereof; the success of
integration plans; the focus of management time and attention on the transaction and other disruptions arising from the transaction; changes in business
strategy and strategic opportunities; estimated future dividends; financial strength and flexibility; debt and equity market conditions, including the ability
to access capital markets on favorable terms or at all; cost of debt and equity capital; potential changes in the CPRL share price which may negatively
impact the value of consideration offered to KCS shareholders; the ability of management of CPRL, its subsidiaries and affiliates to execute key priorities,
including those in connection with the transaction; general Canadian, U.S., Mexican and global social, economic, political, credit and business
conditions; risks associated with agricultural production such as weather conditions and insect populations; the availability and price of energy
commodities; the effects of competition and pricing pressures, including competition from other rail carriers, trucking companies and maritime shippers in
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico; North American and global economic growth; industry capacity; shifts in market demand; changes in commodity prices
and commodity demand; uncertainty surrounding timing and volumes of commodities being shipped; inflation; geopolitical instability; changes in laws,
regulations and government policies, including regulation of rates; changes in taxes and tax rates; potential increases in maintenance and operating
costs; changes in fuel prices; disruption in fuel supplies; uncertainties of investigations, proceedings or other types of claims and litigation; compliance
with environmental regulations; labor disputes; changes in labor costs and labor difficulties; risks and liabilities arising from derailments; transportation
of dangerous goods; timing of completion of capital and maintenance projects; sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out business
plans; services and infrastructure; the satisfaction by third parties of their obligations; currency and interest rate fluctuations; exchange rates; effects of
changes in market conditions and discount rates on the financial position of pension plans and investments; trade restrictions or other changes to
international trade arrangements; the effects of current and future multinational trade agreements on the level of trade among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico; climate change and the market and regulatory responses to climate change; ability to achieve commitments and aspirations relating to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related objectives; anticipated in-service dates; success of hedging activities; operational performance and
reliability; customer, shareholder, regulatory and other stakeholder approvals and support; regulatory and legislative decisions and actions; the adverse
impact of any termination or revocation by the Mexican government of KCSM’s concession; public opinion; various events that could disrupt
operations, including severe weather, such as droughts, floods, avalanches and earthquakes, and cybersecurity attacks, as well as security threats and
governmental response to them, and technological changes; acts of terrorism, war or other acts of violence or
37Table of Contents
crime or risk of such activities; insurance coverage limitations; material adverse changes in economic and industry conditions, including the availability
of short- and long-term financing; and the pandemic created by the outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants, and resulting effects on economic conditions,
the demand environment for logistics requirements and energy prices, restrictions imposed by public health authorities or governments, fiscal and
monetary policy responses by governments and financial institutions, and disruptions to global supply chains.
We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive and is made as of the date hereof. Additional information about these and other
assumptions, risks and uncertainties can be found in reports and filings by CPRL and KCS with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators, including any
proxy statement, prospectus, material change report, management information circular or registration statement to be filed in connection with the
transaction. Reference should be made to “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
—Forward Looking Statements” in CPRL’s and KCS’s annual and interim reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of
these factors, as well as other factors, the impact of any one assumption, risk or uncertainty on FLI cannot be determined with certainty.
Except to the extent required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any FLI, whether as a result of new information, future events
or otherwise. All FLI in this proxy statement/prospectus is expressly qualified in its entirety by these cautionary statements.
For additional information about factors that could cause CPRL’s and KCS’s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors,” on page 22 as well as in the reports that KCS and CPRL have filed with the SEC and SEDAR,
as applicable, described in the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information,” on page 230.

The record date to determine stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the KCS special meeting or any adjournments or

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,"Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
A quorum of KCS stockholders is necessary to conduct the KCS special meeting. The presence (including virtually) or representation by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the KCS capital stock issued and entitled to vote at the KCS special meeting will constitute a
quorum. Shares of KCS voting stock represented at the KCS special meeting by attendance via the special meeting website or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a stockholder directs an “abstention” from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining
a quorum. However, because all of the KCS proposals are considered “non-routine” matters under NYSE rules (as described below), shares held in “street
name” will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the stockholder provides their bank, broker or other
nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals before the KCS special meeting. If a quorum is not present, the KCS special meeting
may be adjourned or postponed until the holders of the number of shares of KCS voting stock required to constitute a quorum attend.
Under the NYSE rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” on behalf of the beneficial owner of such shares have the
authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain “routine” proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owners. However, banks, brokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under the NYSE rules,
as applicable, are “non-routine.” This can result in a “broker non-vote”, which occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has
discretionary authority to vote on one or more “routine” proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other
“non-routine” proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or
other nominee with voting instructions on a “non-routine” matter. All of the KCS proposals are considered “non-routine” matters under the NYSE rules,
and banks, brokers or other nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the meeting. As a result, KCS does not expect
any broker non-votes at the KCS special meeting and, if you hold your shares of KCS voting stock in “street name”, your shares will not be represented
and will not be voted on any matter unless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the
voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you cast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote on any of the KCS proposals unless they have received voting instructions from the
beneficial owners.

If a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the KCS special meeting to approve the KCS merger
proposal, then KCS stockholders may be asked to vote on the KCS adjournment proposal.
At any subsequent reconvening of the KCS special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the KCS

Shares held through the KCS 401(k) Plan must be voted prior to the meeting and by 9:00 a.m. Central Time on December 8, 2021.
Unless properly and timely revoked in one of the manners set forth in the section entitled “The KCS Special Meeting—Revocability of Proxies and
Changes to a KCS Stockholder’s Vote,” on page 45, all duly executed proxies representing shares of KCS voting stock entitled to vote will be voted at
the KCS special meeting and,
44Table of Contents
where a choice has been specified on the proxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If you submit an executed proxy without
providing instructions with respect to any proposal, then the KCS officers identified on the proxy will vote your shares consistent with the
recommendation of the KCS board on such proposal. If you are a stockholder of record, proxies submitted over the internet or by telephone as described
above must be received by 9:00 a.m. Central Time, on December 10, 2021. To reduce administrative costs and help the environment by conserving natural
resources, KCS asks that you vote through the internet or by telephone.
By executing and delivering a proxy in connection with the KCS special meeting, you designate certain KCS directors identified therein as your proxies at
the KCS special meeting. If you deliver an executed proxy, but do not specify a choice with respect to any proposal properly brought before the KCS
special meeting, such proxies will vote your underlying shares of KCS voting stock on such uninstructed proposal in accordance with the
recommendation of the KCS board. KCS does not expect that any matter other than the KCS proposals will be brought before the KCS special meeting
and the KCS by-laws provide that the only business that may be conducted at the KCS special meeting are those proposals brought before the meeting
by or at the direction of the KCS board.
Voting and Submitting a Proxy for KCS Voting Stock Held in “Street Name”

instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote your shares. Your voting instructions must be received by your bank, broker
or other nominee prior to the deadline set forth in the information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. If you
do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee with respect to a proposal, your shares of KCS voting stock will not be voted
on that proposal as your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the KCS proposals; see the section
entitled “The KCS Special Meeting—Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,” on page 42.

materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the

in sequential order: (i) CPRL will transfer all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation to CPRC as a capital
contribution; (ii) CPRC will immediately thereafter transfer all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation to merger
holdco as a capital contribution; (iii) merger holdco will immediately thereafter assume any indebtedness of the second surviving corporation owing to
CPRC or its affiliates (being the amount borrowed by surviving merger sub to pay the cash consideration and preferred merger consideration) in
consideration for a non-interest bearing promissory note issued by second surviving corporation to merger holdco, which promissory note will
immediately thereafter be transferred to second surviving corporation as a capital contribution and the promissory note will accordingly be extinguished;

reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares involving KCS common stock, KCS
preferred stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time, to proportionally reflect such change.
As used in this proxy statement/prospectus, the term “total purchase consideration” collectively refers to the merger consideration, the preferred merger
consideration, cash amounts payable at the effective time in respect of all KCS equity awards, amounts remitted by CPRL to KCS in connection with the
CN agreement termination payment and CN refund, and other amounts as defined as consideration by the acquisition method of accounting.
Based on the number of shares of KCS common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares outstanding as of October 29, 2021,
CPRL expects to issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of surviving merger sub) up to approximately 262,637,917 CPRL common
shares to KCS common stockholders at the effective time under the merger agreement. The actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued under the
merger agreement will be determined immediately prior to the effective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock
outstanding at such time and the number of KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares. Based on the number of shares of KCS
common stock, KCS restricted share awards and KCS director deferred shares outstanding as of October 29, 2021, and the number of CPRL common
shares outstanding as of October 29, 2021, immediately after the first merger, former KCS common stockholders are expected to own approximately 28% of
the issued and outstanding CPRL common shares.
Based on the closing price of CPRL common shares of $72.71 on the NYSE on August 9, 2021, the last full trading day prior to that on which CPRL
submitted a revised offer to acquire KCS, the implied value of the merger consideration to holders of KCS common stock was approximately $299.70 per
share of KCS common stock. The merger consideration provides a premium to KCS stockholders of approximately 34%, based on closing share price of
CPRL common shares on August 9, 2021, and the unaffected closing price of KCS common stock on March 19, 2021, the last full trading day before the
public announcement of the prior CP merger agreement. The implied value of the merger consideration will fluctuate, however, as the market price of CPRL
common shares fluctuates, because the merger consideration that is payable per share of KCS common stock is a fixed fraction of a CPRL common share.
As a result, the value of the merger consideration that KCS common stockholders will receive upon the closing of the transaction could be greater than,
less than or the same as the value of the merger consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the KCS special meeting.
Accordingly, you are encouraged to obtain current share price quotations for KCS common stock and CPRL common shares before deciding how to vote
with respect to the approval of the merger agreement. KCS common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol “KSU” and CPRL common shares trade
on the NYSE and the TSX under the symbol “CP.” The price of CPRL common shares on the NYSE is reported in U.S. dollars, while the price of CPRL
common shares on the TSX is reported in Canadian dollars.

The KCS board and senior management team periodically review and evaluate KCS’s long-term strategy and the range of strategic opportunities that
might be available to it to strengthen KCS’s business and to enhance stockholder value. As part of this ongoing evaluation, management maintains a
long-range plan (the “KCS long-range plan”), which is periodically updated and reviewed with the KCS board, that reflects management’s financial and
business outlook for KCS over a ten-year period. In addition, the KCS board and management team have, from time to time in the past, discussed and
considered the possibility of entering into strategic transactions with other parties.
On July 29, 2020, Patrick Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer of KCS, and Keith Creel, President and Chief Executive Officer of CPRL, had a
lunch meeting at which they discussed a variety of industry topics. During this meeting, Mr. Creel raised whether KCS would be amenable to discussing a
business combination of CPRL and KCS. No further actions were taken by the KCS management team or board at the time with respect to Mr. Creel’s
inquiry.
Beginning on July 31, 2020, several financial media outlets reported that an investor consortium was considering making a takeover proposal for KCS.
Following these reports, the KCS board and senior management reached out to its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, and its outside counsel, Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), to discuss the reports and the question of how KCS should respond if a proposal were made.
On August 11, 2020, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Wachtell Lipton, to
discuss the financial media reports and the possibility of a proposal, including the KCS board’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law and preliminary
perspectives on valuation for KCS based on the KCS long-range plan and Wall Street research analyst forecasts. Thereafter, KCS reached out to BofA
Securities to join Morgan Stanley as KCS’s and the KCS board’s financial advisor. KCS and the KCS board determined to engage both Morgan Stanley
and BofA based on, among other things, each firm’s overall reputation and experience as an investment banking firm, each firm’s substantial experience in
the transportation sector, and the belief that having the benefit of both firms’ advice would be in the best interests of KCS and its stockholders.
On August 17, 2020, Robert Druten, the Chairman of the KCS board, and Mr. Ottensmeyer received an unsolicited written proposal from an investor
consortium (“Party A”) to acquire KCS for $195.00 per share in cash. The proposal indicated that Party A intended to finance the acquisition through a
combination of equity financing and $6.5 billion in debt financing, and that Party A anticipated obtaining all regulatory approvals within four to six
months of signing a definitive agreement. Messrs. Druten and Ottensmeyer notified the KCS board of the receipt of Party A’s proposal and, later that day,
Mr. Ottensmeyer and Michael Upchurch, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of KCS, participated in a conversation with
representatives of Party A to discuss the terms of the proposal.
A special meeting of the KCS board was convened on August 18, 2020, with members of senior management, and representatives of Morgan Stanley and
Wachtell Lipton, to discuss Party A’s proposal and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley shared their perspectives on the financial
terms of Party A’s proposal. Members of management also reviewed the KCS long-range plan and the opportunities and risks associated with executing
on KCS’s long-term strategy. The KCS board discussed these considerations and perspectives and concluded that KCS should remain focused on its
long-term strategic plans and should not pursue Party A’s proposal. Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch subsequently conveyed the KCS board’s
conclusion to representatives of Party A.
On August 21, 2020, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to propose that CPRL and KCS consider entering into a merger-of-equals transaction in which KCS
stockholders would receive consideration consisting solely of CPRL common shares, in an at-market transaction. Mr. Creel expressed his view that,
relative to the other Class 1 railroad companies, a transaction involving CPRL and KCS would likely face the least amount of
50Table of Contents
regulatory uncertainty given the companies’ status as the two smallest Class 1 railroad companies in North America and their lack of geographic overlap.
During the same week, a representative of Party A contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to request a meeting to further discuss the possibility of a transaction.
During the following week, Jean-Jacques Ruest, President and Chief Executive Officer of CN, contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer telephonically to note the
financial media reports regarding a possible takeover proposal. Mr. Ruest stated that, if KCS was interested in a sale, CN would be interested in
discussing such a transaction. No further actions were taken by the KCS management team or board to engage with CN at the time.
On August 28, 2020, the KCS board met with members of senior management and a representative of Wachtell Lipton. The KCS board discussed Party A’s
request for a meeting and instructed Mr. Ottensmeyer to accept the request. Representatives of KCS management then reviewed possible exchange ratios
implied by the historical trading prices of KCS common stock and CPRL common shares, as well as possible exchange ratios implied by the relative
contributions of various financial metrics of KCS and CPRL. The KCS board discussed potential responses and determined not to take action with
respect to CPRL’s proposal at the time, pending Mr. Ottensmeyer’s discussion with Party A and Party A’s response. Mr. Ottensmeyer also described his
conversation with Mr. Ruest of CN. In the days following the KCS board meeting, Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch had a discussion with
representatives of Party A with respect to Party A’s interest in a possible transaction.
On August 31, 2020, Party A submitted an updated, unsolicited written proposal to acquire KCS for $208.00 per share in cash, subject otherwise to the
same terms and conditions set forth in Party A’s August 17th proposal. The next day, Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch participated in a conversation
with representatives of Party A to discuss the updated proposal.
A meeting of the KCS board was held on September 2, 2020, with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities
and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities discussed the terms of Party A’s proposal and CPRL’s proposal and
presented preliminary perspectives on valuation for KCS based on the KCS long-range plan. After consideration of these and other factors, the KCS
board again concluded that KCS should remain focused on its long-term strategic plans and determined that KCS should not pursue either Party A’s
proposal or CPRL’s proposal. The KCS board did, however, believe that KCS should engage in discussions with CPRL about possible commercial
opportunities or arrangements that could be in both companies’ interests. Thereafter, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board’s conclusions to
representatives of Party A and to Mr. Creel.
From September to November 2020, the KCS board continued to discuss and review KCS’s long-term strategic plan and strategic opportunities in
consultation with senior management and KCS’s external advisors. In addition, representatives of KCS and CPRL met on September 14 and 15, 2020 to
discuss possible commercial opportunities or arrangements outside the context of a combination. The representatives of CPRL also provided their views
on a potential at-market combination of KCS and CPRL.
On September 23, 2020, the KCS board met with members of management to further analyze and consider KCS’s financial and business outlook and
strategic options, including KCS’s outlook as an independent company and an analysis of combinations with various other railroads. The KCS board also
discussed the investor feedback received by KCS management following the publication of a September 9th financial media report that KCS had rejected
the acquisition proposal that had reportedly been made for $208.00 per share in cash.
On October 20, 2020, the KCS board convened a meeting for informational purposes with members of management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton to discuss various strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company. This included a discussion
led by representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities regarding illustrative buyout and ability-to-pay analyses with respect to Party A and
various railroads who could be potential buyers.

On November 11, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer and Mr. Creel had a telephonic discussion on which they agreed that, given the political uncertainties following
the recent U.S. election and the fact that KCS and CPRL were each focused on closing the fiscal year and preparing for the upcoming earnings season,
KCS and CPRL would discontinue their discussions regarding potential commercial opportunities at such time and potentially revisit the idea of a
strategic combination of the two companies in the future.
On November 17, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer received a call from a representative of another Class 1 railroad company expressing interest in a potential
acquisition of a portion of KCS’s assets. Mr. Ottensmeyer reported this conversation to the KCS board, but no further actions were taken by the KCS
management team or KCS board to engage with such railroad company.
On November 23, 2020, representatives of Party A contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to inform him that Party A intended to submit a revised proposal to acquire
KCS for $230.00 per share in cash, which Party A submitted later that day. The revised proposal noted that Party A had high confidence that it would be
able to obtain firm commitments from its equity partners and lenders once the parameters of a transaction had been agreed upon.
The KCS board met on December 2, 2020, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and
KCS’s legal advisors, to discuss Party A’s revised proposal and potential next steps. Mr. Upchurch discussed the KCS long-range plan and KCS’s general
strategic positioning. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities provided their preliminary perspectives on valuation for KCS based on the
KCS long-range plan. The KCS board discussed the terms of Party A’s proposal and the possibility of contacting CPRL, and potentially other Class 1
railroads, to determine their interest in submitting a proposal to acquire KCS. The KCS board reviewed potential synergy estimates and the possible
merger consideration such parties could offer to KCS stockholders. The KCS board also discussed the timing and certainty of consummating a
transaction with a Class 1 railroad company in light of the regulatory framework for such a transaction. Among other things, the KCS board and
management team discussed the possibility of addressing potential uncertainties by employing a voting trust structure in which an acquiring Class 1
railroad would close the acquisition and immediately deposit the shares of KCS into an independent voting trust, with KCS stockholders receiving their
merger consideration at that time and prior to the acquiror’s receipt of final control approval from the STB.
After deliberation, the KCS board determined that Party A’s proposal was not at a value that the KCS board was prepared to accept, but authorized
management to begin providing Party A with due diligence materials, subject to the execution of a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement, so that
Party A could have an opportunity to submit an improved proposal. The KCS board also directed Mr. Ottensmeyer to notify Mr. Creel that KCS was now
considering a potential transaction and would be willing to consider an acquisition proposal from CPRL that contemplated a significant control premium
and a voting trust structure to address timing and regulatory issues. After consideration of the risks associated with a broader outreach effort, the KCS
board determined not to contact other parties at the time and to revisit the question of reaching out to additional parties at a later date. After the KCS
board meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer reached out to Party A and to Mr. Creel with the messages determined by the KCS board.
On December 4, 2020, KCS entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A, which contained customary standstill restrictions on Party A (which
restrictions would terminate in the event any person acquired or became the owner of, or entered into a definitive agreement to acquire or become the
owner of, more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of KCS or assets of KCS representing more than 50% of its consolidated earning power).
On December 8, 2020, KCS entered into formal engagement letters with Morgan Stanley and with BofA Securities to provide advice to KCS and the KCS
board with respect to KCS’s strategic alternatives.
On December 9, 2020, CPRL submitted a written proposal to acquire KCS for 0.469 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.345 shares after giving effect
to the share split) and $77.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $235.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the
market price of CPRL
52
Table of Contents
common shares at the time). The proposal also contemplated that a transaction would be effectuated using a voting trust structure, which CPRL
anticipated consummating within four months of signing a definitive agreement, with CPRL taking control of KCS following STB final approval within
eight to twelve months thereafter. Mr. Ottensmeyer and other members of management subsequently participated in a call with Mr. Creel and other
members of CPRL management to discuss the terms of CPRL’s proposal. On December 9, 2020, KCS entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement with
CPRL, which contained customary standstill restrictions on CPRL (which restrictions would terminate in the event any person acquired or became the
owner of, or entered into a definitive agreement to acquire or become the owner of, more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of KCS or assets
of KCS representing more than 50% of its consolidated earning power).
On December 10, 2020, senior executives of each of CPRL and KCS (including Mr. Creel and Mr. Ottensmeyer) met, and CPRL presented the terms of its
December 9 proposal.
The KCS board held a meeting on December 14, 2020 at which it discussed CPRL’s proposal and the substance of the management team’s conversation
with CPRL. The KCS board then determined that CPRL’s proposal was not at a value that the KCS board was prepared to accept, but authorized
management to begin providing CPRL with due diligence materials under the mutual confidentiality agreement, so that CPRL could have an opportunity to
submit an improved proposal.
Through December 2020, KCS provided Party A and CPRL with access to a virtual data room and various business and legal due diligence materials,
including a copy of the KCS long-range plan and hosted management presentations and diligence sessions for the benefit of Party A and CPRL. CPRL
also provided KCS with access to a virtual data room and various reverse diligence materials.
On December 22, 2020, the KCS board held a special meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA
Securities and KCS’s legal advisors. Mr. Upchurch presented an update to the KCS long-range plan, which had been adjusted upwards to reflect
management’s more optimistic financial and operational outlook for KCS as a result of the expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a lower
cost structure resulting from an acceleration of Precision Scheduled Railroading initiatives. Members of management then provided an update regarding
the status of Party A’s and CPRL’s ongoing diligence efforts, as well as internal discussions regarding the regulatory process and potential issues
associated with a strategic transaction. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities also shared their perspectives on the financial terms of
Party A’s and CPRL’s latest proposals and refreshed their perspectives on valuation for KCS to reflect the new financial terms of those proposals and the
updated KCS long-range plan.
On December 28, 2020, Party A sent an updated written proposal to Messrs. Ottensmeyer and Upchurch to acquire KCS for $235.00 per share in cash. The
proposal noted that, pursuant to the restrictions in its confidentiality agreement with KCS, Party A had not informed its equity partners or lenders of its
recent conversations with KCS, but that Party A remained highly confident of the availability of financing for a transaction.
On December 30, 2020, Mr. Ottensmeyer reached out to Mr. Creel to alert him that KCS would need CPRL to promptly provide a revised offer if CPRL was
still interested in pursuing a potential transaction, so that KCS could determine whether it would be willing to move towards a deal with CPRL or with a
competing bidder.
On December 31, 2020, CPRL submitted an updated written proposal to acquire KCS for 0.489 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common
shares after giving effect to the share split) and $78.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $248.00 per share of KCS common
stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time).
The KCS board met on January 7, 2021, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS’s
legal advisors. Mr. Ottensmeyer provided an update on the status of KCS’s discussions with Party A and with CPRL and outlined potential next steps.
Mr. Ottensmeyer offered his
53
Table of Contents
perspective that a potential combination with CPRL would be attractive for KCS and its stockholders and his expectation that CPRL could further increase
its purchase price given potential synergies. Members of the KCS board and management also entered into a discussion regarding the updated KCS
long-range plan and a range of potential synergies for a combination with CPRL. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities provided their
perspectives on the latest proposals received from Party A and from CPRL. The Company’s Chief Legal Officer then described the expected regulatory
approval process and potential timeline in the event KCS pursued a transaction with a Class 1 railroad company. After discussion, the KCS board
determined not to accept either of the proposals that had been most recently submitted by Party A and by CPRL. The KCS board directed Mr.
Ottensmeyer to communicate to representatives of each party that the KCS board was not prepared to proceed with a transaction at its proposed
purchase price, but that the KCS board was willing to allow each party to complete its confirmatory due diligence (and, in the case of Party A, to reengage
with its financing partners) with the expectation that the parties would complete diligence efforts by early-to-mid February and revert with their best and
final offers. In addition, the KCS board again discussed the possibility of reaching out to other parties to ascertain their potential interest in a transaction,
but, for the same reasons considered at its previous meeting on December 2, 2020, determined not to do so at the time and to revisit the question again in
the future.
In the days following the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board’s decisions to representatives of Party A and CPRL. Through the
course of January and February 2021, members of KCS management, together with representatives of KCS’s legal and financial advisors, continued to
engage with and to address due diligence requests from Party A and from CPRL. Members of the KCS board also periodically met and consulted with
members of management regarding the status of the process and to discuss transaction-related issues. On January 22 and 23, 2021, representatives of
KCS, including Messrs. Druten and Ottensmeyer, met with representatives of CPRL to discuss CPRL’s views on regulatory considerations and other
issues relating to a potential combination with CPRL.
Following a meeting of the CPRL board on January 25, 2021, Mr. Creel contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to discuss the potential transaction and the timeline to
announcing a transaction. Mr. Ottensmeyer informed Mr. Creel that KCS expected to receive a revised offer from a competing bidder by mid-February and
noted that the competing bidder’s offer would not have the regulatory complexity and need for a voting trust structure that would exist in a transaction
with CPRL. Mr. Ottensmeyer explained that KCS remained committed to evaluating offers from both CPRL and the competing bidder and continuing to
hold working sessions with CPRL and its representatives to determine whether there was a path to a potential transaction with CPRL. Mr. Creel conveyed
to Mr. Ottensmeyer that CPRL would be committed to engaging with KCS to complete its diligence and finalize the transaction structure and the terms of
the merger agreement over the coming weeks, and that CPRL would be prepared to provide its final offer on value and price by mid-February, such that
CPRL and KCS would be in a position to announce a transaction by the end of February 2021 should KCS choose to move forward with CPRL.
On January 26, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting with members of management and its legal advisors to specifically discuss potential regulatory
considerations and issues relating to a strategic combination, including an assessment of the process for a voting trust transaction and obtaining final
regulatory approval for the potential merger. The KCS board also convened meetings on February 4, 2021 and February 15, 2021, at which the KCS board
reviewed the status of KCS’s discussions with Party A and CPRL and discussed potential next steps.
On February 16, 2021, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to inform him that CPRL would not be submitting a revised proposal until KCS confirmed that it
had also received a revised competing proposal from the competing bidder. Mr. Ottensmeyer subsequently had separate discussions with both Mr. Creel
and representatives of Party A regarding the status and timing with respect to the submission of revised bids.
On March 3, 2021, KCS received updated acquisition proposals from Party A and from CPRL. Party A’s proposal contemplated an all-cash purchase price
of $245.00 per share. The proposal indicated that Party A had re-engaged with its equity partners and that it was highly confident that the equity partners
would be able to
54
Table of Contents
secure final internal approvals upon confirmation of the key transaction terms over a two- to three-week period. The proposal also noted that Party A
believed the credit committee approvals that its lenders had received in August 2020 remained valid, although it had not engaged in any recent
discussions with its lenders in light of the restrictions in its confidentiality agreement with KCS. CPRL’s proposal contemplated a purchase price of 0.489
of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common shares after giving effect to the share split) and $81.00 in cash per share of KCS common
stock (equal to approximately $260.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time). The proposal
indicated that CPRL anticipated consummating the voting trust transaction within four to six months after the signing of the merger agreement, with the
acquisition of control within eight to twelve months thereafter. CPRL’s proposal also contemplated a $400.0 million reverse termination fee payable to KCS
in the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the inability to complete the voting trust transaction as a result of STB regulatory issues.
Furthermore, CPRL’s proposal contemplated the renaming of the combined company to “Canadian Pacific Kansas City”, with the U.S. headquarters of the
combined company to be located in Kansas City, and indicated that CPRL would be open to considering KCS director representation on its board
following consummation of the voting trust transaction.
In the subsequent days, with the authorization of the KCS board, members of KCS management circulated a draft merger agreement to representatives of
CPRL. The draft included, among other terms, a customary “fiduciary out” provision that would permit the KCS board to terminate its existing agreement
with an acquirer in order to accept an alternative acquisition proposal from a third party under certain circumstances. In addition, the draft merger
agreement provided to CPRL contemplated a reverse termination fee representing 7.0% of the transaction consideration (or approximately $1.7 billion
based on CPRL’s then proposed purchase price) and a one-way exchange ratio collar in which KCS stockholders would receive a fixed dollar amount of
stock consideration in the event the acquirer’s stock price fell below a specified threshold, up to a maximum number of shares.
On March 5, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer had a discussion with Mr. Creel regarding the key issues in the draft merger agreement received from KCS the prior
day, including with respect to the transaction structure and regulatory termination fee size and structure as proposed in KCS’s draft, as well as the one-
way exchange ratio collar.
On March 6, 2021, the KCS board convened a meeting to discuss the updated proposals submitted by CPRL and Party A. Mr. Ottensmeyer reviewed the
terms of each proposal and again expressed his views on the strategic options available to the Company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA
Securities also shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the proposals. The directors discussed with members of management and
representatives of the financial advisors the potential synergies from a transaction involving CPRL and the possible benefits and risks associated with
accepting merger consideration that included an acquirer’s common stock. Among other things, the KCS board discussed various mechanisms to protect
against a potential decline in an acquirer’s stock price, including the one-way exchange ratio collar proposed in the draft merger agreement provided to
CPRL. The KCS board discussed again with the Company’s legal advisors the regulatory uncertainties and timeline for a strategic combination. The KCS
board then directed management and the financial advisors to ask Party A and CPRL to submit final proposals and merger agreement markups by no later
than March 15, and to inform Party A that it could reach out to its lending sources to confirm financing. The KCS board also again considered whether or
not to reach out to other parties. After considering, among other factors, the various risks associated with further opening up the process, and the
“fiduciary out” provisions included in the proposed merger agreement, the KCS board determined to focus its efforts on negotiating a transaction with
either Party A or CPRL and not to reach out to other potential counterparties at the time.
Following the KCS board meeting, representatives of KCS and their advisors sent a letter to representatives of each of Party A and CPRL outlining the
process and request for final proposals. In addition, representatives of KCS sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Party A. Similar to the
draft merger agreement provided to CPRL, the draft merger agreement contemplated a customary “fiduciary out” provision that would permit the
55
Table of Contents
KCS board to terminate its existing agreement with an acquirer in order to accept an alternative acquisition proposal under certain circumstances. It also
included a reverse termination fee representing 7.0% of the transaction consideration (or approximately $1.6 billion based on Party A’s then proposed
purchase price) in the event the transaction did not close due to the failure to obtain financing.
On March 9, 2021, the finance committee of the KCS board held a meeting for the purpose of further analyzing and discussing the possible benefits and
risks associated with accepting merger consideration that included an acquirer’s common stock. At the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley and
BofA Securities reviewed the mechanics of the one-way exchange ratio collar proposed in the draft merger agreement provided to CPRL and a range of
other mechanisms that could be used to protect against a potential decline in an acquirer’s stock price, together with a summary of the frequency with
which such mechanisms had been employed or not employed in recent M&A transactions.
On March 10, 2021, KCS and CPRL executed a clean team agreement to facilitate the sharing of certain sensitive diligence materials. Also on March 10,
2021, representatives of the CPRL management team held a reverse due diligence call with representatives of KCS.
On March 11, 2021, Wachtell Lipton sent to Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, CPRL’s outside counsel (“Sullivan & Cromwell”), an initial draft of the KCS
disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.
On March 15, 2021, Party A and CPRL submitted revised acquisition proposals, including markups of the forms of merger agreement previously provided
by KCS. Party A’s proposal contemplated an all-cash purchase price of $250.00 per share, which it noted was its “final proposal.” The proposal indicated
that Party A’s lenders had received full credit committee approvals to increase the overall debt financing to $10.3 billion and that all but one of Party A’s
equity partners had received the required internal approvals to fund the transaction (Party A informed KCS subsequently that this final approval had
been obtained). CPRL’s proposal contemplated merger consideration of 0.489 of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 CPRL common shares after
giving effect to the share split), without any provision for a collar, and $86.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately $268.00 per
share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time). CPRL’s proposal also contemplated, among other things, an
increased $800.0 million reverse termination fee and the elimination of the right of the KCS board to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a
superior proposal in certain circumstances.
On March 16, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS’s
legal advisors, to review the proposals received from Party A and CPRL. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities reviewed the history of
KCS’s discussions with Party A and with CPRL, including the financial terms of the proposals that each party had submitted since August 2020.
Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also provided an overview of the merger agreement markups delivered by Party A and CPRL. The KCS board entered
into a discussion with members of management and representatives of the Company’s financial advisors regarding Party A’s proposed financing structure
and its potential capacity to further increase its purchase price. It was the view of the KCS board based on this discussion, as well as Party A’s statement
that it had made its “final proposal”, that Party A would have minimal room to further increase its offer. The KCS board considered these facts and
perspectives, as well as the facts and perspectives previously discussed and reviewed at prior meetings, and determined to focus its efforts on
negotiating a transaction with CPRL, subject to CPRL agreeing to specific improvements to the terms of its proposal. To that end, the KCS board directed
Mr. Ottensmeyer to communicate to Mr. Creel that the KCS board would be willing to proceed with a transaction if CPRL were to improve its proposal by,
among other things, increasing its contemplated exchange ratio from 0.489 to 0.5 of a CPRL common share, increasing the amount of the reverse
termination fee from $800.0 million to $1.3 billion, and accepting the KCS board’s right to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal in certain circumstances. A member of management and representatives of KCS’s outside compensation advisor also reviewed the terms of a
proposed retention

program and severance arrangements proposed to be submitted for approval by the KCS board were it to approve a transaction with CPRL. The KCS
board discussed the terms of and reasons for the proposed retention program and severance arrangements.
Later that day, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Creel to communicate the KCS board’s requests. Mr. Creel said that he would need to consult with members of
Later that day, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Creel to communicate the KCS board’s requests. Mr. Creel said that he would need to consult with members of
the CPRL board. Mr. Creel subsequently responded by stating that CPRL was prepared to offer an increased merger consideration of $90 in cash and 0.489
of a CPRL common share (equivalent to 2.445 shares after giving effect to the share split) for each share of KCS common stock (equal to approximately
$272 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CPRL common shares at the time), to increase the reverse termination fee to $1 billion,
and to agree to the right of the KCS board to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal from a third party in certain circumstances.
The following day, CPRL submitted a revised written proposal reflecting these terms. Mr. Ottensmeyer informed the KCS board of the terms of CPRL’s
proposal, and at the direction of the KCS board and management, representatives of Wachtell Lipton proceeded to negotiate final terms of the transaction
documents with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, with the goal of announcing a signed merger agreement no later than the morning of March 21,
2021. From March 17 through March 20, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell exchanged further revised drafts of the merger
agreement and participated in calls to resolve the remaining open issues.
On March 20, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities
and KCS’s legal advisors. A representative of Wachtell Lipton again discussed with the board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Thereafter,
representatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each financial advisor rendered to the
KCS board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set
forth in each financial advisor’s respective written opinion, the consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of KCS common stock (other
than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Wachtell Lipton
representative then summarized the terms of the merger agreement compared to the terms previously reviewed. After further discussion and deliberation,
the KCS board unanimously approved the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of KCS adopt the merger agreement. The
KCS board also approved the proposed retention and severance arrangements previously discussed.
Following the completion of the KCS board meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell finalized the merger agreement, and in
the early morning of March 21, 2021, KCS and CPRL executed the prior CP merger agreement. KCS and CPRL issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction in the morning of March 21, 2021.
On March 22, 2021, representatives of CPRL submitted a letter to STB Staff requesting an informal opinion that CPRL’s proposed voting trust agreement
comported with the standards set forth in 49 C.F.R. § 1013.3(a).
On April 20, 2021, KCS received an unsolicited written proposal from CN (the “CN proposal”) to acquire KCS for 1.059 common shares of CN and $200.00
in cash per share of KCS common stock (valued at $325.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of CN common shares at the time).
The proposal contemplated that CN and KCS would enter into a merger agreement with substantially similar terms to those of the prior CP merger
agreement, including the use of a voting trust arrangement and a commitment to obtain regulatory approvals on the same terms as in the prior CP merger
agreement.
The KCS board met on April 20, 2021, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS’s
legal advisors, for a preliminary review of the CN proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities reviewed and discussed their
preliminary perspectives
57
Table of Contents
on the financial terms of the CN proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board also reviewed potential
synergy estimates for a combination with CN relative to the synergies estimated for the transaction with CPRL.
On April 23, 2021, the STB announced a decision that the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b) applied to the proposed transaction between CPRL
and KCS and stated that the agency’s review of the transaction would be governed by the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. part 1180 (2000).
On April 24, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities
and KCS’s legal advisors. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities again shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the CN
proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board reviewed the potential synergies for a combination with
each of CPRL and CN and discussed with the advisors the likely capacity of each party to further increase its purchase price and other enhancements that
could be requested of CPRL and CN with respect to the terms of a transaction. The KCS board also discussed the regulatory considerations and issues
relating to a combination with CN relative to CPRL, including an assessment of the process for approval of the proposed voting trust and for obtaining
final regulatory approval for the potential combination. After consideration of these facts and perspectives, as well as the facts and perspectives
previously discussed and reviewed at the KCS board’s April 20th meeting, the KCS board determined that the CN proposal could reasonably be expected
to lead to a “Company Superior Proposal”, as defined in the prior CP merger agreement (which we refer to as a “company superior proposal”).
Accordingly, the KCS board determined that KCS should provide information to CN, and engage in discussions and negotiations with CN, with respect
to the CN proposal. KCS management subsequently notified representatives of CN and CPRL of the KCS board’s determination, after which KCS issued a
press release announcing its decision and intent to engage in discussions with CN. On the evening of April 24, 2021, representatives of Cravath, Swaine
& Moore LLP (which we refer to as “Cravath”), CN’s outside counsel, sent to Wachtell Lipton proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust
agreement reflecting the terms described in the CN proposal.
On April 26, 2021, representatives of CN submitted an application to the STB requesting approval of CN’s proposed voting trust agreement, pursuant to
49 C.F.R. § 1180.4(b)(4)(iv) (and not under the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b)). Also on April 26, 2021, KCS entered into a confidentiality
agreement and clean team agreement with CN in substantially the same forms as the confidentiality agreements entered into with CPRL and Party A, other
than the absence of standstill provisions and other immaterial changes. Through the subsequent weeks, KCS provided CN with access to a virtual data
room and various business and legal due diligence materials, including a copy of the KCS long-range plan. Representatives of CN participated in
management presentations and diligence sessions hosted by KCS. In addition, CN provided KCS with access to a virtual data room and various reverse
diligence materials.
On May 6, 2021, the STB announced a decision finding that the voting trust agreement proposed by CPRL was acceptable, subject to certain
modifications.
On May 8, 2021, the KCS board convened a meeting with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and
KCS’s legal advisors to discuss KCS’s ongoing engagement with CN and potential next steps. Members of management and representatives of Wachtell
Lipton reviewed the terms of CN’s draft merger agreement and presented a proposed list of enhancements to request from CN with respect to the CN
proposal, including (1) increasing the exchange ratio from 1.059 shares so that the transaction could qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, (2) increasing the reverse termination fee payable to KCS in the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the
inability of the parties to complete the voting trust transaction as a result of STB regulatory issues from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion, (3) requiring CN to
reimburse KCS upon payment of the $700.0 million termination fee by KCS to CPRL in the event KCS terminated the prior CP merger agreement to enter
into a merger agreement with CN and (4) enhancing the flexibility of KCS to undertake certain actions following the execution of a merger agreement with
CN without CN’s prior written consent, including with respect to the terms of KCS’s retention program and
58
Table of Contents
severance arrangements. The KCS board also reviewed a proposed timeline for soliciting a revised proposal from CN. The KCS board then directed
management, together with KCS’s legal advisors, to seek the enhancements to the CN proposal discussed with the KCS board and to request that CN
submit a revised binding proposal so that the KCS board could be in a position to make a determination as to whether such revised proposal constituted
a company superior proposal at a meeting scheduled for May 13, 2021. The KCS board also directed management to notify CPRL of the KCS board’s
intention to make a determination with respect to the CN proposal at its next meeting and to suggest that CPRL submit any revisions with respect to the
prior CP merger agreement before such time.
Following the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer communicated the KCS board’s requests to Mr. Ruest and to Mr. Creel. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also
reached out to Cravath to review the requested enhancements with respect to the CN proposal.
On May 11, 2021, representatives of Cravath contacted Wachtell Lipton to convey CN’s responses to KCS’s requested enhancements. The
representatives of Cravath expressed that CN was prepared to accept several of KCS’s requests for enhanced flexibility during the pendency of the
transaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS’s retention program and severance arrangements. The representatives of Cravath also expressed
that CN was prepared to accept KCS’s proposal that CN (or an affiliate of CN) reimburse KCS for the $700.0 million termination fee that would be payable
by KCS to CPRL in connection with the termination of the prior CP merger agreement, subject to KCS refunding such reimbursement in the event (i) KCS
terminated the merger agreement with CN in order to accept a superior proposal, (ii) CN terminated the merger agreement upon a change of
recommendation by the KCS board, (iii) CN terminated the merger agreement on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties or
covenants in a manner that would entitle CN not to consummate the merger or (iv) CN terminated the merger agreement on the basis of the occurrence of
a material adverse effect on the business and operations of KCS. The Cravath representatives indicated that CN was unwilling to increase the exchange
ratio or the reverse termination fee.
On May 12, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer called Mr. Ruest to request that CN increase its exchange ratio so as to restore the $325.00 per share valuation of the
CN proposal based on the current market price of CN common shares. Mr. Ottensmeyer further requested that CN consider increasing the amount of the
reverse termination fee payable to KCS in the event the merger agreement was terminated due to the inability of the parties to complete the voting trust
transaction as a result of STB regulatory issues. Mr. Ottensmeyer also spoke with Mr. Creel and encouraged CPRL to submit any proposed revisions to
the prior CP merger agreement before the KCS board’s next meeting.
On the morning of May 13, 2021, representatives of Cravath sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a proposed form of offer letter and revised drafts
of the merger agreement and other transaction documents. CN’s revised proposal contemplated an increase in the exchange ratio to 1.129 shares of CN
common shares while maintaining the $200.00 per share cash component of the proposed consideration (restoring the $325.00 per share valuation of the
CN proposal based on the closing price of CN common shares on May 12, 2021), an obligation by an affiliate of CN to reimburse KCS for the $700.0
million termination fee payable to CPRL (subject to KCS refunding such reimbursement in the event (i) KCS terminated the merger agreement with CN in
order to accept a superior proposal, (ii) CN terminated the merger agreement upon a change of recommendation by the KCS board or (iii) CN terminated
the merger agreement on the basis of a breach by KCS of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would entitle CN not to
consummate the merger), and enhanced flexibility on the part of KCS to undertake certain actions without CN’s prior written consent during the pendency
of the transaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS’s retention program and severance arrangements. Through the morning and early
afternoon, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Cravath discussed various minor revisions to the transaction documents. Representatives of Cravath
then submitted a binding offer letter on behalf of CN, together with proposed final and binding forms of merger agreement and schedules (collectively, the
“revised CN proposal”). The offer letter indicated that the revised CN proposal could be accepted by KCS at any time prior to 5:00 pm Eastern Time on
May 21, 2021.

On the afternoon of May 13, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA
Securities and KCS’s legal advisors, to discuss the revised CN proposal. The KCS board reviewed the terms of the revised CN proposal relative to the
terms of the prior CP merger agreement and discussed various regulatory considerations relating to a combination with CN and with CPRL, including the
STB’s decision to apply the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b) to the potential CPRL transaction and CPRL’s receipt of STB voting trust
approval. The KCS board discussed potential next steps and the requirements of the prior CP merger agreement with respect to any further engagement
with CN. Among other things, the KCS board considered the fact that, in the event the KCS board determined that the revised CN proposal constituted a
company superior proposal, KCS would be required to provide CPRL the opportunity for at least five business days to attempt to match the terms of the
revised CN proposal prior to terminating the prior CP merger agreement and entering into a definitive agreement with CN. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley and BofA Securities also provided to the KCS board their respective financial analyses. The representatives stated that they had each reviewed
the terms of the revised CN proposal with their respective fairness committees and that, absent any material developments following the conclusion of
the meeting, the financial advisors stood ready to deliver customary fairness opinions with respect to the revised CN proposal at such time as the KCS
board were to consider terminating the prior CP merger agreement and entering into a merger agreement in relation to the revised CN proposal. The KCS
board determined that the revised CN proposal constituted a company superior proposal and directed management to notify CPRL of the KCS board’s
intention to terminate the prior CP merger agreement and to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the revised CN proposal unless, at the end of
the five business day period following the notice, the KCS board determined that the revised CN proposal no longer constituted a company superior
proposal. Members of KCS management communicated the KCS board’s determination to representatives of CN and CPRL after the end of the meeting,
and later on the evening of May 13, 2021, KCS issued a press release announcing the KCS board’s determination.
On May 17, 2021, the STB announced a decision finding that application of the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b) to a potential transaction
between CN and KCS was not warranted and stated that the agency’s review of the transaction would be governed by the regulations set forth at 49
C.F.R. part 1180, as adopted in Major Rail Consolidation Procedures, 5 S.T.B. 539 (2001). The STB also denied CN’s motion to approve its proposed voting
trust agreement as incomplete, without prejudice to filing a new motion.
On the morning of May 20, 2021, Mr. Creel contacted Mr. Ottensmeyer to notify him that CPRL did not intend to propose revisions to the prior CP merger
agreement, explaining that, in CPRL’s view, it would be destructive to CPRL’s and KCS’s mutual interests to engage in a bidding war with CN. Shortly
thereafter, Mr. Creel publicly announced CPRL’s intention not to increase its offer. Later that afternoon, the KCS board convened a meeting to discuss
next steps with respect to the revised CN proposal. The KCS board reviewed again with KCS’s financial and legal advisors the financial terms of the
revised CN proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the prior CP merger agreement. The KCS board also discussed the regulatory considerations
associated with pursuing a transaction with CN and CPRL, including the STB’s determinations with respect to CN’s and CPRL’s proposed voting trust
agreements, and considered the possibility of seeking additional enhancements to CN’s proposal. The KCS board then directed management to reach out
to CN to request a further increase in the exchange ratio so as to restore the $325.00 per share valuation of the CN proposal based on the current market
price of CN common shares and a revised “escalating” reverse termination fee that would increase by $100.0 million per month in the event CN were
unable to obtain STB voting trust approval within three months of the execution of a merger agreement with KCS.
Following the meeting, Mr. Ottensmeyer contacted Mr. Ruest to convey the requests from the KCS board. Later that evening, Mr. Ruest reached out to
Mr. Ottensmeyer to indicate that CN was not willing to make any further changes to the revised CN proposal.
On the morning of May 21, 2021, the KCS board met again. Mr. Ottensmeyer updated the KCS board as to his conversations with Mr. Ruest, after which a
discussion followed among the directors as to potential next steps. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the board its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law. Thereafter,
60

representatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each financial advisor rendered to the
KCS board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set
forth in each financial advisor’s respective written opinion, the consideration to be received in the transaction with CN by holders of KCS common stock
(other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After further discussion
and deliberation, the KCS board unanimously determined that the revised CN proposal continued to constitute a company superior proposal and
approved the termination of the prior CP merger agreement, KCS’s payment of the $700.0 million CP termination payment to CPRL pursuant to the terms of
the prior CP merger agreement and KCS’s entry into the merger agreement with CN. The KCS board also approved the updated retention and severance
arrangements set forth in the revised CN proposal.
Following the completion of the KCS board meeting, KCS management notified CPRL of the KCS board’s determination, after which KCS terminated the
prior CP merger agreement and paid the $700.0 million CP termination payment to CPRL. Shortly thereafter, KCS delivered an executed signature page to
the CN agreement, which had already been executed by CN, and KCS and CN issued a joint press release announcing the transaction. Following
execution of the CN agreement, an affiliate of CN reimbursed KCS for the $700.0 million CP termination payment paid to CPRL.
On May 26, 2021, representatives of KCS and CN jointly filed with the STB a renewed motion for approval of CN’s proposed voting trust agreement. The
motion included, among other things, a commitment by CN to divest KCS’s 70-mile line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge following the
consummation of a transaction and STB final approval.
On June 8, 2021, the STB issued a timetable for reviewing CN’s proposed voting trust agreement. The STB directed KCS and CN to file certain additional
materials relating to the financial condition of CN with the STB by June 14, 2021 and requested public comments on CN’s proposed voting trust on June
28, 2021 and KCS’s and CN’s replies on July 6, 2021.
On June 22, 2021, CN filed with the SEC a preliminary Form F-4 registration statement with respect to the CN common shares issuable in the proposed
merger with KCS. The registration statement included a preliminary proxy statement of KCS relating to the KCS stockholder meeting proposed to be
convened to vote on the CN merger (the “KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting”).
On July 2, 2021, KCS fixed and announced August 19, 2021 as the date for the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.
On July 7, 2021, CN filed with the SEC a final prospectus with respect to the CN common shares issuable in the proposed merger with KCS and KCS filed
a definitive proxy statement with respect to KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.
On July 29, 2021, CPRL filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of votes against the CN merger at the KCS-CN
merger approval stockholder meeting. On August 9, 2021, CPRL filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of votes
against the CN merger at the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.
On the morning of August 10, 2021, KCS received an unsolicited written proposal from CPRL (the “revised CPRL proposal”) to acquire KCS for 2.884
CPRL common shares and $90.00 in cash per share of KCS common stock (valued at $300.00 per share of KCS common stock based on the market price of
CPRL common shares at the time). The revised CPRL proposal contemplated that CPRL and KCS would enter into a merger agreement with substantially
similar terms to those of the CN agreement and included proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust agreement. The revised CPRL proposal
indicated that, in connection with KCS’s termination of the CN agreement, CPRL would remit $1.4 billion to KCS to reimburse KCS for the payment of
61
Table of Contents
the $700.0 million termination payment that would be due to CN and the $700.0 million refund that would be due to an affiliate of CN with respect to the
CN affiliate’s reimbursement of the CP termination payment previously paid by KCS to CPRL. The revised CPRL proposal contemplated that KCS would
be required to refund the full amount of the reimbursement in connection with the termination of a merger agreement under specified circumstances. In the
afternoon of August 10, 2021, the STB announced that it expected to issue a decision on CN’s proposed voting trust no later than August 31, 2021. The
KCS board convened a meeting on the same day, together with members of senior management and representatives of KCS’s legal advisors for a
preliminary review of the revised CPRL proposal and to discuss the STB’s announcement and potential next steps. The KCS board instructed Mr.
Ottensmeyer to reach out to Mr. Ruest to inquire as to whether CN would be willing to increase its purchase price or otherwise improve the terms of its
proposed merger in light of the receipt of the revised CPRL proposal and the STB’s recent announcement.
On August 11, 2021, Mr. Ottensmeyer contacted Mr. Ruest to communicate the KCS board’s inquiry. Later that day, Mr. Ruest indicated that CN was not
prepared to increase its proposed purchase price or otherwise modify the terms of the proposed transaction, but that CN would support a decision by the
KCS board (if the KCS board so decided) to adjourn the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting to take place after the STB’s announcement of a
final ruling on the CN voting trust.
On August 12, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities
and KCS’s legal advisors. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities shared their perspectives on the financial terms of the revised CPRL
proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the CN agreement. The KCS board reviewed the potential synergies for a combination with each of CN
and CPRL and discussed with management and the advisors the potential capacity of each party to further enhance the terms of a transaction, including
the feedback Mr. Ottensmeyer had received from Mr. Ruest regarding CN’s unwillingness to improve the terms of its proposal. The KCS board also
discussed the feedback received from investors and the potential paths available to KCS and reviewed again the regulatory considerations and issues
relating to a combination with CPRL relative to CN. The KCS board then determined that the revised CPRL proposal did not constitute, and could not
reasonably be expected to lead to, a “Company Superior Proposal”, as defined in the CN agreement (which, for purposes of the remainder of this section
of this proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to as a “company superior proposal”). The KCS board also determined to adjourn the KCS-CN merger
approval stockholder meeting in the event the STB did not release a public decision on the CN voting trust by August 17, 2021, at 6:00 p.m., Central Time.
Shortly thereafter, KCS issued a press release announcing its decision. Because the STB had not yet released its decision on the CN voting trust, on
August 19, 2021, KCS convened and adjourned the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting until September 3, 2021.
On August 31, 2021, the STB announced a unanimous decision rejecting the use of a voting trust agreement in connection with the proposed transaction
between KCS and CN. Later that day, Mr. Creel called Mr. Ottensmeyer to renew and reaffirm the terms of the revised CPRL proposal, which Mr. Creel
conveyed in writing to Mr. Ottensmeyer shortly after the conclusion of their call, together with proposed forms of a merger agreement and a voting trust
agreement. The letter indicated that the revised CPRL proposal would expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 12, 2021, if KCS did not deliver
evidence to CPRL by that time that KCS had delivered to CN notice of its intention to terminate the CN agreement and enter into a merger agreement with
CPRL. At 8:00 p.m., Eastern Time, the KCS board convened a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA
Securities and KCS’s legal advisors, to discuss the developments of the day. After deliberation, in light of these developments, the KCS board determined
to further adjourn the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting.
On September 3, 2021, KCS convened and adjourned the KCS-CN merger approval stockholder meeting until September 24, 2021.
On the morning of September 4, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley, BofA Securities and KCS’s legal advisors, to discuss the
62
Table of Contents
revised CPRL proposal and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities again provided their perspectives on the
financial terms of the revised CPRL proposal in comparison to the financial terms of the CN agreement. The KCS board reviewed an illustrative expected
value comparison with respect to the CN and CPRL offers weighted, respectively, by a range of probabilities of consummating a voting trust transaction
in connection with each offer. Mr. Ottensmeyer also informed the KCS board that Mr. Ruest had indicated that CN would be willing to join KCS in an
appeal of the STB ruling denying approval of the CN voting trust, and would be willing to explore the possibility of pursuing a combination of KCS and
CN without a voting trust, but that CN would not be willing to increase the merger consideration or the reverse termination fee that would be payable to
KCS if regulatory approval were not obtained.
The KCS board then discussed a proposed list of potential enhancements to request from CN and CPRL. These included, with respect to CN, requests to
appeal the STB decision and increase the proposed purchase price and reverse termination fee due to KCS (notwithstanding Mr. Ruest’s statements to
Mr. Ottensmeyer), and with respect to CPRL, requests to increase the proposed purchase price, reduce the amount of the reimbursement that would be
refundable by KCS under certain circumstances from $1.4 billion to $700.0 million, permit KCS to pay a one-time special dividend to KCS stockholders
prior to closing, revise the contemplated transaction structure so that the transaction could qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code (as was contemplated in the prior CP merger agreement) and enhance the flexibility of KCS to undertake certain actions following the
execution of a merger agreement with CPRL without CPRL’s prior written consent (such as with respect to the terms of KCS’s retention program and
severance arrangements). The KCS board also reviewed a proposed timeline for soliciting revised proposals from CN and CPRL. After consideration of
these perspectives, together with analysis of the STB’s ruling on the CN voting trust and the other events of the week, the KCS board determined that
the revised CPRL proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a company superior proposal. Accordingly, the KCS board determined that KCS
should provide information to CPRL, and engage in discussions and negotiations with CPRL, with respect to the revised CPRL proposal. The KCS board
then directed management, together with KCS’s legal advisors, to seek from CN and CPRL the enhancements discussed with the KCS board. KCS
management subsequently notified representatives of CN and CPRL of the KCS board’s determination, after which KCS issued a press release
announcing its decision and intent to engage in discussions with CPRL.
Over the following week, KCS provided CPRL with renewed access to a virtual data room and various business and legal due diligence materials,
including a copy of the KCS long-range plan, and responded to diligence requests and questions from CPRL. In addition, CPRL provided KCS with
renewed access to a virtual data room and various reverse diligence materials, including a copy of CPRL’s internal five-year financial forecast (the “CPRL
five-year plan”). Additionally, during this time, members of KCS management and representatives of KCS’s legal advisors discussed with their
counterparts at CN and CPRL the proposed enhancements sought by the KCS board with respect to their respective proposals. On September 5, 2021,
representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting these requested
enhancements.
On September 6, 2021, Mr. Creel reached out to Mr. Ottensmeyer to express that CPRL was prepared to reduce the amount of the reimbursement that
would be refundable by KCS under certain circumstances from $1.4 billion to $700.0 million, revise the contemplated transaction structure so that the
transaction could qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and accept several of KCS’s requests for enhanced
flexibility during the pendency of the transaction, including with respect to the terms of KCS’s retention program and severance arrangements. Mr. Creel
indicated that CPRL was unwilling to accept KCS’s other requests, including the request for any additional merger consideration and the ability to pay a
one-time special dividend to KCS stockholders. On the next day, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton
revised drafts of the transaction documents reflecting the positions communicated by Mr. Creel. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan &
Cromwell subsequently discussed various minor revisions to the transaction documents.

On September 9, 2021, Mr. Ruest reiterated CN’s position that CN would be willing to pursue an appeal of the STB ruling and to explore the possibility of
pursuing a combination of KCS and CN without a voting trust, but that CN would not be willing to increase its merger consideration or reverse
termination fee.
On the night of September 11, 2021, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a binding offer letter, dated
September 12, 2021, and final forms of merger agreement and other transaction documents (collectively, the “final CPRL proposal”). The binding offer
letter indicated that the final CPRL proposal could be accepted at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 20, 2021, assuming that the KCS
board determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal and KCS delivered to CN, no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on September 12, 2021, notice of KCS’s intention to terminate the CN agreement and enter into a merger agreement with CPRL.
On the morning of September 12, 2021, the KCS board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA
Securities and KCS’s legal advisors, to discuss the final CPRL proposal. The KCS board reviewed the terms of the final CPRL proposal relative to the
terms of the CN agreement and discussed potential next steps and the requirements of the CN agreement with respect to any further engagement with
CPRL, including the obligation of KCS to provide CN the opportunity for at least five business days to attempt to match the terms of the final CPRL
proposal in the event the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley and BofA Securities also provided to the KCS board their respective financial analyses. The representatives stated that they had each reviewed
the terms of the final CPRL proposal with their respective fairness committees and that, absent any material developments following the conclusion of the
meeting, the financial advisors stood ready to deliver customary fairness opinions with respect to the final CPRL proposal at such time as the KCS board
were to consider terminating the CN agreement and accept the final CPRL proposal.
Following these presentations and discussions, the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal constituted a company superior proposal and
directed management to notify CN of the KCS board’s intention to terminate the CN agreement and to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the
final CPRL proposal unless, at the end of the five business day period following the notice, the KCS board determined that the final CPRL proposal no
longer constituted a company superior proposal. After the end of the meeting, members of KCS management communicated the KCS board’s
determination to representatives of CN and CPRL and KCS issued a press release announcing the KCS board’s determination.
On September 13, 2021, members of KCS and CN management and representatives of their respective legal advisors began discussing the possibility of
entering into a waiver letter agreement pursuant to which CN would agree to waive the five business day match period under the CN agreement.
Representatives of CN reiterated the position that CN was unwilling to offer any additional merger consideration or increase the amount of the reverse
termination fee contemplated by CN’s proposed transaction with KCS. On September 14, 2021, representatives of CN communicated to KCS that CN was
prepared to enter into the waiver letter agreement. Shortly thereafter, representatives of KCS notified CPRL of CN’s intention to waive the five business
day match period under the CN agreement and that, as such, the KCS board would convene a meeting the next morning to make a final determination as
to whether or not to terminate the CN agreement and accept the final CPRL proposal.
On the morning of September 15, 2021, the KCS board held a meeting. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the board its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law. Thereafter, representatives of each of the financial advisors presented to the KCS board their respective financial analyses and each
financial advisor rendered to the KCS board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the
effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by such financial advisor, as set forth in such financial advisor’s written opinion, the consideration to
be received by holders of KCS common stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the transaction with CPRL was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities is attached to this
proxy statement as Annexes B and C, respectively, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also the sections entitled
64
Table of Contents
“The KCS Merger Proposal—Opinion of Morgan Stanley” and “The KCS Merger Proposal—Opinion of BofA Securities” on pages 72 and 85,
respectively. After further discussion and deliberation, the KCS board unanimously determined that the final CPRL proposal continued to constitute a
company superior proposal and approved the proposed waiver letter agreement with CN, termination of the CN merger agreement, KCS’s payment of the
$700.0 million CN agreement termination payment and the $700.0 million CN refund owed to CN (or its affiliates) under the terms of the CN agreement, and
KCS’s entry into the merger agreement with CPRL. The KCS board also approved the updated retention and severance arrangements set forth in the final
CPRL proposal.
Following the completion of the KCS board meeting, KCS management notified CN of the KCS board’s determination, after which KCS and CN entered
into the waiver letter agreement and KCS terminated the CN agreement and paid the $700.0 million CN agreement termination payment. Shortly thereafter,
KCS delivered an executed signature page to the merger agreement with CPRL, which had already been executed by CPRL, and KCS and CPRL issued a
joint press release announcing the transaction. Following execution of the merger agreement, CPRL remitted to KCS $700.0 million in connection with the
payment of the CN agreement termination payment made by KCS to CN, KCS paid the $700.0 million CN refund to an affiliate of CN, and CPRL remitted to
KCS $700.0 million in connection with the payment of the CN refund made by KCS to an affiliate of CN.

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,Recommendation of the KCS Board; KCS’s Reasons for the Transaction,"Recommendation of the KCS Board; KCS’s Reasons for the Transaction
At a special meeting held on September 15, 2021, the KCS board unanimously: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of KCS and its stockholders,
and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement with CPRL; (2) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the merger); (3) recommended that the stockholders of KCS adopt the merger
agreement; and (4) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of KCS’s stockholders. The KCS board unanimously
recommends that KCS stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
In evaluating the transaction and in reaching its determinations and making its recommendations with respect to the merger agreement, the KCS board
consulted with KCS senior management and outside legal and financial advisors over the course of several meetings, and considered a number of factors,
including the following material factors that weighed in favor of the transaction.
Strategic Considerations and Synergies:
•
The KCS board believes the transaction will create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico and Canada, with the ability to deliver
dramatically expanded market reach for KCS and CPRL customers, provide new competitive transportation options, provide infrastructure,
public safety and environmental benefits through truck to rail conversion opportunities, and support North American economic growth;
•
The KCS board believes CPRL and KCS are the fastest growing Class 1 railroads, with significant success in the transformation to Precision
Scheduled Railroading;
•
The KCS board considered a synergy analysis (based on CPRL’s synergies analysis) showing annualized EBITDA synergies for the
combined company of approximately $990 million (plus $20 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies)
expected to be realized within the first three years after the transaction, primarily by executing the combined growth strategies of KCS and
CPRL with new efficiencies for customers and improved on-time performance under their respective PSR programs; the KCS board also
considered a more conservative synergy analysis
prepared by KCS management showing EBITDA synergies of approximately $377 million (plus
65Table of Contents
$23 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies) over three years, and assessed both synergy analyses in
making its decision, as further described in the section entitled “KCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”;
•
The KCS board believes that the combined company will have the scale, balance sheet strength, financial flexibility, and free cash flow to
fund future growth, and improved ability to access the capital markets on more favorable terms than available to KCS as an independent
company, which would allow the combined company to be more competitive in capturing strategic opportunities;
•
The KCS board received information from and had discussions with KCS’s management, in consultation with outside financial advisors,
regarding CPRL’s business, results of operations, financial and market position, KCS management’s expectations concerning the combined
company’s business and financial prospects, and historical and current trading prices of CPRL common shares;
Attractive Value and Mix of Consideration
•
The KCS board considered the aggregate value and nature of the consideration to be received in the transaction by KCS stockholders,
including:
•
that the merger consideration had an implied value per share of KCS common stock of $300, based on the closing price of CPRL
common shares on the NYSE as of August 9, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the date on which CPRL submitted the revised
CPRL proposal), which represented a premium of approximately 34% to KCS stockholders based on the unaffected closing price of
KCS common stock on March 19, 2021 (the last trading day before the KCS board’s approval of and the announcement of the prior CP
merger agreement);
•
that based on CPRL’s market price on September 13, 2021, approximately 69% of the merger consideration consists of CPRL common
shares, with the CPRL common shares to be issued to KCS common stockholders constituting approximately 28% of the outstanding
shares of CPRL common shares following the transaction, offering KCS common stockholders the opportunity for meaningful
ownership participation in the future earnings, dividends, synergies and growth of the combined company, a company which the KCS
board considers to be an attractive investment for the reasons discussed above in the section entitled “Strategic Considerations and
Synergies”;
•
that based on CPRL’s market price on September 13, 2021, approximately 31% of the merger consideration consists of cash, which
provides KCS stockholders with immediate liquidity for a portion of their shares; and
•
that the first merger and the second merger, taken together, are intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not apply to cause the mergers to result in gain recognition by holders
of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any Excepted
Shareholder), as more fully described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”;
Attractive Strategic Alternative:
•
The KCS board believes that the transaction with CPRL is attractive in comparison to the alternative of remaining independent and
continuing to execute on KCS’s long-range business strategy and is also attractive in comparison to other alternatives, including the CN
agreement. In this regard, the KCS board considered:
•
the course and history of KCS’s discussions and competitive negotiations with Party A and CN, including: (i) the fact that, after six
rounds of bidding, Party A’s last proposal to acquire KCS for
66
Table of Contents
$250.00 per share in cash was significantly lower in value than both CN’s and CPRL’s proposals and did not offer the opportunity for
ongoing participation in the combined company’s future performance; and (ii) the fact that CN determined that it was unwilling to
increase the consideration or otherwise enhance the transaction terms offered in its proposal to acquire KCS following the
announcement by the STB of its unanimous decision to reject CN’s proposed voting trust;
•
the fact that the STB had already approved the CPRL voting trust, and that the merger agreement, including the form of voting trust,
was substantially identical to the prior CP merger agreement but for the increase in the share consideration of the merger
consideration;
•
the confidence of CPRL in its ability to obtain approval for the full combination of CPRL and KCS as demonstrated by its willingness
to close into a voting trust, as more fully described below under “Terms of the Merger Agreement”;
•
the fact that, in the six months following public announcement of the prior CP merger agreement, no party other than CN had
submitted a competing proposal, and the fact that the merger agreement, like the CN agreement, would permit KCS to terminate the
merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions, were an unsolicited proposal to be made after
announcement of the transaction, as more fully described below under “Terms of the Merger Agreement”;
Opinions of KCS’s Financial Advisors
•
The KCS board considered the financial presentations by KCS’s financial advisors and the oral opinion of each such financial advisor
rendered to the KCS board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the effect that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, the procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
on the scope of the review undertaken by such financial advisor, as set forth in such financial advisor’s written opinion, the consideration
to be received by the holders of KCS common stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) in the
transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA
Securities is attached to this proxy statement as Annexes B and C, respectively, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in
its entirety. See also the sections entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Opinion of Morgan Stanley” and “The KCS Merger Proposal—
Opinion of BofA Securities” on pages 72 and 85, respectively;
Timing and Likelihood of Completion of the Transaction
•
The KCS board considered the willingness of CPRL to close into a voting trust, allowing KCS stockholders to receive the merger
consideration immediately following the completion of the voting trust transaction, which is currently expected to be completed by the first
quarter of 2022, rather than waiting for CPRL to obtain STB final approval from the STB before KCS stockholders would receive the merger
consideration;
•
The KCS board considered the limited closing conditions to the completion of the transaction, the absence of a financing condition or
similar contingency that is based on CPRL’s ability to obtain financing and the strong commitment made by CPRL to obtain regulatory
approvals, as further described in the section entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction”
on page 110 and “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Filings and Efforts; Other Actions” on page 160;
Terms of the Merger Agreement
•
The KCS board considered the ability of KCS, subject to specified limitations, to respond to and
67
Table of Contents
engage in discussions regarding unsolicited third-party acquisition proposals under certain circumstances and, ultimately, to terminate the
merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal to the merger with CPRL, subject to
compliance with the procedural terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and the payment of the $700.0 million CP termination
payment to CPRL and the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund, as further discussed in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement
—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement” on page 164;
•
The KCS board considered the terms of the merger agreement that restrict CPRL’s ability to solicit alternative business combination
transactions and to provide information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative business
combination transaction with CPRL, as further discussed in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No-Solicitation”;
•
The KCS board considered the obligation of CPRL to pay to KCS a termination payment of $1.0 billion upon termination of the merger
agreement under specified circumstances, including if (i) the transaction has not been consummated by February 21, 2022 (or, in the event
the authorizations required to be obtained from COFECE and the IFT with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
are the only outstanding conditions to be satisfied or waived as of February 21, 2022, by May 21, 2022) because there is an injunction or
similar order prohibiting the transaction or the voting trust transaction arising out of the STB review process or under Section 721 or (ii)
such an injunction or order has become final and non-appealable, in each case, as further discussed in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement” on page 164;
Governance Matters
•
The KCS board considered the fact that, following STB final approval (or at such earlier date following the closing of the transaction as may
be approved by the STB), four KCS directors will be appointed to the CPRL board, which will allow for oversight of and input into the
strategy of the combined company;
The KCS board weighed these factors that it viewed as supporting the merger agreement and the transaction against a number of potentially negative
factors, including:
•
the fact that completion of the transaction depends on certain factors outside of KCS’s control, including regulatory approvals and CPRL
shareholder approval, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied even if the merger proposal
is approved by KCS stockholders;
•
the potential consequences of non-consummation of the transaction, including the potential negative impacts on KCS, its business and the
trading price of its shares of common stock;
•
CPRL’s unwillingness to agree to adjustments in the fixed exchange ratio to protect against any decrease in the trading price of CPRL
common shares prior to the consummation of the transaction;
•
the terms of the merger agreement that restrict KCS’s ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals and to provide information to, or
engage in discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal, as further discussed in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation” on page 151, though the KCS board also considered that such terms do not prevent
such discussions if certain criteria are met;
•
the obligation of KCS to pay to CPRL the CP termination payment of $700.0 million upon termination of the merger agreement and to pay to
CPRL the $700.0 million CN termination amount refund in the event KCS accepts a superior proposal, though the KCS board determined that
the obligation was reasonable and not preclusive or coercive;
68
Table of Contents
•
the potential for diversion of management and employee attention, and potential retention challenges, due to the possible effects of the
announcement and pendency of the transaction, though the KCS board also considered and approved a retention program and severance
arrangements in connection with the transaction, as discussed in the sections entitled “Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Transaction—Executive Severance Arrangements” on page 103 and “Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Transaction—Retention Program” on page 105;
•
the difficulty and costs inherent in integrating large and diverse businesses;
•
the fact that forecasts of future results of operations and synergies are necessarily estimates based on assumptions, and that for these and
other reasons there is a risk of not realizing anticipated performance or capturing potential synergies and other benefits expected to be
obtained as a result of the transaction; and
•
the risks and other considerations of the type and nature described under the sections entitled “Risk Factors” on page 22 and “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 37.
The KCS board considered the factors described above as a whole, including through engaging in discussions with KCS senior management and KCS’s
outside legal and financial advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the KCS board unanimously concluded that these factors, on balance,
supported a determination that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the transaction, were
advisable and in the best interests of KCS stockholders, and to make its recommendation to KCS stockholders that they vote to adopt the merger
agreement.
In addition, the KCS board was aware of and considered the fact that KCS’s directors and executive officers may have certain interests in the transaction
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally, including the treatment of equity awards held by such directors and
executive officers in the transaction, as described in the section entitled “Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction” on page
102.
The foregoing discussion describes the material factors that the KCS board considered, but is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The KCS board
collectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger, in light of the various factors described above and other factors that the members of the KCS board believed appropriate. In view of
the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the KCS board considered in connection with its evaluation of the
transaction, the KCS board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights or values to any
of the factors it considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to
different factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the KCS board in approving the merger agreement is forward-looking in nature.
This information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
on page 37.

Board of Directors
All current members of the CPRL board will continue to serve as directors of the combined company. Under the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to
appoint four of the members of the KCS board to serve as directors on the CPRL board as of the control date, in each case until such director’s successor
is elected and qualified or the earlier of such director’s death, resignation or removal, in each case in accordance with CPRL’s constating documents. In
the event that after the effective time any of the four KCS directors selected to be part of the CPRL board upon the control date indicates that he or she
plans to resign as a director of KCS and is willing to become a director of CPRL, CPRL would need to seek the approval of the STB in order for such
director to be appointed prior to the control date.
69Table of Contents
Management
Following the effective time, the management and board of directors of KCS will continue to manage the second surviving corporation while its
outstanding shares of capital stock are held in the voting trust, pursuing its independent business plan and growth strategies. Following receipt of STB
final approval, CPRL (through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, merger holdco) will acquire control of KCS, the two companies will be combined and
Mr. Keith Creel, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of CPRL, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company as of the
control date. The other members of the executive management team of CPRL following the control date have not yet been determined, and will be
communicated in due course.

At its meeting held on September 11, 2021, after due consideration and extensive consultation with CPRL’s management and outside legal and financial
advisors to both CPRL and the CPRL board, the CPRL board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and authorized the issuance of CPRL common shares under the merger agreement. In doing so, the CPRL board considered the
business, assets and liabilities, results of operations, financial performance, strategic direction and prospects of CPRL and KCS, with a view to the best
interests of CPRL. In making its determination, the CPRL board considered a number of factors (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance) with a view to the best interests of CPRL, including the following:
•
the creation, as a result of the transaction, of the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico and Canada and the expected ability to
deliver significantly expanded market reach for customers served by CPRL and KCS and provide new competitive transportation service
options, including new single-line hauls across the combined company’s continent-wide network, while improving route efficiency and
reducing transit times; the expected benefits to CPRL’s business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, business plan and
prospects after CPRL’s combination with KCS following receipt of STB final approval, including the expected pro forma effect of the
transaction on the combined company;
•
the expectation that, after CPRL’s combination with KCS following receipt of STB final approval, a single integrated rail system will connect
premier ports on the U.S. Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coasts with key overseas markets, and that CPRL and KCS’s combined network will result
in increased efficiency and simplicity for the combined company’s customers, including grain, automotive, auto-parts, energy, intermodal
and other shippers;
•
the belief that CPRL’s and KCS’s cultures are aligned and rooted in the highest safety, service and performance standards and that CPRL
and KCS are both committed to improving sustainability and have made science-based pledges in-line with the Paris Agreement to improve
fuel efficiency and lower emissions in support of a more sustainable North American supply chain;
•
the expectation that the combination will create a more competitive network, while remaining the smallest of six U.S. Class 1 railroads by
revenue, and spur greater rail-to-rail competition and greater support for customers in growing their rail volumes;
•
CPRL management’s identification of approximately $1,000 million in annualized synergies (comprised of cost savings of $180 million and
$820 million in EBITDA growth from market opportunities) expected to be realized within the first three years after receipt of STB final
approval and the expectation that CPRL’s combination with KCS following receipt of STB final approval would be accretive to CPRL’s
adjusted diluted earnings per share;
•
the CPRL board’s knowledge of, and CPRL’s discussions with KCS management regarding, KCS’s business operations, financial condition,
earnings and prospects and its knowledge of CPRL’s business,
70Table of Contents
operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking into account KCS’s publicly filed information and the results of CPRL’s due
diligence investigation of KCS;
•
the expectation the combined company will benefit from the continued strong leadership of CPRL’s experienced President and Chief
Executive Officer and the addition of KCS’s seasoned management team will bring valuable expertise and talent to the operations of the
combined company;
•
the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of CPRL common shares or shares of KCS common
stock between the date of the merger agreement and the closing of the transaction;
•
the aggregate cash consideration is fixed, which gives CPRL additional certainty regarding the amount of cash required to be paid by CPRL
to consummate the transaction;
•
the belief, after a thorough review of other business combination and strategic opportunities reasonably available to CPRL, that the
transaction represents the most attractive opportunity for CPRL and that its review did not present a better alternative;
•
the ability of CPRL, in specified circumstances, to provide information to and to engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party
that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal, as further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement – No Solicitation,” on
page 151;
•
the ability of the CPRL board, in specified circumstances, to change its recommendation to CPRL shareholders concerning the transaction,
as further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Change of Recommendation,” on page 153;
•
other favorable terms of the merger agreement, including:
•
restrictions on KCS’s ability to solicit alternative business combination transactions and to provide confidential due diligence
information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative business combination transaction
with KCS, as further discussed in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation” on page 151;
•
the obligation of KCS to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million upon termination of the merger agreement under specified
circumstances and/or the CN termination amount refund of $700.0 million under specified circumstances; and
•
the requirement that KCS hold a stockholder vote on the adoption of the merger agreement, even though the KCS board may have
withdrawn or changed its recommendation; and
•
the probability that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied.
In connection with its deliberations relating to the transaction, the CPRL board also considered potential risks and negative factors concerning the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance), including the following:
•
the risk that the KCS stockholders may not approve the KCS merger proposal or that CPRL shareholders may not approve the issuance of
CPRL common shares to KCS common stockholders in connection with the transaction and the risk that the transaction might not be
completed in a timely manner or at all, despite CPRL’s efforts;
•
the effect that the length of time from announcement until closing could have on the market price of CPRL common shares, CPRL’s operating
results (particularly in light of the significant costs incurred in connection with the transaction) and the relationships with CPRL’s
employees, CPRL shareholders, customers, suppliers, regulators, partners and others that do business with CPRL;
•
the risk that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will not be realized in full or in part, including the risk that expected synergies will not
be achieved or will not be achieved in the expected time frame;
71
Table of Contents
•
the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve the transaction or may impose burdensome terms or conditions, giving rise to increased
pre-tax transaction costs, and the risk that divestitures or other accommodations required by antitrust regulatory authorities may decrease
or eliminate the anticipated strategic and other benefits of the transaction to CPRL;
•
the risk of diverting the attention of CPRL’s senior management from other strategic priorities to implement the transaction and make
arrangements for integration of CPRL’s and KCS’s operations and infrastructure following receipt of STB final approval;
•
certain restrictions on the conduct of CPRL’s business during the pendency of the transaction, including restrictions on CPRL’s ability to
solicit alternative business combination transactions, although the CPRL board believed that such restrictions were reasonable;
•
the requirement that CPRL hold a shareholder vote on the issuance of CPRL common shares in connection with the first merger, even
though the CPRL board may have withdrawn or changed its recommendation;
•
the obligation of CPRL to pay KCS a termination payment of (i) $1.0 billion upon termination of the merger agreement if certain regulatory
approvals are not obtained; or (ii) a termination payment of $700.0 million upon termination of the merger agreement under specified
circumstances;
•
the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event that the market price of CPRL common shares increases relative to the market
price of shares of KCS common stock between the date of the merger agreement and the closing of the transaction;
•
the potential impact on the market price of CPRL common shares as a result of the issuance of the share consideration to KCS common
stockholders;
•
the ownership dilution to pre-merger holders of CPRL common shares as a result of the issuance of CPRL common shares in connection with
the transaction;
•
the risks associated with the occurrence of events that may materially and adversely affect the financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, business or results of operations of KCS and/or its subsidiaries but not entitle CPRL to terminate the merger agreement; and
•
the risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” on page 21.
After consideration of these factors, the CPRL board determined that, overall, the potential benefits of the transaction outweighed the potential risks.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the CPRL board is not intended to be exhaustive and may not include all the factors considered by the
CPRL board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the transaction and the complexity of these matters, the
CPRL board did not attempt to quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors that it considered in reaching its
determination to approve the merger agreement. In addition, individual members of the CPRL board may have given differing weights to different factors.
The CPRL board conducted an overall review of the factors described above and other material factors, including through discussions with, and inquiry
of, CPRL’s management and outside legal and financial advisors.
The foregoing description of CPRL’s consideration of the factors supporting the transaction is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read

The KCS board retained Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor and to provide it with a financial opinion in connection with the transaction. KCS
selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan
72Table of Contents
Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the industry, business and affairs of KCS. At the meeting of the KCS board on
September 15, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 15, 2021, to the KCS
board to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to such holders of KCS common stock.
The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion to the KCS board, dated September 15, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in
rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The foregoing
summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Morgan
Stanley’s opinion and the summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion below carefully and in their entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was for the benefit of
the KCS board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion and did not
address any other aspects or implications of the transaction. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a
recommendation as to how the shareholders of KCS or CPRL should vote at the shareholder meetings to be held in connection with the transaction.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
(a)
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of KCS and CPRL, respectively;
(b)
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning KCS and CPRL, respectively;
(c)
reviewed the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, the KCS management assumed synergies and the KCS management unaudited
CPRL projections (each as defined and described in the below section entitled “KCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”), in each
case prepared by the management of KCS;
(d)
reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the transaction, prepared by the
managements of KCS and CPRL, respectively;
(e)
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of KCS, including information relating to certain
strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the transaction, with senior executives of KCS;

with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with KCS and CPRL, respectively, and their securities;
(i)
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
(j)
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of KCS and CPRL and certain parties and their financial and
legal advisors;
73
Table of Contents
(k)
reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated September 10, 2021 (the “draft agreement”), the debt commitment letters, the STB May 6
decision, the form of the voting trust agreement, and certain related documents; and
(l)
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by KCS and CPRL, respectively, and formed a substantial basis for
its opinion. With respect to the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and the KCS management assumed synergies, Morgan Stanley assumed
that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of KCS of the future
financial performance of KCS. With respect to the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of KCS of the future financial performance of CPRL,
including following consummation of the transaction. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the transaction will be consummated in accordance with
the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, (i) that the
transaction will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code, (ii) that CPRL will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in
the debt commitment letters, (iii) that the STB will permit the transaction to close into the voting trust in accordance with the terms of the STB May 6
decision and the voting trust agreement and (iv) that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft agreement.
Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for
the transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the transaction. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of KCS and
CPRL of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the transaction; (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of
KCS and CPRL; (iii) their ability to retain key employees of KCS and CPRL, respectively, and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, KCS and
CPRL’s existing and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory
advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of CPRL and KCS and their legal,
tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount
or nature of the compensation to any of KCS’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to KCS, nor does it
address the underlying business decision of KCS to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with any other transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the treatment of the KCS preferred stock, in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not
make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of KCS or CPRL, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Morgan Stanley as of, the date of its opinion. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with the preparation of its opinion to the KCS
board. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by
Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the
74
Table of Contents
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described
below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Morgan Stanley considered a number of
factors in analyzing the merger consideration. The fact that points in the ranges of implied equity value per share of KCS common stock derived below
were less than or greater than the merger consideration is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the merger
consideration, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent
that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before September 13, 2021 and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the KCS board, used and relied
upon the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, the KCS management assumed synergies and the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections.

Information” on page 96.
Analyses Related to KCS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value
of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per
share of KCS common stock as of June 30, 2021, based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the six months ending December 31, 2021 and
fiscal years 2022 through 2029 contained in the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, including net debt of KCS as of June 30, 2021 of $3,787
million. Morgan Stanley also calculated a range of terminal values for KCS based on next twelve months (“NTM”) EBITDA exit multiple range of 10.75x to
12.25x, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The estimated unlevered free cash flows and the range of
terminal values were then discounted to June 30, 2021 by applying a discount rate range of 6.1% to 7.3%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley’s
professional judgment and experience, to reflect KCS’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate range of 6.1% to
7.3% to reflect KCS’s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity)
by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together to determine the value. Cost of equity was calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (“CAPM”). The CAPM takes into account market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used an EBITDA
exit multiple range of 10.75x to 12.25x based on KCS’s and comparable companies’ EBITDA multiples over time.
This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock of $226.00 to $280.00, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common
stock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 and
the implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13, 2021 of
$288.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Comparable Public Company Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a comparable public company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and
75
Table of Contents
compared certain financial information of KCS with corresponding publicly available financial information for other Class 1 Rail companies that shared
certain similar characteristics to KCS to derive an implied valuation range for KCS. The companies used in this comparison were the following:
•
CPRL
•
CN
•
Union Pacific Corporation
•
Norfolk Southern Corporation
•
CSX Corporation
The above companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley’s knowledge of the industry and because they have businesses that may be considered
similar to KCS’s. Although none of such companies are identical or directly comparable to KCS, these companies are publicly traded companies with
operations and/or other criteria, such as lines of business, markets, business risks, growth prospects, maturity of business and size and scale of business,
that for purposes of its analysis Morgan Stanley considered similar to KCS.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the following statistics of each of these companies, based on public filings, publicly available
research estimates and publicly available financial information published by Capital IQ as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) for KCS and CPRL, as of April 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the CN proposal) for CN and as of September 13, 2021 for Union Pacific Corporation, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX
Corporation:
•
the ratio of aggregate value (“AV”), calculated as the market value of equity plus short-term debt, long-term debt, preferred equity and non-
controlling interests, net of cash, cash equivalents and investments to estimated fiscal year 2022 EBITDA (which is referred to below as the
“2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio”); and
•
the ratio of stock price to estimated fiscal year 2022 earnings per share (which is referred to below as the “2022E P/E Ratio”).
The results of Morgan Stanley’s analysis were presented for the comparable companies, as indicated in the following table:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio and 2022E P/E Ratio and applied these ranges to KCS’s estimated fiscal year
2022 EBITDA of $1,839 million based on consensus analyst estimates and of $1,827 million based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections,
and to KCS’s estimated fiscal year 2021 earnings per share of $10.50 based on consensus analyst estimates and of $10.75 based on the KCS management
unaudited KCS projections. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and

rounded to the nearest $1.00:

Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common
stock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 per
share and the implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13,
2021 of $288.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
No company included in the comparable public company analysis is identical to KCS. In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which
are beyond the control of KCS. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of KCS and the industry generally, industry
growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KCS and the industry, and in the financial markets in
general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Morgan Stanley used a 12.0x to 14.5x representative range for 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio for both KCS and CPRL. This range was based on market data
multiples for KCS, CPRL and the four other public Class 1 railroads (CN, Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation).
The KCS and CPRL market data were as of March 19, 2021 (the unaffected date for KCS’s share price), the CN market data was as of April 19, 2021 (the
unaffected date for CN’s share price), and the Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation market data were as of
September 13, 2021.

Precedent Transactions and Premia Paid Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which attempts to imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial terms
and premia of selected transactions. Morgan Stanley reviewed the publicly available financial information for certain transactions in the railroad industry
since June 1994.
For purposes of this analysis, based on publicly available financial information, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of the implied AV to last twelve
months EBITDA, referred to as the AV/LTM EBITDA Ratio, for each of the target companies in the selected transactions. The transactions reviewed, the
date that each transaction was announced and the corresponding AV/LTM EBITDA Ratios were as follows:

The selected precedent transactions varied significantly based upon company scale, business risks, growth prospects and geography, as well as
prevailing market trends. Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the precedent transactions and upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of AV/LTM EBITDA Ratio and applied this range to KCS’s last 12 months
(“LTM”) COVID-Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2021 of $1,600 million as provided by KCS management, which reflects an add-back of $128 million, as
provided by KCS management, for the estimated impact of COVID-19 for the third and the fourth quarters of 2020.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock as follows, in each case rounded to
the nearest $1.00:

Morgan Stanley also reviewed the premia paid for transactions announced between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2020 with a publicly announced
transaction value of more than $1,000 million, as published by Thomson Reuters. The premia paid were calculated based on each of (i) the target
company’s closing stock price and (ii) the 52-week high of the target company’s stock price, in each case on the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the transactions. Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley (A) selected a representative range of premia of 15% to 35% with respect to the target companies’ closing stock prices and applied this
range of premia to the closing trading price of KCS common stock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16 and (B) selected a representative range of premia of (5%) to 20% with respect to the 52-week highs
of such target companies’ stock prices and applied this range of premia to the 52-week high price per share of KCS common stock as of March 19, 2021
(which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16.
Morgan Stanley’s premia paid analysis was based on precedent transactions with transaction values greater than $1,000 million from 2007 to 2020. The
multiple range of 11.0x to 15.0x for the precedent transactions analysis was selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional experience and judgment.
These analyses indicated ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock of (i) $258.00 to $303.00 and (ii) $213.00 to $269.00, respectively,
in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock to the closing trading price of KCS common
stock as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $224.16, and
the implied value of the merger consideration to be received by holders of shares of KCS common stock in the transaction as of September 13, 2021 of
$288.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
No company or transaction used in the precedent transactions or premia paid analysis is identical to KCS or the transaction. In evaluating the precedent
transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KCS. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of
KCS or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of KCS or the
industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent transactions data.

Other Factors
Morgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced
for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
•
Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the low and high
per share trading range of shares of KCS common stock for the 12-month period ending March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior
to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). Morgan Stanley observed that during such period the trading
range was $101.00 to $224.00 per share of KCS common stock, rounded to the nearest $1.00.
•
Equity Research Analysts’ Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the
undiscounted price targets for shares of KCS common stock prepared and published by 20 equity research analysts as of March 19, 2021
(which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). These targets generally
reflect each analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of shares of KCS common stock. In order to better compare the
equity analysts’ stock price targets with the merger consideration, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst’s price target to present value
by applying, for a one year discount period, a discount rate of 7.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley based on the application of its
professional judgment and experience to reflect KCS’s cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst price target range for
shares of KCS common stock of $186.00 to $239.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate of 7.4% to
reflect KCS’s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into account market risk premium,
risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock.
•
Discounted Equity Value Analysis. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley performed a
discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of the future implied value of a company’s
common equity as a function of such company’s estimated future earnings and a theoretical range of trading multiples. The resulting
estimated future implied value of equity is subsequently discounted back to the present day at the company’s cost of equity in order to
arrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value for the company’s theoretical future implied stock price. Morgan Stanley used a
discount rate of 7.4% to reflect KCS’s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into
account market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used a NTM P/E multiple range of 17.0x to
21.0x based on KCS’s and comparable companies’ NTM P/E multiples over time.
In arriving at the estimated equity values per share of KCS common stock, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of ratio of stock
price to future earnings per share (“P/E Multiple”) utilizing the next 12 months (“NTM”) estimated earnings per share and applied this range
of multiples to an estimate of fiscal year 2029 earnings per share from the KCS management unaudited KCS projections. Morgan Stanley
then discounted the resulting equity values per share to June 30, 2021 at a discount rate of 7.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley based on the
application of its professional judgment and experience to reflect KCS’s cost of equity. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a
range of implied equity values per share of KCS common stock as follows, each rounded to the nearest $1.00:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value
of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied equity values per
CPRL common share as of June 30, 2021, based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the six months ending December 31, 2021 and fiscal
years 2022 through 2029 contained in the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, including net debt of CPRL as of June 30, 2021 of $6,027 million.
Morgan Stanley also calculated a range of terminal values for CPRL based on NTM EBITDA exit multiple range of 11.75x to 13.25x, which was selected
based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The estimated unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then
discounted to June 30, 2021 by applying a discount rate range of 5.4% to 6.7%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment
and experience, to reflect CPRL’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Morgan Stanley used a discount rate range of 5.4% to 6.7% to reflect CPRL’s
estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight,
and then adding the products together to determine the value. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into account market risk
premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock. Morgan Stanley used an EBITDA exit multiple range of 11.75x to 13.25x based on CPRL’s and
comparable companies’ EBITDA multiples over time.
This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per CPRL common share of $76.00 to $93.00, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00.
Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied equity values per CPRL common share to the closing trading price of CPRL common shares on
September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price per CPRL common share on March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70 (taking into account the share split).
Comparable Public Company Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a comparable public company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial information of CPRL with corresponding publicly available
financial information for other Class 1 Rail companies that shared certain similar characteristics to CPRL to derive an implied valuation range for CPRL.
The companies used in this comparison were the following:
•
KCS
•
CN
•
Union Pacific Corporation
•
Norfolk Southern Corporation
•
CSX Corporation
The above companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley’s knowledge of the industry and because they have businesses that may be considered
similar to CPRL’s. Although none of such companies are identical or directly comparable to CPRL, these companies are publicly traded companies with
operations and/or other criteria, such as lines of business, markets, business risks, growth prospects, maturity of business and size and scale of business,
that for purposes of its analysis Morgan Stanley considered similar to CPRL.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the following statistics of each of these companies, based on public filings, publicly available
research estimates and publicly available financial information published by

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of 2022E AV/EBITDA Ratio and 2022E P/E Ratio and applied these ranges to CPRL’s estimated fiscal year
2022 EBITDA of $3,900 million based on consensus analyst estimates and of $3,862 million based on the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections,
and to CPRL’s estimated fiscal year 2022 earnings per share of $3.63 based on consensus analyst estimates and of $3.67 based on the KCS management
unaudited CPRL projections. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections and consensus
analyst estimates.
Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied equity values per CPRL common share as follows, in each case rounded to the nearest $1.00:

September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price on March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70.

Table of Contents
No company included in the comparable public company analysis is identical to CPRL. In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which
are beyond the control of CPRL. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of CPRL and the industry generally,
industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPRL and the industry, and in the financial
markets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Other Factors
Morgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced
for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
•
Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the low and high
per share trading range of CPRL common shares for the 12-month period ending March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). Morgan Stanley observed that during such period the trading range was
$36.00 to $77.00 per CPRL common share (taking into account the share split), rounded to the nearest $1.00.
•
Equity Research Analysts’ Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the
undiscounted price targets for CPRL common shares prepared and published by 24 equity research analysts as of March 19, 2021 (which
was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement). These targets generally reflect each
analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of CPRL common shares. In order to better compare the equity analysts’ stock
price targets with the trading price of CPRL common shares on September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and to the closing trading price of $75.70 on
March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), Morgan Stanley discounted each
analyst’s price target to present value by applying, for a one year discount period, a discount rate of 6.4%, selected by Morgan Stanley
based on the application of its professional judgment and experience to reflect CPRL’s cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a discounted
analyst price target range for CPRL common shares of $64.00 to $76.00 per share, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Morgan Stanley used a
discount rate of 6.4% to reflect CPRL’s estimated cost of equity. Cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM. The CAPM takes into
account market risk premium, risk-free rate and beta of the underlying stock.
Summary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis
Has/Gets Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a Has/Gets Analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for holders of KCS common stock resulting from the
transaction based on a comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by holders of KCS common stock of CPRL giving effect to the transaction, and (ii) the
100% ownership by holders of KCS common stock of the KCS common stock on a standalone basis. For KCS common stock on a standalone basis,
Morgan Stanley used the reference range obtained in the discounted cash flow analysis described above under “Summary of Material Financial
Analyses of KCS – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.” Morgan Stanley then performed the same analysis by calculating the range of implied per share
equity values allocable to holders of KCS common stock on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the transaction, by assuming approximately 28% pro forma
ownership, based on the number of CPRL common shares estimated to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction, utilizing the results
of the standalone discounted cash flow analyses for KCS and CPRL described above under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS –
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of CPRL – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” and

Table of Contents
taking into account the KCS management assumed synergies on the basis of (1) a projected $990 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS
management (referred to in this section as the “$990 million synergy case”), which also included $20 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies, for
total projected gross synergies of $1,010 million, and (2) a projected $377 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in
this section as the “$377 million synergy case”), which also included $23 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies for total projected gross
synergies of $400 million. Morgan Stanley then compared these implied per share equity value ranges, which were further adjusted by an estimated
additional net debt from the transaction and $90.00 per share cash merger consideration, to the implied per share equity value ranges derived for KCS
common stock on a standalone basis utilizing the results of the standalone discounted cash flow analysis for KCS described above.
This analysis yielded the following implied per share equity value ranges for KCS common stock on a standalone and on a pro forma basis (rounded to
the nearest $1.00):
Implied Equity Value Per Share of KCS common stock
Standalone
Pro-Forma $990
million synergy case
Pro-Forma $377
million synergy case
$226.00 - $280.00
$310.00 - $365.00
$291.00 - $343.00
Other Considerations
In connection with the review of the transaction by the KCS board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s
view of the actual value of KCS or CPRL.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KCS or CPRL. These include, among other things, the impact of
competition on the businesses of KCS and CPRL or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of KCS, CPRL or the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s
analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such
estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement, and in
connection with the delivery of its opinion to the KCS board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of
KCS common stock or CPRL common shares might actually trade.
The merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between KCS
and CPRL and was approved by the KCS board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to the KCS board during these negotiations but did not,
however, recommend any specific merger consideration to KCS, nor opine that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate merger
consideration for the transaction. In addition, Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not in any manner address the prices at which CPRL common shares will
trade following consummation of the transaction or at any other time and Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how KCS’s or
CPRL’s shareholders should vote at any shareholder meetings to be held in connection with the transaction.

Table of Contents
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the KCS board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the KCS board in deciding to
approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the recommendation of the KCS
board with respect to the merger consideration or of whether the KCS board would have been willing to agree to different merger consideration. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its customary
practice.
KCS has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley for its services in connection with the transaction an aggregate fee, which is currently estimated, based on the
information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $63 million, a portion of which was paid upon the execution and announcement
of the prior CP merger agreement in March 2021, a portion of which was paid to Morgan Stanley upon the rendering of a fairness opinion in connection
with the CN agreement announced in May 2021, a portion of which was payable upon the rendering of its opinion in connection with the transaction and
the remainder of which is payable upon the closing of the transaction. KCS has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain of its expenses
incurred in performing its services, including fees and expenses of outside counsel to Morgan Stanley. In addition, KCS has agreed to indemnify Morgan
Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its
affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley’s
engagement.
In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services to KCS and its
affiliates and have received aggregate fees of approximately $5 million to $15 million in connection with such services (which includes the fee received
upon delivery of its opinion in connection with the prior CP merger agreement announced in March 2021 and the fee received upon delivery of its opinion
in connection with the CN agreement announced in May 2021). In addition, Morgan Stanley or one of its affiliates is currently a lender to each of KCS
and CPRL under their respective revolving credit facilities, and is also currently engaged to provide financing services to CPRL that are unrelated to the
transaction, for which Morgan Stanley expects to receive customary fees. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing
services to KCS, CPRL and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its
securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at
any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of CPRL, KCS, their respective affiliates or
any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
Opinion of BofA Securities
KCS retained BofA Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. KCS
selected BofA Securities to act as KCS’s financial advisor in connection with the transaction on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in transactions
similar to the transaction, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with KCS and its business.
On September 15, 2021, at a meeting of the KCS board held to evaluate the transaction, BofA Securities delivered to the KCS board an oral opinion, which
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated

Table of Contents
September 15, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in BofA
Securities’ written opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the transaction by holders of KCS common stock (other than “excluded shares”)
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the KCS board, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,
factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of BofA
Securities’ written opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to the KCS board for the benefit and use of the KCS board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the mergers. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other terms or other aspects or
implications of the transaction and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the transaction in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to KCS or in which KCS might engage or as to the underlying business decision of KCS to proceed with or effect
the transaction. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the transaction and does not express any opinion or recommendation as
to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the transaction or any related matter.

(10)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and
other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities and has relied upon the
assurances of the managements of KCS and CPRL that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data
inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, BofA Securities was advised by KCS,
and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management
of KCS as to the future financial performance of KCS. With respect to the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections and the KCS management
assumed synergies, in each case, BofA Securities was advised by KCS, and assumed, with the consent of KCS, that they were reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of KCS as to the future financial performance of CPRL
and other matters covered thereby. BofA Securities also relied, at the direction of KCS, on the assessments of the managements of KCS and CPRL,
respectively, as to CPRL’s ability to achieve the KCS management assumed synergies and was advised by KCS and CPRL, and assumed, with the consent
of KCS, that the KCS management assumed synergies would be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Securities did not make and was
not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of KCS or CPRL, nor did BofA Securities
make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of KCS or CPRL. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of KCS or CPRL
under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of KCS, that the
transaction would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or other agreement contemplated therein or thereby and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory
and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on KCS, CPRL or the contemplated benefits of the
transaction. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of KCS, that (i) the transaction would qualify for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) CPRL would obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the
commitment letters, (iii) the STB would permit the transaction to close into the voting trust in accordance with the terms of the STB May 6 decision and
the voting trust agreement and (iv) the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft agreement reviewed by
BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the transaction (other than the merger consideration to the extent
expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the transaction. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS common stock (other than excluded
shares) in the transaction and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration to be received by the holders of KCS preferred stock
or any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the
transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the
transaction in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to KCS or in which KCS might engage or as to the underlying
business decision of KCS to proceed with or effect the transaction. BofA Securities did not express any opinion as to what the value of CPRL common
shares actually would be when issued or the prices at which KCS common stock or CPRL common shares would trade at any time, including following the
announcement or consummation of the transaction. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder
should vote or act in connection with the transaction or any related matter.

The discussion set forth below in the subsections entitled “—Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS,” “—Summary of Material Financial
Analyses of CPRL,” and “—Summary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis,” beginning on pages 87, 91, and 93, respectively, represents a brief
summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the KCS board in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Securities.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.
BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the following five selected publicly traded companies in the rail
transportation industry:
•
Union Pacific Corporation
•
CN
•
CSX Corporation
•
Norfolk Southern Corporation
•
CPRL
BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the closing price per share as of September 13, 2021 for Union Pacific Corporation, CSX Corporation and
Norfolk Southern, as of April 19, 2021 for CN (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the CN proposal) and as of March 19, 2021 for
CPRL (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), as a multiple of Wall Street analyst
consensus estimates of calendar year 2022 earnings per share (“EPS”) for the applicable company (such multiples are referred to in this section as “2022E
Price/EPS”). BofA Securities also reviewed the estimated enterprise value, calculated as the market value of equity plus short-term debt, long-term debt,
preferred equity and non-controlling interest, minus cash, marketable securities and investments, as applicable (“EV”) for each selected company, as a
multiple of Wall Street analyst consensus estimates of calendar year 2022 EBITDA (such multiples are referred to in this section as “2022E EV/EBITDA”).
Financial data of the selected companies were derived from their public filings and publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates published
by FactSet as of September 13, 2021.

The overall low to high 2022E Price/EPS multiples observed for the selected companies were 18.2x to 22.6x (with a mean of 19.8x and median of 18.5x).
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the 2022E Price/EPS multiples for the selected companies and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA
Securities applied a 2022E Price/EPS multiple reference range of 18.5x to 22.0x to KCS management’s estimated calendar year 2022 EPS as reflected in the
KCS management unaudited KCS projections to calculate an implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the
nearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 18.5x to 22.0x was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience as well as the observable
range of the selected publicly traded companies.
The overall low to high 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were 11.7x to 14.7x (with a mean of 13.2x and median of 12.8x).
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected companies and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA
Securities applied a 2022E EV/EBITDA multiple reference range of 12.0x to 15.0x to KCS management’s estimated calendar year 2022 EBITDA as reflected
in the KCS management unaudited KCS projections to calculate an implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the
nearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 12.0x to 15.0x was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience as well as the observable
range of the selected publicly traded companies.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference ranges per share of KCS common stock, as compared to the implied
value of the merger consideration, calculated by adding the $90.00 in cash consideration to $198, the implied value of the 2.884 CPRL common shares
included in the merger consideration based on the $68.55 closing price of CPRL common shares on September 13, 2021 (“implied consideration value”):

No selected publicly traded company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to KCS. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics (reflected, among other things, in differences in historical trading levels of these companies) and other factors that could affect
the public trading or other values of the companies to which KCS was compared.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.
BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to 21 selected transactions involving acquisitions of rail
transportation companies since 1994. For each of these transactions, BofA Securities reviewed the merger values for each transaction based on the
merger consideration paid to the

shareholders of the target company in the selected transactions (with the full transaction value implied for transactions with less than 100% being
acquired), as multiples of estimates of the target company’s EBITDA, for the last twelve months for the year in which the applicable transaction was
announced except with respect to the Glencore Rail/Genesee & Wyoming Australia and the Genesee & Wyoming Australia/Macquarie Infrastructure &
Real Assets transactions, where, in each case, such multiple was based on the estimated EBITDA for the twelve months following the announcement
made in October 2016, and based on publicly available information at that time (such multiples are referred to in this section as “TV/LTM EBITDA”).

The overall low to high TV/LTM EBITDA multiples of the target companies in the selected transactions were 6.1x to 15.2x (with a mean of 11.2x and a
median of 11.4x).
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the TV/LTM EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA
Securities applied a TV/LTM EBITDA multiple reference range of
90
Table of Contents
11.5x to 14.0x to KCS’s COVID-Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2021 of $1,600 million as provided by KCS management,
which reflects an add-back of $128 million, as provided by KCS management, for the estimated impact of COVID-19 for the third quarter through the
fourth quarter of 2020, to calculate a range of implied EV for KCS. BofA Securities then calculated an implied equity value reference range per share of
KCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 11.5x to 14.0x was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and
experience as well as the observable implied transaction multiples. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference
ranges per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied consideration value:

No selected precedent transaction used in this analysis or the applicable business or target company is identical or directly comparable to KCS or the
transaction. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics, market conditions and other factors that could affect the acquisition or
other values of the companies or transactions to which KCS and the transaction were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of KCS to calculate a range of implied present values per share of KCS common stock utilizing
estimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that KCS was expected to generate during the six-month period ending December 31, 2021
and for the fiscal years 2022 through 2029 based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for KCS
by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.25% to 2.75% to KCS’s normalized free cash flows in the terminal year. BofA Securities then
calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of KCS common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.05) by deducting from this range of present
values KCS’s net debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interest as of June 30, 2021, as reflected in KCS’s public filings, at the direction of KCS
management, and dividing the result by the number of fully-diluted shares of KCS common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method
basis, based on information provided by the management of KCS). The cash flows were discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing mid-year
discounting convention, and using a discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5%, which was based on an estimate of KCS’s weighted average cost of capital. A
growth rate range of 2.25% to 2.75% was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience and represents long-term growth outlook for
the business. The discount rate range reflected KCS’s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost
of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using
the capital asset pricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the
estimated cost of debt was based on KCS’s estimated borrowing cost. KCS’s net debt as of June 30, 2021 was based on KCS’s Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2021, which reported debt of $3,780 million and cash of $326 million. The calculation for fully diluted shares was based on approximately 91
million common shares outstanding as provided by KCS management and other dilutive shares such as options, performance shares and deferred shares.
Preferred equity of $5 million and non-controlling interest of $327 million were based on the balance sheet provided in KCS’s Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2021. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference range per share of KCS common stock (rounded to
the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied consideration value:

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ financial analyses with respect to its opinion but
were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things the following:
•
52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of KCS common stock for the 52-week period ended
March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), which was
$100.54 to $224.16.
•
Wall Street Analysts Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed 20 publicly available equity research analyst price targets for the shares of
KCS common stock available as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior
CP merger agreement), and noted that the range of such price targets (discounted by one year at KCS’s estimated mid-point cost of equity
of 7.7% and rounded to the nearest $0.05) was $185.70 to $238.65. The 7.7% discount rate applied by BofA reflected KCS’s estimated mid-
point cost of equity, which was selected based on KCS’s observable cost of equity.
•
Present Value of Future Stock Price. BofA Securities calculated a range of present values of KCS future stock prices discounted back to
June 30, 2021 by using KCS’ estimated calendar year 2029 EPS based on the KCS management unaudited KCS projections, a range of price
to next twelve months EPS multiples of 16.0x to 22.0x and KCS’s estimated mid-point cost of equity of 7.7%, as well as the expected future
dividend payments as provided by KCS management, which indicated a range of implied present values of future stock prices of KCS
common stock of $247.85 per share to $334.55 per share, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share. Multiples used were based on
BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience as well as observable historical trading data of KCS and selected publicly traded
companies. The discount rate (cost of equity) used was based on KCS’s observable cost of equity.

range of the selected publicly traded companies.
The overall low to high 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were 11.7x to 14.5x (with a mean of 13.0x and median of 12.8x).
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the 2022E EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected companies and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA
Securities applied a 2022E EV/EBITDA multiple reference range of 12.0x to 15.0x to KCS management’s estimated calendar year 2022 EBITDA as reflected
in the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections to calculate an implied equity value reference range per share of CPRL common shares (rounded to
the nearest $0.05). The selected multiple range of 12.0x to 15.0x was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience as well as the
observable range of the selected publicly traded companies.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference ranges per share of CPRL common shares, as compared to the closing
price of the CPRL common shares on September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and the closing price of CPRL common shares on March 19, 2021 (which was the last

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CPRL to calculate a range of implied present values per share of CPRL common shares
utilizing estimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that CPRL was expected to generate during the six-month period ending
December 31, 2021 and for the fiscal years 2022 through 2029 based on the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections. BofA Securities calculated
terminal values for CPRL by applying a selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.25% to 2.75%

to CPRL’s normalized free cash flows in the terminal year. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of CPRL
common shares (rounded to the nearest $0.05) by deducting from this range of present values CPRL’s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided by KCS
management, and adding net pension assets as of June 30, 2021, as reflected in CPRL’s public filings, at the direction of KCS management, and dividing
the result by the number of fully-diluted shares of CPRL common shares outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method basis, based on information
provided by the management of KCS). The cash flows were discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing mid-year discounting convention,
and using a discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5%, which was based on an estimate of CPRL’s weighted average cost of capital. A growth rate range of
2.25% to 2.75% was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience and represents long-term growth outlook for the business. The
discount rate range reflects CPRL’s estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was calculated by multiplying the estimated cost of each capital
source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together. The estimated cost of equity was obtained using the capital asset
pricing model (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity market risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt
was based on CPRL’s estimated borrowing cost. Net debt as of June 30, 2021 was based on the balance sheet provided in CPRL’s Form 10-Q dated July
29, 2021, which reported debt of $6,978 million and cash of $714 million. The calculation of fully diluted shares was based on 666.8 million common shares
outstanding and other dilutive shares such as options and performance shares. Net pension assets as of June 30, 2021 were based on the balance sheet
provided in CPRL’s Form 10-Q dated July 29, 2021, which reported $237 million.. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied equity value
reference range per share of CPRL common shares (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the closing price of the CPRL common shares on
September 13, 2021 of $68.55 and the closing price of the CPRL common shares on March 19, 2021(which was the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement) of $75.70:

•
52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of CPRL common shares for the 52-week period ended
March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP merger agreement), which was
$36.27 to $76.75 (taking into account the share split).
•
Wall Street Analysts Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed 26 publicly available equity research analyst price targets for the CPRL
common shares available as of March 19, 2021 (which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of the prior CP
merger agreement), and noted that the range of such price targets (discounted by one year at CPRL’s estimated mid-point cost of equity of
7.3% and rounded to the nearest $0.05) was $63.90 to $75.50 (taking into account the share split). The 7.3% discount rate reflects CPRL’s
estimated mid-point cost of equity, which was selected based on CPRL’s observable cost of equity.
Summary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis
Has/Gets Analysis
BofA Securities performed a Has/Gets Analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for holders of KCS common stock resulting from the
transaction based on a comparison of (i) the pro forma ownership by holders of KCS common stock of CPRL after giving effect to the transaction, and (ii)
the 100% ownership by holders of
94
Table of Contents
KCS common stock of KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis. For KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis, BofA Securities used the reference
range obtained in its discounted cash flow analysis described above under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS – Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis.” BofA Securities then performed the same analysis by calculating the range of implied per share equity values allocable to holders of KCS
common stock on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the transaction, by assuming approximately 28% pro forma ownership, based on the number of
shares of CPRL common shares estimated to be issued to holders of KCS common stock in the transaction, utilizing the results of the standalone
discounted cash flow analyses for KCS and CPRL described above under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS – Discounted Cash Flow
Analysis” and under “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of CPRL – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” and taking into account the KCS
management assumed synergies on the basis of (i) a projected $990 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in this
section as the “$990 million synergy case”), which also included $20 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies, for total projected gross synergies of
$1,010 million, and (ii) a projected $377 million in EBITDA synergies as provided by KCS management (referred to in this section as the “$377 million
synergy case”), which also included $23 million of projected D&A and Capex synergies for total projected gross synergies of $400 million. BofA
Securities calculated the present value of the synergies (including after-tax costs to achieve such synergies) as of June 30, 2021 by using a discount rate
range of 6.0% to 7.5%. The discount rate range of 6.0% to 7.5% was based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience and obtained using
the capital asset pricing model for the estimated cost of equity (which takes into account the risk-free rate, the levered beta and the applicable equity
market risk premium) and the estimated cost of debt. Estimated additional net debt of $10.3 billion was based on announced transaction debt of $8.5
billion and estimated transaction fees and expenses as well as inclusion of $1.4 billion in break fees and reimbursements. BofA Securities then compared
these implied per share equity value reference ranges, which were further adjusted by an estimated additional net debt from the transaction and $90.00 per
share cash consideration, to the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for KCS on a standalone basis utilizing the results of the
standalone discounted cash flow analysis for KCS described above.
This analysis yielded the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for KCS common stock on a stand-alone basis and on a pro forma

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of KCS,” “Summary of Material Financial Analyses of
CPRL” and “Summary of Material Pro Forma Financial Analysis” represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA
Securities to the KCS board in connection with its opinion, and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by
BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as
to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a
financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must
be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the
summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of KCS and CPRL. The estimates of the
95
Table of Contents
future performance of KCS and CPRL in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared
solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of KCS common stock of the merger consideration,
to be received by such holders in the transaction and were provided to the KCS board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any
securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any
particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual
values of KCS or CPRL.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the transaction was determined through negotiations between KCS and CPRL, rather than by any
financial advisor, and was approved by the KCS board. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the KCS board. As described
above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the KCS board in its evaluation of the transaction and should
not be viewed as determinative of the views of the KCS board or management or any other party with respect to the transaction or the merger
consideration.
KCS has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the transaction an aggregate fee, which is currently estimated, based on the
information available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $63 million, $5 million of which was paid to BofA Securities upon delivery of its
opinion in connection with the execution of the prior CP merger agreement announced in March 2021, $2.5 million of which was paid upon delivery of
BofA Securities’ opinion in connection with the alternate proposed transaction involving CN announced in May 2021, $2.5 million of which is payable
upon the rendering of its opinion in connection with the transaction and the remainder of which is payable upon the closing of the transaction. KCS also
has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any
of its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other person controlling BofA Securities or any of its affiliates,
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of BofA Securities’ engagement.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,
foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and
investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of BofA Securities’ businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or
on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in
equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of KCS, CPRL and certain of their
respective affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to KCS and its affiliates and have received, or in the future may receive, compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted as a joint bookrunner on certain debt capital markets transactions for KCS, (ii) having acted as a dealer-manager on an
accelerated share repurchase transaction for KCS and (iii) having acted or acting as administrative agent, co-lead arranger and joint bookrunner for, and
as a lender (including a letter of credit lender) under, KCS’s $600 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility due March 8, 2024. From September 1,
2019, through August 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from KCS and its affiliates of approximately $10.4 million for
corporate and/or investment banking services, which includes the fee received upon delivery of its opinion in connection with the CN proposal.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to CPRL and its affiliates and
96
Table of Contents
have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted as a bookrunning manager and/or
co-manager on certain debt capital markets transactions for CPRL, (ii) having acted or acting as a lender under CPRL’s $1.3 billion revolving credit facility,
which consists of a $1.0 billion tranche and a $300 million tranche, which was amended on September 24, 2021 to extend the maturity dates of such
tranches to September 27, 2026 and September 27, 2023, respectively, and (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury services and products to
CPRL. From September 1, 2019, through August 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from CPRL of approximately $6.6
million for corporate and/or investment banking services. In addition, BofA Securities received a customary fee of less than $100,000 in connection with
its commitment to act as a lender under CPRL’s amended revolving credit facility, which was received subsequent to such period.

KCS Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
As described under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The KCS Merger Proposal—Background of the Transaction,” on page 49,
KCS management maintains the KCS long-range plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the KCS board, that reflects KCS management’s
financial and business outlook for KCS over a ten-year period. This KCS long-range plan was reviewed by the KCS board in connection with its
consideration of a transaction with CPRL, CN and other potential strategic alternatives throughout the latter half of 2020 continuing through its meeting
on September 15, 2021. The KCS long-range plan included certain unaudited prospective financial information concerning KCS on a standalone basis for
the fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 through December 31, 2029. We refer to these unaudited projections as the “KCS management unaudited KCS
projections”. The KCS management unaudited KCS projections were provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, which were directed by KCS
management to use and rely upon the KCS management unaudited KCS projections for purposes of their respective financial analyses and fairness
opinions. In addition, certain of the KCS management unaudited KCS projections were provided to CPRL, the CPRL board and their respective financial
advisors, BMO, Goldman Sachs and Evercore.
In connection with the transaction, KCS management also prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information concerning CPRL on a standalone
basis using (i) the CPRL five-year plan (as prepared by CPRL management and provided to KCS management) and (ii) extrapolations prepared by KCS
management on the basis of the CPRL five-year plan for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through December 31, 2029. Such unaudited
prospective financial information was translated into U.S. dollar amounts from the original Canadian dollar amounts presented in the CPRL five-year plan
based on an assumed foreign exchange ratio of 1.25x. We refer to these unaudited projections as the “KCS management unaudited CPRL projections,”
and the KCS management unaudited KCS projections and the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections, collectively, as the “KCS management
unaudited projections”. The KCS management unaudited CPRL
97Table of Contents
projections were provided to the KCS board in connection with its consideration of the transaction as well as to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities,
which were directed by KCS management to use and rely upon the KCS management unaudited CPRL projections for purposes of their respective
financial analyses and fairness opinions.
The KCS management unaudited projections were prepared treating KCS and CPRL, respectively, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the
transaction, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the transaction, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with the transaction
or the consummation thereof, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the transaction, the effect of any
business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or in anticipation of the
transaction, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been
executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the transaction.
In connection with the transaction, KCS management prepared pro forma analyses, which were presented to the KCS board, that included CPRL’s
estimated potential earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITDA”) synergies of $990 million (consisting of
$810 million from revenue synergies and $180 million from operating and expense synergies), together with an alternative case showing a lower estimate
of potential EBITDA synergies of $377 million (consisting of $222 million from revenue synergies and $155 million from operating and expense synergies).
The primary difference between the two cases was a more conservative assumption on revenue synergies (specifically the combined company’s share of
bulk commodities) in the $377 million EBITDA synergies case. The assumptions used in the $990 million EBITDA synergies case were based on CPRL’s
assessment of market opportunities that the combined company could reasonably be expected to capture, leading to a substantially greater estimate of
revenue synergies. KCS management believed, however, that for purposes of the KCS board’s consideration of the transaction, the KCS board should
also consider a synergies estimate reflecting the more conservative assumptions. The $377 million EBITDA synergies case also used slightly more
conservative assumptions with respect to operating and expense synergies. The pro forma analyses, in each case, assumed a phase-in of synergies over
the three years following CPRL’s receipt of STB final approval, beginning in fiscal year 2023. KCS management, among other things, assumed that the
aggregate cost of achieving the projected synergies would be, with respect to the $990 million synergies case, $180 million, and with respect to the $377
million synergies case, $155 million, with half of the costs to be incurred in the first year of the phase-in and the remaining half to be incurred in the
second year of the phase-in. KCS management also assumed, with respect to the $990 million synergies case, no dissynergies, $20 million of capital
expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies and a one-time capital investment of $50 million, and, with respect to the $377 million synergies
case, $50 million of dissynergies and $23 million of capital expenditure and depreciation and amortization synergies. These assumed dissynergies or
additional synergies were subtracted from or added to the EBITDA synergies estimates. The assumed EBITDA synergies, including the cost to achieve
such synergies, included in the two cases (which we refer to collectively as the “KCS management assumed synergies”) are not reflected in the KCS
management unaudited projections. The KCS management assumed synergies were provided to Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, which were
directed by KCS management to use and rely upon the KCS management assumed synergies for purposes of their respective financial analyses and
fairness opinions.
Other than annual financial guidance provided to investors, which is generally updated each quarter, KCS does not as a matter of course make public
long-term forecasts or projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of
accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the financial
projections by KCS management are being included in this proxy statement/prospectus to give shareholders access to certain non-public information
provided to the KCS board and KCS’s financial advisors and to CPRL and the CPRL board and their respective financial advisors. The inclusion of the
financial projections by KCS should not be regarded as an indication that the KCS board, KCS, the CPRL board, CPRL, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities,
BMO, Goldman Sachs or Evercore or any other recipient of this information
98
Table of Contents
considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not
be relied on as such.
This prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but,
in the view of KCS’s management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation,
and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of KCS’s management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected
future financial performance of KCS or CPRL, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the KCS management unaudited
projections or the KCS management assumed synergies. Although KCS’s management believes there is a reasonable basis for the KCS management
unaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies, KCS cautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the
KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies. This summary of the KCS management unaudited projections and
the KCS management assumed synergies is included in this proxy statement/prospectus because the KCS management unaudited projections and the
KCS management assumed synergies were provided to KCS’s financial advisors and to the KCS board for purposes of considering and evaluating the
transaction and the merger agreement.
Other than annual financial guidance provided to investors, CPRL does not as a matter of course share with third parties long-term forecasts or
projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficult of accurately predicting
financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. CPRL’s management prepared and provided to
KCS’s management the CPRL five-year plan solely in connection with KCS’s consideration of a transaction with CPRL. The fact that the CPRL five-year
plan was provided to KCS management should not be regarded as an indication that the CPRL board, CPRL, KCS or any other recipient of the CPRL five-
year plan considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results of CPRL, and
it should not be relied on as such.
The KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management assumed synergies are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects
and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS
management assumed synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by
KCS’s management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including
general economic conditions, industry trends, the regulatory environment, competition, and the risks discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus under
the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” beginning on pages 36 and 21, respectively.
See also “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 229. The KCS management unaudited projections and the KCS management
assumed synergies also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the KCS management unaudited
projections were developed for KCS on a standalone basis without giving effect to the transaction, they do not reflect any divestitures or other
restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, any synergies that may be
realized as a result of the transaction or any changes to KCS’s or CPRL’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the
transaction. There can be no assurance that the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies will be realized, and
actual results may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which the KCS management unaudited projections and the
KCS management assumed synergies relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the information becomes.
The KCS management unaudited projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that KCS believes are helpful in understanding its past
financial performance and future results. KCS management regularly uses a
99
Table of Contents
variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP
financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While KCS believes that these non-
GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze KCS’s financial and business
trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of KCS’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures of KCS’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.
Financial measures included in projections provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction
are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the SEC, and therefore such financial measures are not subject to
SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a
GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to and were not relied on by Morgan Stanley or BofA
Securities for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions or by the KCS board in connection with its consideration of the transaction,
nor were they provided to CPRL or its financial advisors. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures has not been provided.
None of KCS, CPRL, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can provide any assurance
that actual results will not differ from the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies, and none of them
undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed
synergies to reflect circumstances existing after the date the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies were
prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the KCS management unaudited
projections or the KCS management assumed synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable securities laws, KCS
does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed
synergies, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be in error. None of KCS or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives has made or makes any representation to any KCS stockholder or other person regarding KCS’s ultimate performance compared to the
information contained in the KCS management unaudited projections or the KCS management assumed synergies or that forecasted results will be
achieved. KCS has made no representation to CPRL, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the KCS management unaudited projections or the
achieved. KCS has made no representation to CPRL, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the KCS management unaudited projections or the
KCS management assumed synergies.
The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, KCS management. Neither
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP nor Deloitte LLP have audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP nor Deloitte LLP express an opinion or any other

In considering the recommendations of the KCS board, KCS stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of KCS have interests
in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of KCS stockholders generally. The KCS board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and in recommending to KCS stockholders that the merger agreement be
adopted. KCS stockholders should take the interests described below into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the KCS merger proposal. Note
that the transaction will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of the KCS compensation arrangements described below. For purposes of this
section, a “qualifying termination” generally means (i) a termination by CPRL, KCS or any of their respective subsidiaries without “cause” or (ii) a
termination of employment with “good reason,” in each case occurring during the period that begins on the effective time and ends on the second
anniversary of the control date.
For purposes of this disclosure, the named executive officers of KCS are as follows:
Name of Executive Officer
Position
Patrick J. Ottensmeyer
President and Chief Executive Officer
Michael W. Upchurch
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Jeffrey M. Songer
Executive Vice President Strategic Merger Planning
Brian D. Hancock(1)
Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer
Michael J. Naatz

(1)
Mr. Hancock’s employment with KCS terminated on July 2, 2021.
For purposes of this disclosure, the other executive officers are John F. Orr, Executive Vice President, Operations; Warren K. Erdman, Executive Vice
President, Administration and Corporate Affairs; Oscar Augusto Del Cueto Cuevas, KCSM President, General Manager and Executive; Representative
Lora S. Cheatum, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer; Suzanne M. Grafton, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Adam
J. Godderz, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.
Treatment of KCS Equity Awards
Treatment of KCS Stock Options. Each KCS Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time
will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the
102Table of Contents
right to receive an amount of cash equal to (i) the excess, if any of (A) the value of the merger consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of such
option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of KCS common stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the effective time, less
applicable tax withholding.
Treatment of KCS Restricted Share Awards. Each KCS restricted share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was
granted prior to March 21, 2021, will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive (i) the merger consideration in
respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the accrued
but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, less applicable tax
withholding.
Each KCS restricted share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was granted on or after March 21, 2021, will, at the
effective time, be converted into an award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the value of the merger
consideration in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends
corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award. Each such cash- based award will have the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS restricted share award, except that such award will vest in
full upon a qualifying termination.
Treatment of KCS Performance Share Awards. Each award of performance shares that corresponds to shares of KCS common stock (which we refer to as
a “KCS performance share award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be converted into an award
that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive an amount in cash equal to the value of the merger consideration multiplied by 200% of the target
number of shares of KCS common stock covered by the KCS performance share award as of immediately prior to the effective time. Each cash-based
award will have the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS performance share award,
except that performance-based vesting conditions will no longer apply and the award will vest in full upon a qualifying termination.
Treatment of Director Deferred Stock Awards. Each share of director deferred stock of KCS that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time, will, at the effective time, be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, less applicable tax withholding.
For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the transaction closes on December 31, 2021 and each of the
named executive officers experiences a qualifying termination on that date, see “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to KCS’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” below on page 105. The estimated aggregate value of unvested and outstanding equity awards
and any corresponding accrued but unpaid cash dividends held by all six KCS executive officers, other than the KCS named executive officers, that
would vest assuming that the transaction closes on December 31, 2021 and all such executive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is
$16,646,120 (in the aggregate). Additionally, upon the completion of the merger, non-employee directors of KCS will receive amounts previously earned in
connection with their service on the board of directors of KCS that were deferred in the form of KCS director deferred stock awards.
Executive Severance Arrangements
Each of KCS’s executive officers is party to a severance agreement with KCS. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
on September 15, 2021, KCS entered into letter agreements with seven of KCS’s executive officers, including each of KCS’s named executive officers other
than Mr. Hancock. The letter agreements: (1) provide that the protection period for enhanced change in control severance (the “protection period”) will
run from the date the transaction is completed through the two-year anniversary of the control date; (2) clarify that, for purposes of determining an
executive officer’s pro-rata bonus
103
Table of Contents
and target bonus portion of cash severance, the “target award” will be the greater of the target award for the calendar year in which the executive officer’s
employment is terminated and the target award for the calendar year in which the change in control occurs and (3) for Mr. Upchurch and two executive
officers who are not named executive officers, establish the multiple applicable to the base salary and target bonus components of his or her severance
during the protection period at three times in exchange for waiving certain rights these officers had under their severance agreement in connection with
the change in control resulting from the transaction.
In addition, in consideration of (1) certain acknowledgments from the applicable executive officers that the completion of the transaction will not, in and
of itself, constitute “good reason” under the executive officers’ severance arrangements and (2) the extension by one year of the post-termination non-
competition period for each of the executive officers other than Mr. Songer, the letter agreements provide that, in the event that an executive officer
receives any payments or benefits that are subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the executive officer will receive a payment that puts the
executive officer in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply.
One executive officer who is not a named executive officer is party to an employment agreement with KCS that was in effect prior to entry into the merger
agreement and already provided for a make-whole payment and severance benefits as described below.
One executive officer who is not a named executive officer and was not previously party to a severance agreement, entered into an employment
agreement with KCS providing for severance payments and benefits consistent with those provided to the other executive officers, as described in the
paragraph below, as well as a make-whole payment on the same terms and conditions described above.
One executive officer who is not a named executive officer is entitled to receive 90 days of salary, plus an additional 20 days of salary for each year of
service upon a qualifying termination, as well as other statutory benefits in connection with the executive officer’s service, pursuant to Mexican law.
Upon a qualifying termination, each executive officer, other than the executive officer described in the immediately preceding paragraph, will be entitled to
receive:
(i) cash severance equal to:
(A) three times the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and target bonus, in the case of Messrs. Ottensmeyer, Upchurch and two
executive officers who are not named executive officers;
(B) two times the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and target bonus, in the case of Messrs. Songer, Naatz and one executive officer
who is not a named executive officer; and
(C) 320% of base salary for two executive officers who are not named executive officers,
(ii) for all executive officers, other than two executive officers who are not named executive officers, the executive officer’s target bonus for the
fiscal year in which the termination occurs, prorated for the number of days in the calendar year prior to the executive officer’s termination of employment,
(iii) for all executive officers, other than one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, monthly cash reimbursement payments for the
difference between the monthly COBRA premium paid by the executive officer and the monthly premium amount paid by similarly situated active
executives of KCS for an 18-month period,
(iv) for one executive officer, who is not a named executive officer, regardless of whether he incurs a qualifying termination, three years of
continued participation in all of KCS’s health, benefit, welfare, retirement and other similar plans, including employee stock ownership plans, and
104
Table of Contents
(v) for all executives, other than two executive officers, who are not named executive officers, outplacement benefits for one year, with a maximum
value of $25,000.
The severance amounts described in clause (i) above are payable in equal installments over 12 months.
Other than in the case of one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, the severance benefits described above are subject to the executive
officer executing an arbitration agreement and signing a general release of employment-related claims in favor of KCS. In addition, the agreements include,
for each executive officer other than one executive officer who is not a named executive officer, a prohibition on competition for a period of two years
following the executive officer’s termination of employment (one year for each of Messrs. Songer and Hancock and one executive officer who is not a
named executive officer), and a perpetual non-disparagement obligation and employee and customer non-solicitation restrictions that apply for a period
of two years following the executive officer’s termination of employment (one year for each of Messrs. Songer and Hancock and one executive officer
who is not a named executive officer). All executive officers are also subject to a perpetual confidentiality obligation.
The estimated value of the make-whole payment for each named executive officer is set forth below in the table entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation
Table” and, for purposes of this quantification, does not reflect the impact of any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under Section
4999 of the Code, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable compensation for
services rendered following the closing. Based on the same assumptions set forth in the subsection below entitled “Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to KCS’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” and in footnote 4 to the “Golden Parachute
Compensation Table,” the estimated aggregate make-whole payments for all of KCS’s executive officers who are not named executive officers would be
$8,121,350, which value is a conservative estimate and does not reflect the impact of any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under
Section 4999 of the Code, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable
compensation for services rendered following the closing.
The estimated value of the severance payments and benefits for each of the named executive officers is set forth below in the table entitled “Golden
Parachute Compensation Table.” Based on the same assumptions set forth in the subsection below entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and
Benefits to KCS’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction” and in footnote 1 to the “Golden Parachute Compensation Table,” the
estimated aggregate cash severance payment for all of KCS’s executive officers who are not named executive officers, is $10,417,300, of which the portion
applicable to the non-U.S. executive officer was converted from pesos to USD based on the September 27, 2021 exchange rate published by the Bank of
Mexico.
Retention Program
KCS has established a cash-based retention program for KCS employees that is designed to promote retention, incentivize the completion of the
transaction and reward extraordinary effort. Each award granted pursuant to the retention program will vest and become payable in two installments: (1)
25% on the earlier of (a) the closing date and (b) February 21, 2022, and (2) 75% on the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the control date and (b) June 1,
2023, subject, in each case, to the recipient’s continued employment through the applicable vesting dates; provided, however, that if the recipient
experiences a qualifying termination, then the recipient will be entitled to any then unpaid portion of the recipient’s award. KCS has granted retention
awards in the amount of $2,120,000; $1,082,000; $1,076,000 and $1,018,000 to each of Messrs. Ottensmeyer, Upchurch, Songer and Naatz, respectively.
KCS has granted retention awards equal to $4,384,500 in the aggregate to the KCS executive officers who are not named executive officers.
Treatment of 2021 and 2022 Bonuses
KCS and CPRL have agreed that, with respect to the 2021 and 2022 annual bonuses for all employees, including the executive officers, if the control date
has not occurred prior to the date that such annual bonuses are payable,
105
Table of Contents
KCS will be permitted to pay such bonuses at the greater of (i) target performance and (ii) 130% of actual performance, but in no event greater than 200%
of target, and if the control date has occurred prior to the date that such annual bonuses are payable, then CPRL will pay such bonuses at the applicable
greater of amount.
Continued Indemnification and Insurance
From and after the effective time, CPRL and the second surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or
employee of KCS and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of KCS or its subsidiaries, in each case determined as of the
effective time, against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time.
Prior to the effective time, KCS will obtain and fully pay for “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the effective
time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as KCS’s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, subject to certain limitation and premium
thresholds. For additional details regarding the indemnification and insurance described herein, see the discussion under the section entitled “The KCS
Merger Proposal—Indemnification and Insurance,” on page 157.
Arrangements with CPRL
As of the date hereof, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with CPRL or any of its affiliates regarding employment with CPRL or
one or more of its affiliates following the consummation of the transaction. Prior to or following the control date certain of our executive officers may have
discussions, or may enter into agreements with, CPRL or one of its affiliates regarding employment with CPRL or one or more of its affiliates.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to KCS’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about certain compensation for each named executive officer KCS that is based on, or otherwise related to, the transaction. For additional details
regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described herein, see the discussion under the subsection entitled “Interests of KCS’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Transaction,” on page 101. The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may
not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect
certain compensation actions that may occur after the date hereof and before the transaction closes. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the
following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of KCS common stock is $273.70, which is the average closing price per share of KCS common stock as
reported on the NYSE over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transaction on September 15, 2021;
•
The transaction closes on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed closing date solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;
•
Each named executive officer of KCS experiences a qualifying termination on the assumed closing date of December 31, 2021 and
immediately following the closing of the transaction;
106
Table of Contents
•
Each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of September 27, 2021;
and
•
Each named executive officer’s unvested and outstanding equity awards are as of September 27, 2021 and no named executive officer
receives any additional equity grants on or prior to the completion of the transaction.
For purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, “single trigger” refers to payments and benefits that arise as a result of the closing of the transaction
and “double trigger” refers to payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the closing of the transaction and a qualifying termination of
employment.

Cash Severance and Retention Bonus for Named Executive Officers. Pursuant to each named executive officer’s severance agreement and the
amendments to those severance agreements, as applicable, upon a qualifying termination, each named executive officer will become entitled to a
cash severance payment equal to (i) the applicable multiple of the applicable named executive officer’s base salary and target bonus award plus (ii)
the prorated target bonus award for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs. The applicable multiple is 3.0 for Messrs. Ottensmeyer and
Upchurch and 2.0 for all other named executive officers. These cash severance payments are conditioned upon the named executive officer
executing an arbitration agreement and signing a general release of employment-related claims in favor of KCS. In addition, the named executive
officers are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that apply for a period of two years following the executive officer’s
qualifying termination of employment (one year for each of Messrs. Songer and Hancock). This column also includes the value of the named
executive officer’s retention bonus, if any.
The amounts in this column are considered “double trigger” amounts as they will generally only become payable in the event of a qualifying
termination of employment following the completion of the transaction or, in the case of the retention bonuses, based on the named executive
officer’s continued employment for a specified period of time. For additional disclosure related to the amounts disclosed in this column, see the
subsections above entitled “Executive Severance Arrangements” and “Retention Program.”

Outstanding and Unvested Equity Awards. The amounts in this column represent the estimated value that may be received by the KCS named
executive officers in respect of their unvested and outstanding KCS equity awards. The KCS unvested stock options will vest and be converted at
the effective time into the right to receive a cash payment. The value of the cash payment for the KCS stock options is calculated by multiplying the
excess of $273.70 over the per share exercise price of the applicable KCS stock option by the number of shares subject to that KCS stock option.
The value of the cash payment for the KCS restricted
107
Table of Contents
share awards is calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the KCS restricted share award by $273.70 and then adding the accrued
but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share subject to that KCS restricted share award. The KCS performance share awards will be
converted into a cash-based award equal to $273.70 multiplied by 200% of the target number of shares covered by the KCS Performance Share
Award. The amounts payable with respect to the KCS stock options and the KCS restricted share awards in this column are considered “single
trigger” amounts, as such awards will become payable solely as a result of the closing of the transaction. The amounts payable with respect to the
KCS performance share awards are considered “double trigger” amounts, as such awards will become payable in the event of a qualifying
termination following the closing of the transaction. The table below assumes that the closing date occurs on December 31, 2021 and reflects the
outstanding and unvested equity awards as of September 27, 2021 based on a per share value of $273.70, less the applicable exercise price in the
case of stock options.

Benefits. The amounts in this column represent the estimated value of the KCS-paid group health care plan continuation coverage during the 18-
month period following a qualifying termination of employment for each of the named executive officers and outplacement services of $25,000 for
each of the named executive officers. The amounts in this column are considered “double-trigger” amounts as they will only become payable in the
event of a qualifying termination of employment following the closing of the transaction.
(4)
Make-Whole Payments. The amounts listed in this column represent the estimated make-whole payment each named executive officer could
become entitled to receive on a “double-trigger” basis upon a qualifying termination of employment following the closing of the transaction (and,
for purposes of this quantification, does not contemplate any common approaches to mitigating potential tax exposure under Section 4999 of the
Code, such as ascribing value to post-closing non-competition covenants or otherwise treating amounts paid as reasonable compensation for
services rendered following the closing). However, in the event that a named executive officer is subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the
Code solely as a result of “single-trigger” payments and benefits, that named executive officer would also be entitled to receive a make-whole
payment, as applicable. In addition to the assumptions described immediately prior to the table above, the amounts in this column are calculated
based on a 20% excise tax rate and each named executive officer’s estimated effective tax rate, including a federal marginal income tax rate of 37%
and applicable federal, state, local and payroll taxes. The actual amount of the make whole-payment for each named executive officer, if any, will not
be determinable until after the closing of the transaction. For additional disclosure related to the amounts disclosed in this column, see the sections
above titled “—Executive Severance Arrangements.”

Mr. Hancock’s Separation. On June 7, 2021, Mr. Hancock notified KCS of his intention to retire effective July 2, 2021. In connection with his
retirement, Mr. Hancock entered into a Confidential Separation Agreement and Full and General Release, dated June 8, 2021 with KCS, pursuant to
which Mr. Hancock will receive payments totaling $2,000,000 through July 2, 2022, as well as company-provided subsidized medical insurance
through such date. Mr. Hancock is not receiving any compensation as a result of the transaction and his unvested KCS equity awards were
forfeited upon his retirement.
The CPRL Special Meeting and Shareholder Approval",136,142
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,The CPRL Special Meeting and Shareholder Approval,"The CPRL Special Meeting and Shareholder Approval
CPRL shareholders will be required to approve the issuance of such number of CPRL common shares as is necessary under the merger agreement to issue
the share consideration. As described in the TSX listing
108Table of Contents
application filed by CPRL, based on the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL anticipates up to 277,960,197
CPRL common shares to be issuable to KCS common stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement, which represents approximately 42% of the
issued and outstanding CPRL common shares as of September 9, 2021.
Accordingly, the TSX requires that the share issuance resolution be approved by an ordinary resolution of CPRL shareholders (i.e., a majority of the
votes cast by holders of outstanding CPRL common shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the CPRL special meeting). Despite
the fact that CPRL shareholders are being asked to approve the issuance of up to 277,960,197 CPRL common shares, based on the number of shares of
KCS common stock outstanding as of September 9, 2021, CPRL expects that it would issue (at the direction of surviving merger sub and on behalf of
surviving merger sub) up to 264,723,997 CPRL common shares in the first merger and is seeking CPRL shareholder approval for the issuance of up to
13,236,200 additional CPRL common shares to accommodate the effects of rounding and for other administrative purposes in accordance with the policies
of the TSX.
At the close of business on October 29, 2021, there were approximately 91,057,137 shares of KCS common stock outstanding (including 186,658 shares of
KCS common stock subject to outstanding KCS restricted share awards) and an aggregate of 10,102 shares of KCS common stock issuable in connection
with KCS director deferred stock. Additionally, up to an aggregate of 600,516 shares of KCS common stock are issuable under KCS options and KCS
performance share awards outstanding and exercisable prior to the effective time. On this basis, up to 262,637,917 CPRL common shares may be issued or
reserved for issuance under the merger agreement as share consideration to holders of shares of KCS common stock and holders of KCS restricted share
awards and KCS director deferred stock. Immediately following the first merger, former holders of KCS common stock are expected to own approximately
28% of the outstanding CPRL common shares, on a fully diluted basis.
The actual number of CPRL common shares to be issued or reserved for issuance under the merger agreement will be determined immediately prior to the
effective time based on the exchange ratio, the number of shares of KCS common stock outstanding at such time and the number of KCS restricted share
awards and KCS director deferred stock outstanding at such time.
CPRL will be holding the CPRL special meeting to vote on the resolutions necessary to complete the transaction and other matters to be considered by
the CPRL shareholders at such special meeting. In addition to the above-mentioned resolution approving the issuance of CPRL common shares to KCS
common stockholders in connection with the transaction, at the CPRL special meeting, CPRL shareholders will be asked to approve a special resolution
authorizing and approving an amendment to CPRL’s articles to change its name to “Canadian Pacific Kansas City,” which amendment is conditional upon
the occurrence of the control date. CPRL will separately prepare the management information circular in accordance with applicable Canadian securities
and corporate laws and distribute such management information circular to its shareholders in connection with the CPRL special meeting.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the transaction will be accounted for as a business combination applying the acquisition method of accounting.
Accordingly, the total purchase consideration paid by CPRL in connection with the transaction will be allocated to KCS’s net assets based on their fair
values as of the closing of the transaction. The excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from KCS at their respective net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of KCS
will be included in CP’s consolidated results of operations only for periods subsequent to the closing of the transaction.
Upon the closing, and only for the period that the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to KCS) are held
in the voting trust, CPRL will account for its indirect 100% equity
109Table of Contents
ownership of the second surviving corporation using the equity method of accounting. Once the STB has completed its review of the transaction and
approved CPRL’s acquisition of control of KCS, CPRL will consolidate KCS prospectively, and the equity method investment will be remeasured to fair
value immediately before the consolidation occurs, with the resulting gain or loss recognized in net income. As the ultimate outcome of the transaction,
assuming receipt of STB final approval, will be a business combination, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information
presented in this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared on a consolidated basis on the basis of a business combination.

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transaction
As more fully described in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement, KCS and CPRL have agreed to promptly obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, authorizations, permits, waivers, consents, clearances,
approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods and make all necessary registrations, notices, notifications, petitions, applications, reports
and other filings and take all steps as may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any governmental entity.
KCS and CPRL are not currently aware of any material consents or other filings that are required prior to the combination of CPRL and KCS other than
those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. There can be no assurance, however, if and when any of the consents required to be obtained for the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be obtained or as to the conditions or limitations that such approvals may contain or impose.
Although CPRL and KCS believe that they will receive the required authorizations and approvals described below to complete the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these consents and approvals, CPRL’s or KCS’s ultimate ability to
obtain such consents or approvals (or any additional consents or approvals that may otherwise become necessary), or the conditions or limitations that
such approvals may contain or impose.
For more information see the sections of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions that Must Be Satisfied or Waived
for the Transaction to Occur” and “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Filings and Efforts; Other Actions,” on pages 140 and 159, respectively.
STB
Certain activities of CPRL, KCS and their subsidiaries are regulated by the STB. The provisions of subtitle IV, title 49 of the United States Code require
approval of, or the granting of an exemption from approval by, the STB for (i) the acquisition of control of two or more carriers subject to the jurisdiction
of the STB by a person that is not a carrier and (ii) the acquisition or control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of
carriers. STB approval or exemption is required for, among other things, CPRL’s acquisition of control of KCS.
The parties intend to consummate the transaction prior to having obtained STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS, through the use of a voting trust.
A voting trust is a mechanism that allows the transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares of a rail carrier to an acquiror, while keeping that rail carrier
independent and avoiding premature control of that rail carrier pending STB review of the proposed transaction. Accordingly, the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to KCS) would remain in the voting trust pending the STB’s review of CPRL’s acquisition
of control of KCS. On May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust submitted to the STB Staff
in March 2021 and granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust
agreement be modified to prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the
requisite modification. The voting trust
110Table of Contents
agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in respect to the STB’s May 6 decision.
Under the merger agreement, CPRL will, via the post-closing contributions, cause the contribution of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
second surviving corporation to merger holdco, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL. CPRL and merger holdco intend, immediately after the
closing of the transaction and the post-closing contributions, to deposit the certificates for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second
surviving corporation into the voting trust to ensure that CPRL and merger holdco do not acquire and directly or indirectly exercise control over KCS and
its affiliates prior to obtaining necessary STB approval or exemption. Instead, the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation
would be held in trust and voted by the trustee.
With CPRL’s and KCS’s planned use of the voting trust arrangement, under the terms of the voting trust agreement approved by the STB on May 6, 2021,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A of the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, the trustee would hold such
shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation (i) until the receipt of STB final approval, or (ii) if STB final approval is denied, until the trust
stock is disposed of. The voting trust agreement provides that the trustee will vote all trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or
desirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and, until the STB has issued a final
order approving the transaction and common control of KCS by CPRL, against any proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction
involving KCS but not involving CPRL or one of its affiliates. The voting trust agreement contains other terms and conditions designed to ensure that
neither merger holdco nor CPRL will control KCS during the pendency of the STB proceedings. In addition, the voting trust agreement provides that
CPRL or its affiliates will be entitled to receive any cash dividend paid by KCS.
On March 22, 2021, CPRL and KCS (collectively, the “applicants”) submitted a prefiling notification (the “prefiling notification”) to file the appropriate and
necessary documentation seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS (which we refer to as the “STB approval application”). The applicants also
submitted a motion for protective order and petition to establish a procedural schedule to the STB. On the same day, the applicants sent to the STB Staff
a copy of the original proposed form of the voting trust agreement, which was attached to the prior CP merger agreement as Exhibit A, and sought an
informal opinion that the voting trust would comply with STB standards. On March 23, 2021, the applicants filed an errata to the prefiling notification and
asked that the STB substitute a revised prefiling notification.
In the prefiling notification, the applicants noted that the proposed transaction was subject to the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. pt. 1180 (2000) rather
than the version of those regulations adopted in 2001 pursuant to the waiver for transactions involving KCSR described in 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b). 49 C.F.R.
§ 1180.0(b) provides, in pertinent part, that the STB “will waive application of the regulations contained in this subpart for a consolidation involving
[KCSR] and another Class 1 railroad and instead will apply the regulations in this subpart A in effect before July 11, 2001 . . . unless [the STB is] shown
why such a waiver should not be allowed.”
On April 23, 2021, the STB issued a decision finding that the waiver provision under 49 C.F.R. § 1180.0(b) applies to the transaction, and that the
transaction will therefore be subject to the regulations set forth at 49 C.F.R. part 1180 (2000) rather than the 2001 version of those rules.
As noted above, on May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust agreement submitted to the
STB Staff in March 2021 and granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust
agreement be modified to prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the
requisite modification. The voting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in response to the STB’s May 6
decision.

Table of Contents
On September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing for
CPRL’s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021, and that CPRL intended
to indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to that reviewed
and approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.
On September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the “same
transaction” that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB’s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL’s proposed use of a voting trust to acquire KCS
applies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.
On October 29, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed their application seeking STB final approval for CPRL to control KCS and its U.S. rail carrier subsidiaries.
Under the merger agreement, CPRL and KCS must use reasonable best efforts to prosecute all filings and other presentations made, and promptly make
any subsequent filings or presentations, with the STB with diligence, diligently oppose any third party’s objections to, appeals from or petitions to
reconsider or reopen any approval, opinion, exemption or other authorization obtained from the STB, and take all such further action as in the reasonable
judgment of CPRL and KCS may facilitate obtaining STB final approval.
STB final approval is required in order to transfer control of the trust stock from the trustee to merger holdco. If an STB denial occurs, CPRL will be
obligated to, directly or indirectly, divest the trust stock in accordance with the voting trust agreement, during a period of two years after such STB denial
or such extension of the two-year period as the STB may approve. Any such post-closing disposition would be subject to the jurisdiction of the STB to
oversee CPRL’s divestiture of the trust stock.
CFIUS
The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to review by CFIUS pursuant to Section 721. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, CPRL may not assume control over KCS’s railroad operations until the parties have obtained completion of the CFIUS Process.
The merger agreement provides for CPRL and KCS to cooperate regarding the preparation and filing with CFIUS of a declaration and/or a joint voluntary
notification in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the parties opt to file a declaration, CFIUS will initiate a 30-
calendar-day review period, at the end of which, if it determines that there are no unresolved national security concerns, CFIUS will conclude all action
under Section 721. Alternatively, CFIUS may (a) inform the parties that it is not able to conclude action under Section 721 on the basis of the declaration
and that the parties may file a written notice to seek written confirmation from CFIUS that action under Section 721 has been concluded; (b) request that
the parties file a written notice; or (c) initiate a unilateral review of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the parties opt to file a
written notice (whether in the first instance or after failing to obtain completion of the CFIUS process through a declaration filing) CFIUS will initiate a 45-
calendar-day review period, at the end of which it may (a) determine that there are no unresolved national security concerns and conclude all action under
Section 721; or (b) determine that certain circumstances warrant additional review, and commence an investigation for up to an additional 45 calendar
days (which may be extended by an additional 15 days in extraordinary circumstances). If CFIUS has no unresolved national security concerns at the end
of the investigation, it will inform the parties it has concluded all action under Section 721. If CFIUS has unresolved national security concerns at the end
of the investigation, it may send a report to the President of the United States, who may act to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.
At any time during the course of the CFIUS review or investigation, CFIUS may request that the parties take actions to mitigate any national security
concerns it has identified. Where CFIUS has completed all action with
112
Table of Contents
respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the President of the United States has announced a decision not to exercise his
authority under Section 721 with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the President and CFIUS may not take any further
action under Section 721 with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
COFECE and the IFT
Pursuant to the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law, consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement requires the approval of COFECE and the IFT, autonomous constitutional entities responsible for
enforcing the Federal Economic Competition Law in the sectors of their respective jurisdiction, including reviewing and authorizing concentrations, when
applicable. Such notifications may be submitted in parallel, and the procedures follow the same rules and legal time frame (as described below);
nonetheless, in non-telecom transactions, the notification process before the IFT is usually more expeditious than the process before COFECE.
The merger agreement provides that KCS, CPRL, first merger sub and surviving merger sub were obligated to promptly, but in any event no later than 30
business days after the date of the merger agreement, file any and all notifications and report forms to the Mexican antitrust authorities, in each case as
required under applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the process under applicable law as soon as practicable.
Notifications of the transaction were submitted to the IFT on October 4, 2021 and to COFECE on October 5, 2021. Each of the Mexican antitrust
authorities has 10 business days from the date the notifications were submitted to issue a request for information (“RFI”), and the parties to such
proceedings will have 10 business days to respond (subject to an extension of up to 10 additional business days upon prior request). Once the response
to such RFI is fulfilled, the Mexican antitrust authorities will each have 15 business days to issue a second RFI, and the parties will have 15 business
days to respond (subject to extensions of up to 55 additional business days upon prior request).
The Mexican antitrust authorities will each have 60 business days to review the transaction and issue a resolution from (i) the date on which the first RFI
is fulfilled, (ii) if a second RFI is submitted, the date on which the second RFI is fulfilled, or (iii) if no RFI is submitted, the date notifications of the
transaction were submitted to the Mexican antitrust authorities. Further, in complex cases, the Mexican antitrust authorities can extend the review period
for up to 40 additional business days.
If the Mexican antitrust authorities identify competition concerns to the parties, the parties will have the opportunity, at any point after the initial
notification is submitted and before the review process has been completed, to offer conditions on which approval by the Mexican antitrust authorities
will be contingent. If such conditions are offered, the term for the Mexican antitrust authorities to issue a resolution will be restarted. If the Mexican
antitrust authorities do not issue a resolution within the relevant review period (including any extension, if applicable), the transaction will be deemed
approved. Failure to obtain clearance from the Mexican antitrust authorities precludes the parties from closing the transaction in Mexico. The statutory
review periods have not yet commenced in this jurisdiction.
ARTF and SCT
KCS and CPRL (through KCSM) have filed notices with ARTF and SCT, which are responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, prior to the
effective time. The purpose of such notices is to inform ARTF and SCT of the change in the indirect participation in the capital stock of KCSM upon
completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The notice process is for informational purposes only, and no approval is required
from either ARTF or SCT to consummate the transaction. As part of this notice process, ARTF and/or SCT may request information from the new indirect
shareholders of KCSM and of any change in the percentages of direct shareholding.
113
Table of Contents
Mexican Rail Union
KCS has provided an informal notification to the Mexican rail union; no approval on the part of the Mexican rail union is required in order to consummate
the transaction.
FCC
KCS is subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. KCS holds, controls, and/or leases various licenses issued
by the FCC for the operation of radio and microwave facilities and the use of associated spectrum over certain defined geographic areas. KCS uses its
radio and microwave facilities to support its railroad operations and public safety related to those operations. FCC approval of the transfer of KCS’s FCC
licenses will be required. Failure to receive FCC approval prior to transferring control of the FCC licenses could result in civil fines, revocation of the
subject licenses, and/or other remedial actions by the FCC. Initial approval from the FCC is expected before closing into the voting trust.
In October 2021, CPRL and KCS filed the required applications for FCC consent to the transfer of control of the subject licenses held by KCS from KCS to
the voting trust. In November 2021, CPRL and KCS anticipate that applications to transfer control of KCS as lessee or sublessee of certain FCC licenses
will be filed. Applications for FCC consent are potentially subject to public comment and possible oppositions of third parties, and require the FCC
affirmatively to determine that the transfer of control serves the public interest. While CPRL and KCS believe that FCC approval will ultimately be
obtained, this approval is not assured. CPRL and KCS anticipate, but cannot guarantee, receiving approval by the first quarter of 2022.
Additionally, if the transaction is consummated, then the FCC will also preside over a similar post-closing approval process, which would require the
filing of an application for authorization of transfer of control of the FCC licenses from the voting trust to CPRL. CPRL and KCS anticipate, but cannot
guarantee, that the FCC will ultimately approve this post-closing transfer of control of the FCC licenses. CPRL and KCS are not aware of any cases where
FCC approval did not follow STB approval.
Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights",144,148
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights,"Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights
General
If you hold one or more shares of KCS voting stock, you may be entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and have the right to dissent from the
transaction, have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive the “fair value” of such shares (exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the transaction) as of the effective time in place of the merger consideration or the preferred merger
consideration, as applicable, as determined by such court, if you strictly comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to
certain limitations under the DGCL. Any such KCS stockholder awarded “fair value” for their shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value
in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable. The
following discussion is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section
262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. All references
in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the holder of record of shares of KCS voting stock. The following discussion
does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that you exercise your rights to seek appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, KCS, not less than 20 days prior to the KCS special meeting, must notify each stockholder who was a KCS stockholder
on the record date for notice of the KCS special meeting and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights, that appraisal rights are available and include in
the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice to KCS stockholders that appraisal rights
are available in connection with the transaction. A holder of KCS voting stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve the right
to do so should review the following discussion and
114Table of Contents
the text of Section 262 of the DGCL carefully. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the
loss of appraisal rights. A KCS stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration and/or the
preferred merger consideration, as applicable.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights. If you are a KCS stockholder wishing to exercise the rights to seek an appraisal of your shares, you
must do ALL of the following:
•
you must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not
otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless properly and timely revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; if you vote by proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement or abstain from voting your shares;
•
you must deliver to KCS a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
KCS special meeting and such demand must reasonably inform KCS of your identity and your intention to demand appraisal of your
shares of KCS voting stock;
•
you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the closing of the transaction. You will lose your
appraisal rights if you transfer such shares before the closing of the transaction; and
•
you or second surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of such shares within 120 days after the closing of the transaction. The second surviving corporation is under no obligation to
file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the KCS
stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of KCS voting stock within the time
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Voting, electronically at the KCS special meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition
to and separate from any proxy or vote.
Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights. Only a holder of record of shares of KCS voting stock issued and outstanding at the time a demand for appraisal is
made and that continue to be issued and outstanding and held of record by such holder immediately prior to the effective time may assert appraisal rights
for the shares of KCS voting stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of
record, fully and correctly, as the stockholder’s name appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger). The demand for appraisal must reasonably
inform KCS of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its KCS voting stock. Beneficial owners
who do not also hold their shares of KCS voting stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to KCS. The beneficial holder must, in such
cases, have the owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of KCS
voting stock of record. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of KCS voting stock as a nominee for others,
may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to the shares of KCS voting stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising
this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of KCS voting stock as to which appraisal is
sought. Where no number of shares of KCS voting stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of KCS voting stock
held in the name of the record owner.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH
115
Table of Contents
YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER
NOMINEE, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
If you own shares of KCS voting stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be
executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for
appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand,
such person is acting as agent for the record owner. If you hold shares of KCS voting stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a
central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository
nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.
If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:

Attention: Corporate Secretary
The Second Surviving Corporation’s Actions After the Closing of the Transaction. If the transaction closes, the second surviving corporation will give
written notice of the closing of the transaction within 10 days after the closing of the transaction to you if you did not vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement and you made a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the closing
of the transaction, if you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you have the right to withdraw the
demand and to accept the merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, in accordance with the merger agreement for your
shares of KCS voting stock. Within 120 days after the closing of the transaction, but not later, either you, provided you have complied with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the second surviving corporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the second surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding a determination of the fair
value of the shares of KCS voting stock held by all dissenting stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The second surviving corporation is
under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any
petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the closing of the transaction, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to
receive from the second surviving corporation, upon your written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which KCS has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those
shares. The second surviving corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of 10 days of receipt of the request or 10 days after expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of KCS voting stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on
your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the second surviving corporation the statement described in this
paragraph. As noted above, however, a demand for appraisal may only be made by or on behalf of a holder of record of shares of KCS voting stock. If a
petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or
116
Table of Contents
another record holder of KCS voting stock who has properly exercised his or her appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, the second surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may order the Register in Chancery to give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition by registered or
certified mail to the second surviving corporation and to the stockholders shown on such duly verified list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice
will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the second surviving
corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders
demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss from the proceedings any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction.
If immediately before a merger the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed
on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible
for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the transaction for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to Section 253 or 267 of the DGCL. The KCS voting stock is listed on NYSE and therefore this provision may be applicable in respect
thereof, to the extent that KCS voting stock continues to be listed on NYSE until immediately before the transaction.
After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of KCS voting stock, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the
shares of KCS voting stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of KCS voting stock at the closing
of the transaction held by dissenting stockholders who have properly exercised their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the transaction, together with interest, if any, to be paid. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the closing of the transaction
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the closing of the transaction and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the second surviving corporation may pay to each KCS stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in
cash (which will be treated as an advance against the payment due to such KCS stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only
upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of
the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the second surviving corporation to the KCS stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be
so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares of KCS voting stock
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the second surviving corporation of such stockholder’s certificates.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of
117
Table of Contents
a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the closing date which throw any light
on future prospects of the combined company. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the transaction.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from
such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may
be considered.”
An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,
and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of KCS voting stock as determined under Section
262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration, as
applicable.
CPRL does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, to any KCS stockholder exercising
appraisal rights and reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of KCS voting stock is less than the value of the merger
consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the closing date or, assuming the shares of KCS voting stock remain listed on a national
securities exchange immediately before the transaction, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied, then all KCS stockholders will
lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, described in the
merger agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those costs to the parties as the Delaware Court
of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Each KCS stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own
attorneys’ fees and expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees
and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of KCS voting stock entitled to appraisal.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the effective date of the transaction, vote
the shares of KCS voting stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares, except dividends
or other distributions payable to holders of record of KCS voting stock as of a record date prior to the effective date of the transaction.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept
the merger consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger to the second surviving
corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of the second
surviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that
this provision will not affect the right of any KCS stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
118
Table of Contents
appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the transaction within 60 days after the effective date of the transaction. If you fail to perfect, successfully
withdraw your demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of KCS voting stock will be converted into the right to receive
the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In that event,
you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for your shares of KCS voting stock in accordance with the merger agreement. In view
of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a KCS stockholder and are considering exercising your appraisal rights under
the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.
THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH THE PREREQUISITES OF SECTION
262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL AND
FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY

As of September 30, 2021, CP had total long-term debt of approximately C$10.0 billion (U.S.$7.8 billion converted at the Bank of Canada exchange rate on
September 30, 2021) and KCS had total long-term debt of approximately U.S.$3.8 billion.

Pursuant to the commitment letter, BMO, GS Lending and the other financial institutions party to the commitment letter have committed to provide an
unsecured 364-day bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$8.5 billion to bridge the debt financing required to fund a portion of the cash
consideration and preferred merger consideration, and transaction fees and expenses associated with, the transaction. CPRL expects to reduce the
commitments under the bridge facility with an offering of debt securities before the closing of the transaction into the voting trust.
Effective as of April 9, 2021, CPRL amended its existing revolving credit facility to modify certain provisions relating to the calculation of the financial
covenant ratio in its credit facility. In addition, effective as of September 24, 2021, CPRL entered into an amendment to extend the two year tranche and the
five year tranche of its existing revolving credit facility to September 27, 2023 and September 27, 2026, respectively. Effective as of September 29, 2021,
CPRL entered into a further amendment to its existing revolving credit facility in order to provide financial covenant flexibility for the anticipated
acquisition financing pertaining to the transaction, which is in place for a two-year period from the date the transaction closes.
In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of September 15, 2021, by and among CPRL and CPRC, BMO, the other lenders and financial
institutions party thereto and BMO, as administrative agent, CPRC borrowed the aggregate amount of U.S.$500 million in unsecured term loans, which
have an initial six-month maturity. Borrowings under such credit facility, together with commercial paper issuance and cash on hand were used to enable
CPRL to make certain remittances in connection with the payments made by KCS in connection with the termination of the CN agreement.
Effective September 30, 2021, KCS obtained consent from the lenders under its existing revolving credit facility to permit closing into the voting trust and
to provide a limited waiver for a period of time after CPRL acquires control of KCS following receipt of STB final approval.

The following discussion is a general summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to (i) U.S.
holders (as defined below) of KCS common stock who exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration in connection with the
transaction, (ii) U.S. holders of KCS preferred stock who exchange their shares of KCS preferred stock for the preferred merger consideration in
connection with the transaction, and (iii) U.S. holders who hold and dispose of CPRL common shares received in the transaction. This discussion is
based upon the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (which we refer to as the “Treasury Regulations”), judicial authorities and
published positions of the IRS, all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations possibly with retroactive effect,
and any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.
This discussion is for general information only and is not a complete description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to KCS stockholders; it is
not a substitute for tax advice. It applies only to holders that hold their shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, and, in the case of holders
of KCS common stock receiving CPRL shares in connection with the transaction, will hold the CPRL common shares received in the transaction, as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221(a) of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
It does not apply to holders who hold both KCS preferred stock and either KCS common stock or CPRL common shares. In addition, it does not describe
all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to KCS stockholders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it apply to
holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt
entities and organizations, dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships and other pass-through entities (including S-corporations) and investors therein, U.S. expatriates, pension funds, individual retirement and
other tax-deferred accounts, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” “personal holding companies,” persons liable
for the alternative minimum tax, persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being
120Table of Contents
recognized on an “applicable financial statement,” persons that directly, indirectly or constructively, own or at any time during the five-year period ending
on the closing date owned, 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of any class of KCS or CPRL stock, excepted shareholders, persons
who received their shares of KCS voting stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified
retirement plan, holders of KCS voting stock who exercise appraisal or dissenters’ rights, U.S. holders that hold their shares of KCS voting stock, or who
will hold the CPRL common shares, in connection with a permanent establishment or fixed base outside the United States, or holders that hold their
shares of KCS voting stock or CPRL common shares as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated or risk reduction
financial transaction. This summary also does not address any considerations relating to U.S. federal taxes other than the income tax (such as estate or
gift taxes), any U.S. state and local, or non-U.S. tax laws or considerations, the Medicare tax on net investment income, any considerations with respect to
any withholding required under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any
intergovernmental agreements entered in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement),
or, except as expressly addressed below, any reporting requirements.
As used in this section, “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of KCS voting stock, and, in the case of any holder of KCS common stock that
has received CPRL shares in connection with the transaction, a beneficial owner of CPRL common shares received in the transaction, that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a
corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if a court within the
United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust; or (iv) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) exchanging its shares of KCS voting stock for the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, or holding or
disposing of CPRL common shares, generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and persons
treated as partners in partnerships that hold shares of KCS voting stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income
tax consequences to them of participating in the transaction and acquiring, owning and disposing of CPRL common shares.
The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the
transaction or to the ownership and disposition of CPRL common shares. All holders of KCS voting stock should consult their own tax advisors as to
the specific tax consequences to them of the transaction and of the ownership and disposition of CPRL common shares, including with respect to
reporting requirements and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws in light of their particular
circumstances.
Holders of KCS voting stock that are not U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable
withholding agent is unable to determine whether any cash consideration should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax
purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) on the entire amount of cash consideration payable to them in the transaction, and such holders should consult their own tax advisors
as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any CPRL common shares or shares of KCS voting stock that they own.
Under Section 367(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, special rules may apply to a U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns
5% or more, by vote or value, of the issued and outstanding stock of CPRL immediately after the completion of the transaction. Any such U.S. holder is
urged to consult such U.S. holder’s own tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction with regard to such U.S.
holder’s particular circumstances, including with respect to the possibility of entering into a “gain
121
Table of Contents
recognition agreement” and otherwise complying with the requirements of that agreement and Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding
the recognition of gain.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction
In General
CPRL and KCS intend that the transaction will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that Section 367(a)(1) of
the Code will not apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition by holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common
stock for the merger consideration (other than any excepted shareholder). The obligation of KCS to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the
receipt of an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, special counsel to KCS, or another nationally recognized tax counsel, to the effect that, on the
basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the transaction will qualify as a “reorganization” within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the transaction will not result in gain recognition under Section 367(a)(1) of the Code by holders of KCS
common stock (other than any excepted shareholder). This opinion will be based on certain facts, representations, assumptions and statements, including
those contained in the merger agreement and in tax representation letters provided by CPRL and KCS. If any of these facts, representations, assumptions
or statements underlying the tax opinion described above is or becomes incorrect, incomplete, or is violated, the validity of, and the conclusions reached
in, such tax opinion may be affected or jeopardized, and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those
discussed below. In addition, the opinion will be subject to certain qualifications and limitations as set forth therein.
Moreover, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither CPRL nor KCS intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the
tax consequences of the transaction. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position
contrary to any of the conclusions set forth in such opinion or the tax consequences described in the discussion below. In particular, if the transaction
were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of KCS common stock would be required to recognize gain or
loss on their exchange of KCS common stock for the merger consideration. If the transaction qualified as a reorganization but were to fail to satisfy the
requirements of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, U.S. holders would be required to recognize the full amount of any gain, but not loss, on their exchange of
KCS common stock for the merger consideration.
On the basis of the opinion described above that the transaction will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and that Section 367(a)(1) of the Code will not generally apply to cause the transaction to result in gain recognition to U.S. holders of KCS common stock
that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for the merger consideration (other than any excepted shareholder), the following discussion describes
the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to U.S. holders of KCS common stock (other than excepted shareholders).
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of KCS Common Stock
U.S. holders of KCS common stock that exchange their shares of KCS common stock for a combination of CPRL common shares and cash in the
transaction will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of
fractional CPRL common shares, if any) received by such U.S. holder in the transaction; and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash
(excluding cash received in lieu of fractional CPRL common shares, if any) plus the fair market value of the CPRL common shares (including any fractional
CPRL common shares deemed received) received by such U.S. holder in exchange for its shares of KCS common stock in the transaction, over (b) such
U.S. holder’s tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock exchanged. The tax basis of a U.S. holder of KCS common stock in such U.S. holder’s KCS
common stock will generally be equal to the amount paid for such stock.
Subject to the discussion below regarding potential dividend treatment, any such gain will generally be capital gain. Any such capital gain will be long-
term capital gain if, as of the effective time, the U.S. holder’s holding
122
Table of Contents
period with respect to the surrendered shares of KCS common stock exceeds one year. A non-corporate U.S. holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed
at lower rates.
In certain circumstances, cash consideration received in a transaction otherwise qualifying as a reorganization may be characterized as a dividend for U.S.
federal income tax purposes rather than capital gain where the payment of such cash consideration has the effect of a distribution of a dividend. Whether
the payment of such consideration has that effect is generally determined by treating the cash as if it were the proceeds of a hypothetical redemption by
the acquirer (or its parent) of additional share consideration deemed issued in the acquisition. If the receipt of cash in such deemed redemption would be
treated as a distribution to the U.S. holder with respect to CPRL under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, the gain recognized pursuant to the
transaction by such U.S. holder would be treated as dividend income to the extent of such U.S. holder’s ratable share of the accumulated earnings and
profits as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has ruled that gain is generally not recharacterized as a dividend under this rule in the
case of an exchanging shareholder in a public corporation whose relative stock interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to corporate
affairs. Based on this and other applicable legal authority, and on the relevant facts (including the relative amount of the cash component of the merger
consideration), cash consideration received by holders of KCS common stock in the transaction is generally not expected to be treated as a dividend.
However, these rules are complex and because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each U.S. holder’s particular circumstances, including
the application of constructive ownership rules, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to them.
The aggregate tax basis of the CPRL common shares a U.S. holder receives in the transaction (including any fractional CPRL common shares deemed
received) will generally be the same as such U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in its shares of KCS common stock surrendered in exchange therefor,
decreased by the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of fractional shares, if any) such U.S. holder receives and increased by the amount of
gain (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share), if any, such U.S. holder recognizes in the transaction. The
holding period of the CPRL common shares received by a U.S. holder in the transaction will include such U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of
KCS common stock surrendered in the transaction.
U.S. holders who hold shares of KCS common stock with differing tax bases and/or holding periods, which generally occurs when blocks of shares are
purchased at different times or at different prices, should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the transaction to them.
A U.S. holder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional CPRL share in the transaction generally will be treated as having received such fractional share in
the transaction and then as having received cash in exchange for such fractional CPRL share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized based on the
difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional CPRL share and the portion of the U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the shares
of KCS common stock surrendered allocable to the fractional CPRL share. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-
term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares of KCS common stock is more than one year on the closing date of the transaction. A non-
corporate U.S. holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of KCS Preferred Stock
The exchange of shares of KCS preferred stock for cash in the transaction will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a
U.S. holder of KCS preferred stock whose shares of KCS preferred stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the transaction will recognize
capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares
(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under “Backup Withholding and Information Reporting”) and
the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A
123
Table of Contents
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in KCS preferred stock will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such KCS preferred stock. Any such capital
gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss where the U.S. holder’s holding period for such KCS preferred stock is more than one year on the
closing date of the transaction. A non-corporate U.S. holder’s long-term capital gain may be taxed at lower rates. Deductions for capital losses are subject
to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of KCS preferred stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of KCS preferred stock.
U.S. holders who hold both KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the particular U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the transaction to them.
U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders of CPRL Shares
Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
Based on the composition of CPRL’s current gross assets and income and the manner in which CPRL expects to operate its business in future years, CPRL
believes, and the following discussion assumes, that CPRL will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes for its current taxable year and does not expect to be so classified in the foreseeable future. The tests to determine whether a
company is a PFIC apply annually and a company’s status can change depending, among other things, on changes in the composition and relative value
of its gross receipts and assets, changes in its operations and changes in the market value of its stock. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that CPRL
will not be a PFIC for its current or any future taxable year. If CPRL were to be a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owned CPRL
common shares, such U.S. holder generally would be subject, in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years (whether or not CPRL continued to be
a PFIC), to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including that gain from a sale or other disposition of CPRL common shares, as well
as certain distributions on CPRL common shares, would be subject to tax at the highest ordinary income tax rates and an interest charge and U.S. holders
would be subject to additional information reporting requirements. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential application of
the PFIC rules.
Dividends
Subject to the preceding discussion of special rules applicable to PFICs, the gross amount of any distribution of cash with respect to CPRL common
shares will be included in a U.S. holder’s gross income as a dividend to the extent of CPRL’s current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined
under U.S. federal income tax laws. CPRL does not expect to maintain calculations of earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore,
a U.S. holder should expect that any such distribution will generally be treated as a dividend from foreign sources when actually or constructively
received. Dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations. Dividends received from a
“qualified foreign corporation” by eligible non-corporate U.S. holders that satisfy a minimum holding period and certain other requirements generally will
be taxed at the preferential rate applicable to qualified dividend income. CPRL will be treated as a qualified foreign corporation if its shares are readily
tradable on an established securities market in the United States or CPRL qualifies for comprehensive benefits under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty
and CPRL is not a PFIC for either the taxable year of distribution or prior taxable years. U.S. Treasury guidance indicates that shares listed on the NYSE
will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that CPRL common
shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years.
Dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the
dividend is distributed, whether or not the currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency will equal
the U.S. dollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency for a
different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars are converted
into U.S. dollars on the day they are distributed, a U.S. holder generally will not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the
dividend income.
124
Table of Contents
U.S. holders must include any tax withheld from a dividend payment in this gross amount even though they do not in fact receive such withheld tax.
Subject to certain limitations, Canadian tax withheld and paid over to Canada will be creditable or deductible against U.S. holders’ U.S. federal income tax
liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential tax rates for qualified
dividend income. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to U.S. holders under Canadian law or under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty, the
amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against such U.S. holders’ U.S. federal income tax liability.
Sales or Other Dispositions of CPRL Shares
Subject to the preceding discussion of special rules applicable to PFICs, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other
disposition of CPRL common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the CPRL common shares disposed. Any gain or loss generally will be treated as arising from U.S. sources and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period exceeds one year. Deductions for capital loss are subject to significant limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, information reporting requirements may apply to cash payments made to U.S. holders in connection with the transaction and in respect of
CPRL common shares, unless an exemption applies. Backup withholding tax may apply to amounts subject to information reporting if the applicable
stockholder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal
income tax returns or otherwise fails to establish an exemption from backup withholding. U.S. holders can claim a credit against their U.S. federal income
tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding tax and a refund of any excess, provided that all required information is timely provided to the IRS.
U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for establishing an
exemption.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A
PARTICULAR HOLDER. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION AND OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF CPRL SHARES WILL
DEPEND ON A HOLDER’S SPECIFIC SITUATION. EACH HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT SUCH HOLDER’S OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF THE TRANSACTION AND HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF CPRL SHARES IN LIGHT OF THE HOLDER’S
OWN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX
LAWS.",154,159

This summary is based on the description of the transaction set out in this proxy statement/prospectus, the current provisions of the Canadian tax act,
relevant jurisprudence, and an understanding of the current administrative policies and practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (which we refer to as
the “CRA”) published in writing prior to the date hereof. This summary takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Canadian tax act publicly
announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (which we refer to as the “proposed amendments”) and assumes
that all proposed amendments will be enacted in the form proposed; however, no assurances can be given that the proposed amendments will be enacted
as proposed, or at all. This summary does not otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law or administrative policy or assessing practice
whether by legislative, administrative or judicial action, nor does it take into account tax legislation or considerations of any province, territory or foreign
jurisdiction, which may differ from those discussed herein.
125Table of Contents
This summary is of a general nature only and is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations applicable to the transaction.
The income and other tax consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities will vary depending on a holder’s particular status and
circumstances, including the country, province or territory in which the holder resides or carries on business. This summary is not intended to be, nor
should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular holder. No representations are made with respect to the income tax consequences to any
particular holder. Holders resident or subject to taxation in a jurisdiction other than Canada should be aware that the transaction may have tax
consequences both in Canada and in such other jurisdiction. Such consequences are not described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
with respect to the income tax consequences of the transaction in their particular circumstances, including the application and effect of the income and
other tax laws of any applicable country, province, state or local tax authority.
Application
The following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally applicable under the Canadian tax act to a beneficial
owner of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, who disposes, or is deemed to have disposed, of KCS common stock or KCS
preferred stock, as applicable, in connection with the first merger and who, for the purposes of the Canadian tax act and at all relevant times, (i) deals at
arm’s length with and is not affiliated with CPRL, the merger subs or KCS; and (ii) holds all KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock, and will hold all
CPRL common shares acquired pursuant to the first merger, as applicable (which we refer to, collectively, in this portion of the summary as the
“Securities”) as capital property (which we refer to in this portion of the summary as a “holder”). Generally, the Securities will be considered to be capital
property to a holder for purposes of the Canadian tax act, provided that the holder does not use or hold those Securities in the course of carrying on a
business and has not acquired such Securities in one or more transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.
This summary is not applicable to a holder: (i) that is a “financial institution” for the purposes of the “mark-to-market property” rules, (ii) that is a
“specified financial institution,” (iii) an interest in which would be a “tax shelter investment,” (iv) that has elected to determine its “Canadian tax results”
in a currency other than Canadian currency pursuant to the functional currency reporting rules, (v) that has entered or will enter into, in respect of any
Securities, a “derivative forward agreement” or a “synthetic disposition arrangement,” (vi) that is a partnership, or (vii) in respect of which KCS is a
“foreign affiliate,” all within the meaning of the Canadian tax act. Any such holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular
Canadian federal income tax consequences to them of the transaction.
Additional considerations, not discussed herein, may be applicable to a holder that is a corporation resident in Canada and is, or becomes, or does not
deal at arm’s length for purposes of the Canadian tax act with a corporation resident in Canada that is or becomes, as part of a transaction or series of
transactions or events that includes the acquisition of CPRL common shares, controlled by a non-resident person, or if no single non-resident person has
or acquires control, by a group of non-resident persons not dealing with each other at arm’s length for purposes of the “foreign affiliate dumping” rules in
section 212.3 of the Canadian tax act. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors.
This summary does not address issues relevant to KCS voting stock holders who acquired their KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the
exercise of an employee stock option or pursuant to another employee incentive award. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors.
Canadian Currency
For the purposes of the Canadian tax act, subject to certain exceptions (including where a taxpayer has made an election to compute its “Canadian tax
results” in a currency other than Canadian currency), all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of KCS common stock, KCS preferred
stock and CPRL common shares
126
Table of Contents
(including dividends, adjusted cost base and proceeds of disposition), as applicable, must be converted into Canadian dollars for the purposes of the
Canadian tax act. Amounts denominated in a foreign currency must be converted into Canadian dollars using the exchange rate quoted by the Bank of
Canada for the day on which the amount arose, or, if there is no such rate quoted for the particular day, the closest preceding day for which such a rate is
quoted, in accordance with the Canadian tax act.
Holders Resident in Canada
The following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Canadian tax act and any
applicable income tax treaty or convention, is or is deemed to be resident in Canada and is not exempt from tax under Part I of the Canadian tax act (which
we refer to in this portion of the summary as a “Canadian resident holder”).
Disposition of KCS Common Stock
A Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS common stock in connection with the first merger will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the
amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to the
Canadian resident holder of its KCS common stock, determined immediately before the disposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident
holder will be equal to the sum of the aggregate of the fair market value of the CPRL common shares and the cash consideration received on the
disposition (including cash received in lieu of a fractional CPRL common share). For a description of the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses,
see the subsection entitled “Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,” on page 128.
U.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS common stock in connection with the first merger may be eligible for a
foreign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders
should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular circumstances.
The cost to a Canadian resident holder of CPRL common shares received by that Canadian resident holder as a result of the first merger will be equal to
their fair market value at the time they are acquired by such Canadian resident holder. For purposes of determining the adjusted cost base of CPRL
common shares, the cost of the CPRL common shares acquired must be averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other CPRL common shares held by
the Canadian resident holder as capital property, subject to the detailed provisions of the Canadian tax act.
Disposition of KCS Preferred Stock
A Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS preferred stock as a result of the first merger will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the
amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base to the
Canadian resident holder of its KCS preferred stock, determined immediately before the disposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident
holder will be equal to the cash consideration received on the disposition of the Canadian resident holder’s KCS preferred stock. For a description of the
tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled “Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,” on page 128.
U.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS preferred stock in connection with the first merger may be eligible for a
foreign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders
should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular circumstances.
127
Table of Contents
Appraisal Rights
A Canadian resident holder who disposes of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the valid exercise of appraisal rights will realize a capital gain
(or capital loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the
adjusted cost base to the Canadian resident holder of its KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as applicable, determined immediately before the
disposition. The proceeds of disposition to the Canadian resident holder will be equal to the cash consideration received on the disposition. For a
description of the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled “Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses,” on page
128. Canadian resident holders who are considering exercising appraisal rights should consult their tax advisors for the tax and other implications thereof.
U.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock on the exercise of appraisal rights may
be eligible for a foreign tax credit under the Canadian tax act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Canadian tax act. Canadian
resident holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the availability of a foreign tax credit, having regarding to their particular
circumstances.
Dividends on CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)
A Canadian resident holder who is an individual (other than certain trusts) will be required to include in income any dividends received or deemed to be
received on the CPRL common shares, and will be subject to the gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to taxable dividends received from
taxable Canadian corporations, including the enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to any dividends designated by CPRL as
“eligible dividends” as defined in the Canadian tax act. Although there can be no assurance that any dividend paid by CPRL will be designated as an
“eligible dividend,” CPRL has posted notification on its website that, unless otherwise indicated, dividends on CPRL common shares are designated as
“eligible dividends” for purposes of the Canadian tax act. Dividends received or deemed to be received by an individual and certain trusts may give rise
to a liability for minimum tax under the Canadian tax act.
Dividends received (or deemed to be received) on a CPRL common share by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation will be included in computing
such Canadian resident holder’s income for the taxation year and will generally also be deductible in computing its taxable income for that taxation year.
In certain circumstances, a dividend received (or deemed to be received) by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation may be deemed to be
proceeds of disposition or a capital gain pursuant to subsection 55(2) of the Canadian tax act. Canadian resident holders that are corporations should
consult their own tax advisors regarding their particular circumstances. A Canadian resident holder that is a “private corporation” or a “subject
corporation,” each as defined in the Canadian tax act, will generally be liable to pay an additional tax under Part IV of the Canadian tax act, all or a portion
of which may be refundable in certain circumstances, on dividends received, or deemed to be received, on a CPRL common share to the extent such
dividends are deductible in computing the Canadian resident holder’s taxable income. A Canadian resident holder of CPRL common shares that is,
throughout the year, a “Canadian-controlled private corporation,” as defined in the Canadian tax act, may be subject to an additional tax (all or a portion
of which may be refundable in certain circumstances) on its “aggregate investment income,” which is defined to include dividends that are not deductible
in computing taxable income.
Disposition of CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)
A Canadian resident holder who disposes or is deemed to dispose of a CPRL common share after the transaction will recognize a capital gain (or a capital
loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted
cost base to the Canadian resident holder of such CPRL common share, determined immediately before the disposition. For a description of the tax
treatment of capital gains and capital losses, see the subsection entitled “Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses” immediately below.
128
Table of Contents
Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses
Generally, one-half of any capital gain realized by a Canadian resident holder in a taxation year will be included in computing the Canadian resident
holder’s income in that taxation year as a taxable capital gain and one-half of any capital loss realized in a taxation year (which we refer to as an “allowable
capital loss”) must be deducted from the taxable capital gains realized by the Canadian resident holder in the same taxation year, in accordance with the
rules contained in the Canadian tax act. Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains realized by a Canadian resident holder in a particular
taxation year may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation
year against net taxable capital gains realized by the Canadian resident holder in such taxation year, subject to and in accordance with the rules contained
in the Canadian tax act.
Capital gains realized by an individual and certain trusts may give rise to a liability for minimum tax under the Canadian tax act. A Canadian resident holder
that is, throughout the year, a “Canadian-controlled private corporation,” as defined in the Canadian tax act, may be subject to an additional tax (all or a
portion of which may be refundable in certain circumstances) on its “aggregate investment income,” which is defined to include taxable capital gains.
The amount of any capital loss realized by a Canadian resident holder that is a corporation on the disposition of a CPRL common share may be reduced
by the amount of dividends received or deemed to be received by it on such share (or on a share for which the share has been substituted) to the extent
and under the circumstances prescribed by the Canadian tax act. Similar rules may apply where a corporation is a member of a partnership or a beneficiary
of a trust that owns shares, directly or indirectly through a partnership or a trust. Canadian resident holders to whom these rules may apply should
consult their own tax advisors.
Eligibility for Investment
Based on the current provisions of the Canadian tax act and subject to the provision of any particular plan, provided that the CPRL common shares are
listed on a “designated stock exchange,” within the meaning of the Canadian tax act (which currently includes the TSX and the NYSE), or CPRL is
otherwise a “public corporation” (other than a “mortgage investment corporation”) for purposes of the Canadian tax act, the CPRL common shares will be
qualified investments under the Canadian tax act for a trust governed by a registered retirement savings plan (which we refer to as “RRSP”), a registered
retirement income fund (which we refer to as “RRIF”), a registered disability savings plan (which we refer to as “RDSP”), a registered education savings
plan (which we refer to as “RESP”), a tax-free savings account (which we refer to as “TFSA”) or a deferred profit sharing plan, each as defined in the
Canadian tax act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the CPRL common shares are “prohibited investments,” within the meaning of the Canadian tax act, for a particular
RRSP, RRIF, RDSP, RESP or TFSA, the annuitant of the RRSP or RRIF, the holder of the TFSA or RDSP, or the subscriber of the RESP, as the case may be,
will be subject to a penalty tax under the Canadian tax act. The CPRL common shares will generally not be a “prohibited investment” for these purposes
unless the annuitant under the RRSP or RRIF, the holder of the TFSA or RDSP, or the subscriber of the RESP, as applicable, (i) does not deal at arm’s
length with CPRL for purposes of the Canadian tax act, or (ii) has a “significant interest,” as defined in the Canadian tax act, in CPRL. In addition, the
CPRL common shares will generally not be a “prohibited investment” if the CPRL common shares are “excluded property” for purposes of the prohibited
investment rules for an RRSP, RRIF, RDSP, RESP or TFSA. Annuitants under RRSPs or RRIFs, holders of TFSAs or RDSPs, and subscribers of RESPs
should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the CPRL common shares will be prohibited investments in their particular circumstances.

Table of Contents
Holders Not Resident in Canada
The following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Canadian tax act, is not, and is
not deemed to be, a resident of Canada and does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock, as the
case may be, and will not use or hold, or be deemed to use or hold, CPRL common shares, as applicable, in a business carried on in Canada (which we
refer to in this portion of the summary as a “non-Canadian resident holder”). This portion of the summary is not generally applicable to a non-Canadian
resident holder that is: (i) an insurer carrying on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere or (ii) an “authorized foreign bank” (as defined in the
Canadian tax act).
The following portion of the summary assumes that none of the KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock, or CPRL common shares will constitute
“taxable Canadian property” to any particular non-Canadian resident holder at any time. Generally, KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock, or CPRL
common shares, as the case may be, will not constitute taxable Canadian property to a non-Canadian resident holder at a particular time, provided that the
applicable shares are listed at that time on a “designated stock exchange” (which currently includes the NYSE and the TSX), unless at any particular time
during the 60-month period that ends at that time (i) one or any combination of (a) the non-Canadian resident holder, (b) persons with whom the non-
Canadian resident holder does not deal at arm’s length, and (c) partnerships in which the non-Canadian resident holder or a person described in (b) holds
a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships, owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the capital
stock of KCS or CPRL, as the case may be, and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of KCS common stock, KCS preferred stock or CPRL common
shares, as the case may be, was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: (A) real or immovable properties situated in Canada, (B)
“Canadian resource properties” (as defined in the Canadian tax act), (C) “timber resource properties” (as defined in the Canadian tax act), and (D) options
in respect of, or interests in, any of the foregoing property whether or not the property exists. In certain circumstances set out in the Canadian tax act,
shares which are not otherwise “taxable Canadian property” may be deemed to be “taxable Canadian property.”
KCS has represented in the merger agreement that, at no time during the 60 months immediately preceding the effective time, will more than 50% of the fair
market value of KCS voting stock be derived, directly or indirectly, from one or any combination of the properties listed in (ii)(A) to (D) above. Assuming
the accuracy of this representation, the KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock will not be “taxable Canadian property” to non-Canadian resident
holders at the time of their disposition in connection with the first merger for purposes of the Canadian tax act.
Disposition of KCS Common Stock or KCS Preferred Stock in Connection with the First Merger
A non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common stock
or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, in connection with the first merger unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the non-Canadian
resident holder and the shares are not “treaty-protected property” of the non-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the Canadian tax act.
Non-Canadian resident holders whose KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock are “taxable Canadian property” should consult their own tax
advisors for advice having regard to their particular circumstances, including whether their KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock constitute
“treaty-protected property.” As shares of the capital stock of a U.S. corporation, the KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock will generally be
“treaty-protected property” for a non-Canadian resident holder who is a resident of the United States for purposes of, and entitled to benefits under, the
U.S.-Canada income tax treaty.
130
Table of Contents
Appraisal Rights
A non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of KCS common stock
or KCS preferred stock, as the case may be, pursuant to the valid exercise of appraisal rights unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the
non-Canadian resident holder and the shares are not “treaty-protected property” of the non-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the
Canadian tax act.
Dividends on CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)
Dividends paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, on CPRL common shares to a non-Canadian resident holder generally will be subject to
Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 25% of the gross amount of the dividend, unless the rate is reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax
convention between Canada and the non-Canadian resident holder’s jurisdiction of residence. For example, the rate of withholding tax under the U.S.-
Canada income tax treaty applicable to a non-Canadian resident holder who is a resident of the United States for the purposes of such treaty, is the
beneficial owner of the dividend and who is entitled to all of the benefits under such treaty, generally will be 15%. CPRL will be required to withhold the
required amount of withholding tax from the dividend, and remit it to the CRA for the account of the non-Canadian resident holder. Non-Canadian
resident holders who may be eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax on dividends pursuant to an applicable income tax convention should consult
their own tax advisors with respect to taking all appropriate steps in this regard.
Disposition of CPRL Common Shares (Post-Transaction)
A non-Canadian resident holder will not be subject to tax under the Canadian tax act on any capital gain realized on a disposition of CPRL common
shares, unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the non-Canadian resident holder and the shares are not “treaty-protected property” of the
non-Canadian resident holder, each within the meaning of the Canadian tax act.

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL,"THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, KCS is required to submit to a non-binding, advisory stockholder vote
certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transaction as
disclosed in the section entitled “Interests of KCS’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transaction,” on page 102. The KCS compensation proposal
gives KCS stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of KCS’s named executive officers.
Accordingly, KCS is asking KCS stockholders to vote “FOR” the adoption of the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to KCS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the transaction, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading ‘Interests of KCS’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Transaction’ including the associated narrative discussion and the agreements, plans, arrangements or
understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on the KCS compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, if you are a KCS
stockholder, you may vote to approve the KCS merger proposal, and vote not to approve the KCS compensation proposal, and vice versa. The vote on
the KCS compensation proposal is advisory and non-binding. As a result, if the transaction is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid
to KCS’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if KCS
stockholders do not approve the KCS compensation proposal.
The KCS board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the KCS compensation proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the KCS special meeting, approval of the KCS compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority
of the shares of KCS voting stock present at the KCS special meeting in person (including virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the
KCS compensation proposal. Accordingly, if a KCS stockholder present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting abstains from voting,
or responds by proxy with an “abstain” vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the KCS compensation proposal. If a KCS
stockholder is not present in person (including virtually) at the KCS special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote
count for the KCS compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

KCS, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with domestic and international rail operations in North America that are strategically focused on the
growing north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and industrial markets in the central U.S. with major industrial cities in Mexico. As used
below, “Kansas City Southern” may refer to KCS or, as the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of KCS.
Kansas City Southern controls and owns all of the stock of KCSR, a U.S. Class 1 railroad founded in 1887. KCSR serves a ten-state region in the Midwest
and Southeast regions of the U.S. and has the shortest north/south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the Gulf of
Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
Kansas City Southern controls and owns all of the stock of KCSM. Through its 50-year concession from the Mexican government, which could expire in
2047 unless extended, KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic portion of the
shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal international gateway through which a substantial
portion of rail and truck traffic between the U.S. and Mexico crosses the border. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and three of its
major seaports. KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the U.S. and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Under the
concession, KCSM has the right to use and operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River between the
U.S. and Mexico. KCS owns the northern half of this bridge through its ownership of Mexrail.
KCSM also provides exclusive rail access to the port of Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government developed the port at Lazaro
Cardenas principally to serve Mexican markets and as an alternative to the U.S. west coast ports for Asian and South American traffic bound for North
America.
Kansas City Southern wholly owns Mexrail which, in turn, wholly owns Tex-Mex. Tex-Mex owns a 160-mile rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the
port city of Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR with KCSM.
The Kansas City Southern coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex, including trackage rights) comprises approximately 7,100 route miles
extending from the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. south into Mexico and connects with all other Class 1 railroads, providing shippers with
an effective alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the Southeast and Southwest U.S. through alternate interchange
hubs.
PCRC, an unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by Kansas City Southern and Mi-Jack, was awarded a concession from the Republic of
Panama to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international
container shipping companies
135Table of Contents
with a railway transportation alternative to the Panama Canal. The concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of 25 years with an automatic
renewal for an additional 25-year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south railroad traversing the isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans.
Other subsidiaries and affiliates of Kansas City Southern include the following:
•
Meridian Speedway, LLC, a 70% owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and
Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway.” Norfolk
Southern Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns the remaining 30% of
MSLLC;
•
TFCM, S. de R.L. de C.V., a 45% owned unconsolidated affiliate that operates a bulk liquid terminal in San Luis Potosí, Mexico;

terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The terms and information in the merger agreement are not intended to provide any other public disclosure
of factual information about CPRL, KCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The
representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by CPRL, KCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub were made solely for
the purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates and are qualified and subject to important limitations and exceptions agreed to by CPRL,
KCS, first merger sub and surviving merger sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations
and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right
to not complete the transaction if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue or incorrect, and allocating risk between the
parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual
standard of materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC
or on SEDAR, are qualified by certain matters contained in certain reports publicly filed with the SEC and on SEDAR, and in some cases were qualified by
the matters contained in the respective confidential disclosure schedules that CPRL and KCS delivered to each other in connection with the merger
agreement, which disclosures were not included in the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Moreover, information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy

KCS’s or CPRL’s public disclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement except for the limited purposes expressly set
forth therein and should not rely on the representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or

Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read
together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy

First Merger
The merger agreement provides that the directors of KCS as of immediately prior to the effective time will serve as the directors of the first surviving
corporation as of the effective time, the officers of KCS as of immediately prior to the effective time will serve as the officers of the first surviving
corporation as of the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of first merger sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the
certificate of incorporation of the first surviving corporation following the effective time, and the by-laws of first merger sub as in effect immediately prior
to the effective time will be the by-laws of the first surviving corporation following the effective time.
Second Merger
The merger agreement provides that the directors of the first surviving corporation as of immediately prior to the second effective time will serve as the
directors of the second surviving corporation as of the second effective time, the officers of the first surviving corporation as of immediately prior to the
second effective time will serve as the officers of the second surviving corporation following the second effective time, the certificate of incorporation of

Post-Control Date Governance and Other Matters
The parties will take all actions necessary to designate and appoint four of the directors of KCS as of immediately prior to the effective time to serve as
directors on the CPRL board as of the control date, in each case until such director’s successor is elected and qualified or such director’s earlier death,
resignation or removal, in each case in accordance with CPRL’s constating documents. In the event that after the effective time any of the four KCS
directors selected to be part of the CPRL board upon the control date indicates that he or she plans to resign as a director of KCS and is willing to become
a director of CPRL, CPRL would need to seek the approval of the STB in order for such director to be appointed prior to the control date.
As promptly as practicable following the control date, CPRL will (i) change the name of CPRL to “Canadian Pacific Kansas City” and (ii) recognize Kansas
City, Missouri as the location of the headquarters of CPRL’s United States business and operations.

Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of KCS common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be automatically converted into the right to receive (1) 2.884 CPRL common shares and
(2) $90.00 in cash, without interest, and each share of KCS preferred stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain
excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $37.50 in cash, without interest.
The merger consideration and/or the preferred merger consideration will be equitably adjusted in the event of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares involving KCS common stock, KCS
preferred stock or CPRL common shares prior to the effective time, to proportionally reflect such change.

No fractional CPRL common shares will be issued in connection with the first merger and no certificates or scrip representing fractional CPRL common
shares will be delivered on the conversion of shares of KCS common stock. Each holder of shares of KCS common stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive as a result of the first merger a fraction of a CPRL common share (after aggregating all shares represented by the certificates and book-
entry shares delivered by such holder) will receive, in lieu of such fractional CPRL common share, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down to
the nearest cent) representing such holder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent, on behalf of all such holders,
of the aggregated number of fractional CPRL common shares that would otherwise have been issuable to such holders as part of the merger consideration
(which we refer to as the “fractional share cash amount”). As soon as practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent will, on behalf of all such
holders of fractional CPRL common shares, effect the sale of all such CPRL common shares that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the merger
consideration at the then-prevailing prices on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE. After the proceeds of such sale have been
received, the exchange agent will determine the applicable fractional share cash amount payable to each applicable holder in respect of its fractional CPRL
common shares and will make such amounts available to such holders in accordance with the merger agreement. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional
CPRL common shares to such holders is not a separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in
the exchange. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional CPRL common share that would
otherwise have been issuable as part of the merger consideration.",173,173

receive judicially determined “fair value” of such shares at the effective time. If, after the effective time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively

(i) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash consideration payable in respect of the KCS common stock and the aggregate preferred merger consideration

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time and not later than three business days following the closing date, CPRL will cause the exchange
agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, a letter of transmittal to the exchange agent and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of book-entry shares or certificates in exchange for the merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable.
On the surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of a certificate) or book-entry shares to the exchange agent, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, or, in the case of book-entry shares, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the exchange agent, and such
other documents as may customarily be required by the exchange agent, the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
book-entry shares will be entitled to receive in exchange the merger consideration or the preferred merger consideration, as applicable, together with any
fractional share cash amount and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares following the effective time). No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable on due surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares. If payment
of the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of
the payment of the merger consideration or preferred merger consideration, as applicable, to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered or will have established that such tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.
In the case of any certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the exchange agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate
the merger consideration (together with the fractional share cash amount and any dividends or other distributions deliverable with respect to such shares

holders of KCS common stock or KCS preferred stock pursuant to the conversion of shares and exchange of certificates such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law with respect to the making of such payment; provided,
however, that the representation and warranty of KCS regarding the value of its stock not being attributable to real property in Canada contained in the

any such amounts (subject to certain specifically enumerated exceptions in the merger agreement) except to the extent that any such deduction or
withholding will be required by a change in law after the date of the merger agreement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely
paid over to the relevant governmental entity, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been

CPRL and KCS have agreed they each will not, and they each will cause their respective subsidiaries and their and their respective directors and officers
not to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their other representatives, not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry regarding, or the making or submission of any proposal, offer or
indication of intent that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an alternative proposal;
151Table of Contents
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding an alternative proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an alternative proposal (except to notify such person
that the provisions of the merger agreement prohibit any such discussions or negotiations);
•
furnish any nonpublic information relating to such party or its subsidiaries in connection with or for the purpose of facilitating an
alternative proposal or any inquiry, proposal offer or indication of intent that would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
alternative proposal;
•
recommend or enter into any other letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, option agreement, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement with respect to an alternative
proposal (except for permitted confidentiality agreements as discussed below); or
•
approve, authorize or agree to do any of the foregoing or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an alternative
proposal.
Prior to the time, but not after, in the case of KCS, the KCS stockholder approval is obtained or, in the case of CPRL, the CPRL shareholder approval is
obtained, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written alternative proposal that did not result from such party’s violation of the non-solicitation
provisions contained in the merger agreement, CPRL or KCS, as applicable, may (including through their representatives) contact the third party making
such alternative proposal to clarify the terms and conditions of the alternative proposal. If such alternative proposal constitutes a superior proposal or
the relevant party’s board of directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that such alternative proposal
could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, the following actions may be taken:
•
such party may furnish non-public information to the third party who made such alternative proposal (including its representatives and
prospective equity and debt financing sources) in response to a request for such non-public information if prior to furnishing such
information, CPRL or KCS, as applicable, receives from the third party making such alternative proposal, an executed confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are not less restrictive in the aggregate to such third party than the
terms in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2020, between CPRL and KCS are to the other party (it being understood
that such confidentiality agreement does not need to include any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or
amendment of any alternative proposal); provided, however, that if the third party making such alternative proposal is a known competitor
of such party, such party will not provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to such third party other than in accordance
with customary “clean room” or other similar procedures designed to limit the disclosure of competitively sensitive information; and
•
such party may engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its representatives) with respect to the alternative
proposal.
CPRL and KCS are each required to promptly give notice to the other party if it or its representatives receive (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an alternative proposal or (ii) any request for information that, to the knowledge of such party, has been or is reasonably likely to have been
made in connection with any alternative proposal. Such notice is required to include the name of the applicable third party and the material terms and
conditions of such inquiries, proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete copies of any written requests, proposals or offers and any other
material documents, including proposed agreements). CPRL or KCS, as applicable, will be required to thereafter keep the other party reasonably informed,
on a reasonably current basis, of any material developments regarding any alternative proposal or any material change to the terms of any such
alternative proposal and any material change to the status of any such discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, neither party’s board of directors (including any committee thereof) may:
•
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify): (i) in the case of the KCS board, its
recommendation to the KCS stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and
(ii) in the case of the CPRL board, the recommendation to the CPRL shareholders to approve the CPRL common share issuance in
connection with the first merger;
•
fail to include (i) in the case of KCS, the KCS recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus or (ii) in the case of CPRL, the CPRL
recommendation in the management information circular, and;
•
if any alternative proposal that is structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for the outstanding CPRL common shares or shares of KCS
common stock, as applicable, fail to recommend within ten business days after its commencement, against acceptance of such tender offer
or exchange offer by its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable;
•
approve, adopt, recommend, or declare advisable any alternative proposal or publicly propose to approve, adopt, recommend or declare
advisable any alternative proposal; or
•
approve, adopt, recommend or declare advisable or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in compliance with the section of the merger agreement described above under the
subsection below entitled “No Solicitation” with respect to any alternative proposal).
The taking of any of the actions set forth above will constitute a “change of recommendation.”
Furthermore, each of KCS and CPRL will (and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its other representatives to) promptly terminate any existing discussions and negotiations conducted prior to the date of the merger
agreement with any person (other than CPRL, KCS or any of their respective affiliates or representatives) with respect to any alternative proposal, or
proposal or transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an alternative proposal. Each of KCS and CPRL will promptly terminate all
physical and electronic data access previously granted to such persons and request that any such persons promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning KCS or CPRL, as applicable, and any of its subsidiaries and provide prompt written confirmation thereof.
Prior to the time, in the case of KCS, the KCS stockholder approval is obtained or, in the case of CPRL, the CPRL shareholder approval is obtained, the
board of directors of KCS or CPRL, as applicable, may:
•
In response to a superior proposal, effect a change of recommendation and/or, in the case of KCS, cause KCS to terminate the merger
agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal, if: (i) KCS or CPRL, as applicable, has given the other party
written notice of its intent to take such action at least five business days in advance, setting forth a description of the terms and conditions
of the superior proposal that is the basis for such action (and including the identity of the person making the superior proposal and a copy
of the proposed definitive agreement for such superior proposal, if any); (ii) KCS or CPRL, as applicable, negotiates in good faith during
such five-business-day period with the other party (to the extent such other party wishes to negotiate) to enable such other party to make
such amendments to the terms of the merger agreement as would permit the KCS board or the CPRL board, as applicable, not to effect a
change of recommendation in connection with such superior proposal or in the case of KCS, not to cause KCS to terminate the merger
agreement in connection with the entry into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; and (iii) at the end of such five-
business-day period, prior to taking action to effect a change of recommendation
153Table of Contents
(or, in the case of KCS, terminating the merger agreement), the KCS board or the CPRL board, as applicable, takes into account any firm
commitments by the other party to amend the terms of the merger agreement made in writing and any other proposals or information offered
by the other party in response to the superior proposal, as applicable, during the five-business-day period, and concludes that the superior
proposal would continue to constitute a superior proposal if such amendments were to be given effect. For purposes of the aforementioned
negotiation period, any material modification to the terms of the superior proposal (including any change in the amount or, if applicable,
form of consideration) will be deemed to be a new alternative proposal, except that references to five business days will be deemed to be
references to three business days.
•
In response to an intervening event, effect a change of recommendation, if the KCS board or the CPRL board, as applicable, determines in
good faith, after consultation with the applicable party’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the KCS board or the CPRL board, as
applicable, to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that
the KCS board or the CPRL board, as applicable, will not be entitled to make such a change in recommendation unless: (i) KCS or CPRL, as
applicable, has given the other party written notice of its intent to take such action at least five business days in advance, setting forth a
description of the applicable intervening event; and (ii) at the end of such five business day period, prior to taking action to effect a change
of recommendation, the KCS board or the CPRL board, as applicable, takes into account any firm commitments to amend the terms of the
merger agreement made in writing and any other proposals or information offered by the other party in response to the intervening event
and determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the KCS board or the CPRL board, as
applicable, to make such change of recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law if such amendments were to be given effect.
As further described in the section below entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination or Abandonment of the Merger Agreement,” if (i) CPRL
terminates the merger agreement due to the KCS board making a change of recommendation, or if KCS terminates the merger agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal, KCS will be required to pay CPRL a termination payment of $700.0 million and the $700.0 million CN
termination amount refund, and (ii) if KCS terminates the merger agreement due to the CPRL board making a change of recommendation, CPRL will be
required to pay a termination payment of $700.0 million.
The merger agreement will not prohibit KCS or CPRL, or each of their board of directors or any committees thereof, from complying with their respective
disclosure obligations under applicable law, rules or policies of the NYSE or the TSX, as applicable.

reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the KCS stockholder approval, (iv) to comply with applicable law or (v) with
the prior written consent of CPRL (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of CPRL (which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of the merger agreement will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure
and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by KCS stockholders in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement) that KCS will
propose to be acted on by KCS stockholders at the KCS special meeting.
CPRL will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its organizational documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders following the mailing of the management information circular for the purpose of obtaining the CPRL
shareholder approval as soon as reasonably practicable following the clearance date. Unless CPRL has made a change of recommendation in compliance
with the provisions of the merger agreement, CPRL will include the CPRL recommendation in the management information circular, and will solicit, and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the CPRL shareholder approval at the CPRL special meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the CPRL
common share issuance) as soon as reasonably practicable.
CPRL will cooperate with and keep KCS informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the management information circular to its shareholders. CPRL may adjourn or postpone the CPRL special meeting (i) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the CPRL board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable law, (ii) if as of the time that the CPRL special meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the management information circular) there are insufficient CPRL common shares represented (either in person (including
virtually) or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the CPRL special meeting, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the CPRL shareholder approval, (iv) to comply with applicable law or (v) with the prior written consent of
KCS (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of KCS (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the approval of the CPRL common share issuance will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by applicable law to be voted on by CPRL shareholders in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement) that CPRL will propose to be
acted on by the shareholders of CPRL at the CPRL special meeting.
The obligations of KCS and CPRL to hold the meetings of their respective stockholders and shareholders will not be affected solely by the making of a
change of recommendation or solely by the commencement of or announcement or disclosure, or communication to KCS or CPRL, of any alternative
proposal.

merger agreement and the debt commitment letters, including payment of the cash consideration and preferred merger consideration and any fees and
expenses of or payable by CPRL, the merger subs or CPRL’s affiliates, and for any repayment or refinancing of the financing amounts. CPRL has agreed to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain

consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein on or prior to the closing date, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the debt
commitment letters and the definitive agreements within CPRL’s control and complying with its obligations under the debt commitment letters and (iv)

available funds to CPRL at the closing of the transaction to pay the financing amounts and that do not include any conditions to the consummation of
such alternative financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letters. To the extent requested in writing by KCS
from time to time, CPRL will keep KCS informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the debt financing.

party with respect to any actual material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the debt commitment letters or any
definitive agreement or any provision thereof.
CPRL has acknowledged and agreed that compliance with the foregoing obligations will not relieve CPRL of its obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement whether or not the debt financing is available and that the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letters) by CPRL or any other financing or other transactions will not be a
condition to any of CPRL’s obligations under the merger agreement.
Cooperation of KCS
KCS has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts, and each of them will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation, to the extent
reasonably requested by CPRL in writing, in connection with the offering, arrangement, syndication, consummation, issuance or sale of any debt
financing or alternative financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of KCS or its

From and after the effective time, KCS will, and to the extent within its control, CPRL will cause KCS to, honor all KCS benefit plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the effective time. For a period of one year following the control date, CPRL will provide, or will cause to be
provided, to each current employee of KCS and its subsidiaries (i) base compensation and cash and equity target incentive opportunities that, in each
case, are no less favorable than were provided to the KCS employee immediately before the effective time (it being understood that in lieu of equity
compensation awards, CPRL may provide KCS employees who, as of immediately prior to the effective time were eligible to receive KCS equity awards,
long-term incentive awards that are settled in cash in an amount sufficient to replace the grant date value of the KCS employee’s equity compensation
opportunity prior to the effective time; provided, that, subject to certain exceptions, such long-term incentive awards will have the same terms and
conditions as those applicable to the equity awards granted by CPRL to its similarly situated employees) and (ii) employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to the KCS employee immediately before the effective time. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (A) CPRL will or will cause the second surviving corporation to provide to each KCS employee whose employment terminates
during the one-year period following the control date under circumstances that would give rise to severance benefits under the KCS benefit plans set
forth on the KCS disclosure schedules, severance benefits in accordance with the terms of the
157Table of Contents
applicable KCS severance plan in which such KCS employee is eligible to participate immediately prior to the effective time and (B) during such one-year
period following the control date, severance benefits offered to each KCS employee will be determined taking into account all service with KCS, its
subsidiaries (and including, on and after the effective time, the second surviving corporation and any of its affiliates) and without taking into account any
reduction after the effective time in compensation paid or benefits provided to such KCS employee.
If the control date occurs before February 1, 2022, then no later than March 15, 2022, CPRL will, or will cause the second surviving corporation to, pay to
each KCS employee who participates in a KCS annual bonus plan (or any successor plan of CPRL and its subsidiaries) an annual bonus payment in
respect of calendar year 2021 in an amount that is based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals at the greater of (i) target performance
and (ii) 130% of actual performance, but in no event greater than 200% of target. If the control date occurs on or after February 1, 2022 but before
February 1, 2023, then no later than March 15, 2023, CPRL will or will cause the second surviving corporation to, pay to each KCS employee who
participates in a KCS annual bonus plan (or any successor plan of CPRL and its subsidiaries) an annual bonus payment in respect of calendar year 2022
in an amount that is based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals at the greater of (i) target performance and (ii) 130% of actual
performance, but in no event greater than 200% of target.
For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of CPRL and its
subsidiaries providing benefits to any KCS employees after the control date, each KCS employee will be credited with his or her years of service with
KCS and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the control date, to the same extent as such KCS employee was entitled, before the
control date, to credit for such service under any similar KCS benefit plan in which such KCS employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the control date; provided that the foregoing will not apply (x) for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, (y) for
purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or (z) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
(i) each KCS employee will be immediately eligible to participate in any new plans to the extent coverage under such new plan is comparable to a KCS
benefit plan in which such KCS employee participated immediately before the control date, and (ii) for purposes of each new plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision and any other insurance benefits to any KCS employee, CPRL will cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such new plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of KCS or its subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the control date, and CPRL will
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plans ending on
the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be taken into account under such new plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan.
The provisions described in this section are solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, and no current or former director, employee or
consultant or any other person will be a third-party beneficiary of the merger agreement, and nothing in the merger agreement will be construed as an

former directors, officers or employees of KCS or its subsidiaries as provided in their respective organizational documents or in any agreement will
survive the transaction and will continue at and after the effective time in full force and effect. For a period of six years after the effective time, CPRL and

subsidiary’s organizational

documents as in effect immediately prior to the effective time or in any indemnification agreements of KCS or any of its subsidiaries with any of their
respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the effective time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of KCS or any of its subsidiaries; provided, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period will continue until the final disposition of such proceeding or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six-year
period. From and after the control date, CPRL will assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and will cause the
second surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, the indemnification and insurance covenants
contained in the merger agreement.
Each of CPRL and the second surviving corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses to) each current and former director, officer or employee of KCS or any of its
subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of KCS or its subsidiaries (which we refer to, together with such
person’s heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, collectively as the “KCS indemnified parties”) against any costs or expenses,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action
or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time. In the
event of any such proceeding, CPRL and the second surviving corporation will cooperate with the indemnified party in the defense of any such
proceeding.
For a period of six years from the effective time, CPRL and the second surviving corporation will cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by KCS and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the effective time; provided, that after the effective time, CPRL and the second surviving corporation will not be required to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by KCS prior to September 15, 2021 in respect of the coverage required to be obtained
pursuant thereto, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. KCS will purchase, prior to the effective
time, a six-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by KCS and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the effective time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and the purchase of such “tail” policy will be deemed to discharge
and satisfy the obligations of KCS and the second surviving corporation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence; provided, that KCS will not
commit or spend on such “tail” policy, in the aggregate, more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by KCS prior to the date of the merger
agreement for KCS’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, and if the cost of such “tail” policy
would otherwise exceed such limit, KCS will be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for up to such limit. CPRL and the
second surviving corporation will cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations under the policy to
be honored by the second surviving corporation, and no other party will have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance under the merger
agreement.
CPRL will pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any indemnified party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in the indemnification and insurance provisions contained in the merger agreement.
The rights of each KCS indemnified party under the merger agreement will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified
party may have under the organizational documents of KCS or

any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement as violative of any law, each of KCS, CPRL and the merger subs will cooperate in all respects with
each other and will contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any action, decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Voting Trust Agreement
Subject to the merger agreement, applicable law and to the rules, regulations and practices of the STB, the voting trust agreement may be modified or
amended at any time by CPRL and merger holdco in their sole discretion, including to reflect changes requested by the STB or CFIUS; provided, that:
•
prior to the effective time, the voting trust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of KCS unless such
modification or amendment is not inconsistent with the merger agreement and is not adverse to KCS or its stockholders and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the STB voting trust approval;
•
whether prior to or after the effective time, the voting trust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of
KCS if such modification or amendment would reasonably be expected to materially increase the liability exposure of the board of directors
of the second surviving corporation under applicable law; and
•
any modification to the Voting Trust Agreement would be submitted to the STB for review and approval and the STB would have authority
to compel amendment of the Voting Trust Agreement or compliance by the Trustee with any divestiture order or other directive.
No power of the second surviving corporation, CPRL or any of its affiliates provided for in the voting trust agreement may be exercised in a manner which
violates the merger agreement.

THE VOTING TRUST",202,203
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,THE VOTING TRUST,"THE VOTING TRUST
The summary of certain terms of the voting trust below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the form of the voting trust agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to the merger agreement, which is incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not provide all of the information about the voting trust
that might be important to you. You are urged to read the form of voting trust agreement carefully and in its entirety because it is the legal document
that governs the transaction.
Under the voting trust agreement, immediately following the post-closing contributions, merger holdco will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
trustee the certificates of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the second surviving corporation, creating an irrevocable voting trust in respect
of the trust stock. Upon depositing the trust stock, merger holdco will receive voting trust certificates representing the deposited shares (which we
collectively refer to as the “trust certificates”). In its capacity as the trustee, the trustee will be required to vote all trust stock as further described below.
Although merger holdco will remain the beneficial owner of the trust stock, CPRL and merger holdco will be unable to exercise control over KCS while the
trust stock is held by the trustee.
The voting trust agreement requires the trustee to vote all trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent
with the effectuation of, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and, until the STB has issued a final order approving the transaction
and common control of KCS by CPRL, against any proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction involving KCS but not involving CPRL
or one of its affiliates. On other matters (including the election or removal of directors), the trustee generally will vote the trust stock in the trustee’s sole
discretion, unless merger holdco, as the holder of a trust certificate, with the prior written approval of the STB, directs the trustee as to any such vote
with respect to the trust stock represented by such trust certificate. Under the voting trust agreement, the trustee is generally prohibited from exercising
the voting powers of the trust stock in any way that would create any dependence or intercorporate relationship between (i) CPRL or its affiliates, on the
one hand, and (ii) KCS or its affiliates, on the other hand, and is also prohibited from selling, leasing, assigning, transferring, alienating, pledging,
encumbering or hypothecating the trust stock and/or any major assets of KCS.
Pending the termination of the voting trust, the trustee will pay to merger holdco, as registered holder of the trust certificates, all cash dividends and cash
distributions on the trust stock. Under the voting trust agreement, and notwithstanding the foregoing, CPRL may at any time cause merger holdco to sell
or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the trust stock, subject to obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. With respect to any such sale or
disposal proposed, the voting trust agreement provides that the trustee must take all actions reasonably requested by merger holdco (including, without
limitation, exercising all voting rights in respect of the trust stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the
effectuation of, such sale or disposition by merger holdco). The voting trust agreement provides that, in the event the STB final approval is granted, or in
the event that the law is amended to allow CPRL or its affiliates to acquire control of KCS without obtaining STB final approval or other governmental
approval (and upon delivery of an opinion of independent counsel selected by the STB that no order of the STB or other governmental authority is
required), the trustee will transfer the trust stock to or upon the order of merger holdco, as registered holder of the trust certificates, and the voting trust
shall terminate.
The voting trust agreement provides that, in the event that there has been an STB denial, CPRL will use its reasonable best efforts to, directly or
indirectly, (i) sell the trust stock to one or more eligible purchasers, or (ii) otherwise dispose of the trust stock, during a period of two years after such STB
denial or such extension of the two-year period as the STB may approve. Any such disposition will be subject to the jurisdiction of the STB to oversee
CPRL’s direct or indirect divestiture of the trust stock. In connection with such an event, the trustee would continue to perform its duties under the
voting trust agreement and, if CPRL fails to so sell or distribute the trust stock during such period, the trustee will as soon as practicable sell the trust
stock for cash to one or
169Table of Contents
more eligible purchasers in such manner and for such price as the trustee in its discretion deems reasonable after consultation with CPRL. For purposes
of the voting trust agreement, an “eligible purchaser” is a person or entity not affiliated with CPRL and that has all necessary regulatory authority, if any,
to purchase the trust stock. CPRL must cooperate with the trustee in so disposing of the trust stock and the trustee must act in accordance with any
direction made by CPRL as to any specific terms or method of disposition, to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements of the terms of any STB or
court order. The proceeds of the sale or other disposition would be distributed to merger holdco (or, if applicable, one or more other wholly owned
subsidiaries of CPRL), as registered holder(s) of the trust certificates.
The voting trust agreement provides that the trustee will receive reasonable and customary compensation for all services rendered under the voting trust
agreement and will be indemnified by CPRL.
Neither the trustee nor any affiliate of the trustee may have (i) any officers, or members of their respective boards or directors, in common with CPRL or
any of its affiliates, or (ii) any direct or indirect business arrangements or dealings, financial or otherwise, with CPRL or any of its affiliates, other than
dealings pertaining to establishment and carrying out of the trust. During the term of the trust, the trustee will not own any stock or securities of CPRL or
any of its affiliates; provided that, the trustee may own interests in any independently managed diversified mutual fund that owns stock or securities of
CPRL and/or any of its affiliates. Neither CPRL nor its affiliates may purchase the stock or securities of the trustee or any affiliate of the trustee.
Subject to applicable law and to the rules, regulations and practices of the STB, until the voting trust agreement is executed, CPRL may amend the terms
thereof in its sole discretion; provided that (x) prior to the completion of the post-closing contributions, as described in the merger agreement, the voting
trust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of KCS unless such modification or amendment is not inconsistent
with the merger agreement, is not adverse to KCS and its stockholders and would not reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
receipt of the STB voting trust approval; (y) the voting trust agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of KCS if such
modification or amendment would reasonably be expected to materially increase the liability exposure of the board of directors of the second surviving
corporation under applicable law; and (z) any modification to the Voting Trust Agreement would be submitted to the STB for review and approval and the
STB would have authority to compel amendment of the Voting Trust Agreement or compliance by the Trustee with any divestiture order or other
directive. Following the execution of the voting trust agreement, the voting trust agreement may only be modified or amended by agreement executed by
the trustee, CPRL, merger holdco and any other registered holder(s) of the trust certificates (a) pursuant to an order of the STB, (b) with the prior approval
of the STB, (c) in order to comply with any order of the STB, or (d) upon receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the trustee and the registered
holder(s) of trust certificates that an order of the STB approving such modification or amendment is not required and that the amendment is authorized
under the merger agreement and is consistent with the regulations of the STB regarding voting trusts.
On May 6, 2021, the STB issued a decision indicating that it had conducted a full review of the voting trust submitted to the STB Staff in March 2021 and
granted approval for the use of the voting trust to consummate the transaction, subject to the condition that the voting trust agreement be modified to
prohibit the trustee from owning securities of CPRL or its affiliates during the existence of the voting trust. CPRL made the requisite modification. The
voting trust agreement proposed for use with the transaction is unchanged from that modified in respect to the STB’s May 6 decision.
On September 15, 2021, CPRL and KCS filed with the STB an Amended Notice of Intent indicating that they had entered a new agreement providing for
CPRL’s acquisition of KCS, that they would file an application seeking STB control approval on or shortly after October 20, 2021 and that CPRL intended
to indirectly acquire the shares of KCS prior to receiving control approval via the use of a voting trust that was substantially identical to that reviewed
and approved by the STB in its May 6 decision.
On September 30, 2021, the STB issued a decision confirming that the transaction described in the September 15 Amended Notice of Intent was the “same
transaction” that had been noticed in March 2021 and that the STB’s May 6, 2021 approval for CPRL’s proposed use of a voting trust to acquire KCS
applies to the voting trust proposed for use with the transaction agreed to on September 15.

On September 15, 2021, CPRL, surviving merger sub and first merger sub entered into the merger agreement with KCS. Following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to CPRL’s and KCS’s obligations to effect the transaction, including obtaining CPRL shareholder approval and KCS stockholder
approval and certain other regulatory approvals, (1) first merger sub will merge with and into KCS with KCS surviving the first merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately following the effective time, KCS will merge with and into surviving merger sub with surviving
merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL (together referred to as the “transaction”). Immediately following
the second merger and the post-closing contributions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of surviving merger sub, as successor to KCS, will be
deposited by merger holdco into the voting trust subject to the voting trust agreement, pending STB final approval.
Following the transaction, once STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, CPRL (through its wholly
owned subsidiary, merger holdco), would be permitted to acquire control of KCS, the voting trust would be terminated and CPRL (through merger holdco)
would acquire control over KCS’s railroad operations (which we refer to, together with the transaction, for purposes of the pro forma financial information
(as defined below), as the “acquisition”). Following the acquisition, the combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (“CPKC”).
Under the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to pay, on behalf of surviving merger sub (i) holders of KCS common stock issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount per share equal to the cash
consideration of US$90 in cash, without interest, and the share consideration of 2.884 CPRL common shares and (ii) holders of KCS preferred stock
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount
per share equal to the preferred merger consideration of US$37.50 in cash, without interest. The total purchase consideration, including the merger
consideration and preferred merger consideration, to be paid in the transaction by or on behalf of surviving merger sub, and including the amounts
remitted by and on behalf of CPRL in respect of the CN agreement termination payment and CN refund is estimated to be C$35.3 billion, based on the
CPRL common share price of US$71.62 and the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate at October 14, 2021 of 1.2372. An increase (decrease) of 10% in
the price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the merger consideration, and
correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase/(decrease) in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar
would cause a C$409 million increase/(decrease) in the estimated value of the cash consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill
and intangible assets.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 combine the historical consolidated statements of income of CPRL and KCS, after giving effect to the acquisition and other
adjustments (as defined below) as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2021 combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of CPRL and KCS, after giving effect to the acquisition and other adjustments as
if they had occurred on September 30, 2021. We refer to these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as the “pro forma financial information.”
Adjustments in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial information to align KCS’s income statement and balance sheet amounts to CPRL’s
presentation, CPRL’s and KCS’s transaction and related financing costs incurred and expected to be incurred, and the associated income tax impacts of
recognizing these costs are defined here as “other adjustments”. For the purposes of the pro forma financial information, all CP and KCS transaction and
related financing costs incurred, or to be incurred, to effect the acquisition, have been included in other adjustments on the basis that all such costs are
incurred to achieve the final acquisition as defined above.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP, with CPRL being the accounting
acquirer in the acquisition. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and will be different from the adjustments based on final acquisition accounting
when completed, and the differences could be material.
Following the closing date, and until STB final approval is obtained and CPRL (through merger holdco) acquires control of KCS, CPRL expects to account
for its 100% indirect equity ownership investment in KCS using the equity method of accounting. The pro forma financial information has been prepared
on the assumption that CPRL (through merger holdco) has assumed control of KCS as the ultimate outcome of the acquisition will be a business
combination of CPRL and KCS.
The pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments CPRL believes are necessary to present fairly CPKC’s pro forma results of income and
financial position following the completion of the acquisition as of and for the periods indicated. The pro forma adjustments are based on currently
available information and assumptions CPRL believes are, under the circumstances and given the information available at this time, reasonable, directly
attributable to the acquisition, and reflective of adjustments necessary to report CPKC’s financial condition and results of operations as if CPRL
completed the acquisition.

As at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020
1.
Basis of presentation:
On September 15, 2021, CPRL, surviving merger sub and first merger sub entered into the merger agreement with KCS. Following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to CPRL’s and KCS’s obligations to effect the transaction, including obtaining the CPRL shareholder approval and KCS
stockholder approval and certain other regulatory approvals, (1) first merger sub will merge with and into KCS with KCS surviving the first merger
as a wholly owned subsidiary of surviving merger sub, and (2) immediately following the effective time, KCS will merge with and into surviving
merger sub with surviving merger sub surviving the second merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPRL. Immediately following the second
merger and the post-closing contributions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of surviving merger sub, as successor to KCS, will be
deposited by merger holdco into the voting trust subject to the voting trust agreement, pending STB final approval. Following the transaction, and
once STB final approval and approval from other applicable regulatory authorities is obtained, CPRL (through its wholly owned subsidiary, merger
holdco), would be permitted to acquire control of KCS. The voting trust would be terminated and CPRL (through merger holdco) would then
acquire control over KCS’s railroad operations. Following the acquisition, the combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City.
Under the merger agreement, CPRL has agreed to pay, on behalf of surviving merger sub (i) holders of KCS common stock issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) an amount per share equal to
the cash consideration of US$90.00 in cash, without interest, and the share consideration of 2.884 CPRL common shares and (ii) holders of KCS
preferred stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger
agreement) an amount per share equal to US$37.50 in cash, without interest. The total purchase consideration to be paid in the transaction is
estimated to be C$35.3 billion, based on the CPRL common share price of US$71.62 and the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate at October
14, 2021 of 1.2372. An increase (decrease) of 10% in the price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the
estimated value of the total consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase
(decrease) in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would cause a C$409 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the cash
consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets.
Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, (1) each option to purchase shares of KCS common stock, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the merger consideration value over (b) the exercise price per share of KCS common stock of
such option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of KCS common stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the effective time,
less applicable tax withholding (if any) with respect to the payment of such cash; (2) each award of shares of KCS common stock granted subject to
any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time and was granted prior to March 21,
2021, will, at the effective time, be converted into the right to receive (i) the merger consideration in respect of each share of KCS common stock
subject to such KCS restricted share award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends
corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, less applicable tax withholding (if any) with respect
to the payment of such merger consideration or cash;
176Table of Contents
(3) each award of shares of KCS common stock granted subject to any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time and was granted on or after March 21, 2021, will, at the effective time, be converted into an award that entitles
the holder to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such
KCS restricted share award and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS
restricted share award (where each such cash-based award described in this clause (3) will have the same terms and conditions (including vesting
terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding KCS restricted share award, except that such award will vest in full upon a qualifying
termination); and (4) each award of performance shares that corresponds to shares of KCS common stock that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be converted into an award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive an amount
in cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS performance share award, with
the number of shares of KCS common stock subject to each such award equal to 200% of the target number of shares of KCS common stock
covered by each such award as of immediately prior to the effective time.
CPRL and CPRC have arranged a commitment for a bridge facility on the terms set out in the debt commitment letters that, if needed, will be
available to CPRC, through surviving merger sub, to fund the cash consideration payable to the KCS stockholders. The floating interest rate on the
bridge facility is assumed to be 4.5% and, if drawn, the facility will mature 364 days post closing of the transaction. CPRL anticipates CPRC issuing
a series of term notes with varying maturity dates that ultimately will be used to fund the cash consideration.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (the “pro forma financial information”) has been prepared for inclusion in
the proxy statement/prospectus which forms a part of the registration statement filed on Form F-4 with respect to CPRL’s common shares to be
issued in the transaction.
The pro forma financial information has been prepared from:
•
The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of CPRL as at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included in CPRL’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021;
•
The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of KCS as at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 included in KCS’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021;
•
The Consolidated Financial Statements of CPRL as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 as included in CPRL’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020; and
•
The Consolidated Financial Statements of KCS as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 as included in KCS’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Upon the closing, and only for the period that the outstanding shares of the capital stock of the second surviving corporation (as successor to
KCS) are held in the voting trust, CPRL will account for its 100% indirect equity ownership of the second surviving corporation using the equity
method of accounting. Once the STB has completed its review of the transaction and approved CPRL’s acquisition of control of KCS, CPRL will
consolidate KCS prospectively and CPRL will remeasure the equity method investment to fair value immediately before KCS is consolidated, with
any resulting gain or loss recognized in net income. As the ultimate outcome of the transaction, assuming receipt of STB final approval, will be a
business

Table of Contents
combination, the unaudited pro forma financial information presented in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared on the basis of a
business combination beginning at the assumed effective time of the transaction.
The pro forma financial information includes all adjustments necessary to be consistent with U.S. GAAP and in accordance with Regulation S-X
Article 11. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (the “pro forma balance sheet”) gives effect to the acquisition as if it
had occurred on September 30, 2021. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020 (collectively, the “pro forma statements of income”) give effect to the acquisition as if it
occurred on January 1, 2020.
The pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue or operational synergies or cost savings that may
be achievable in connection with the transaction contemplated therein.
The pro forma financial information may not be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the events reflected therein had been
in effect on the dates indicated or of the results that may be obtained in the future. The pro forma financial information should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of CPRL and KCS referred to above.
2.
Principles of consolidation:
The pro forma financial information has been prepared on the basis that CPRL will account for the acquisition as a purchase of KCS using the
acquisition method pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 805 “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Under the acquisition method,
assets and liabilities of KCS are recorded at their fair value on the date of the acquisition and the total consideration is allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The adjustments to the pro forma financial information are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of presenting the pro forma
financial information, which are necessary to comply with applicable disclosure and reporting requirements. The allocation of the estimated
consideration is pending finalization of various estimates, inputs and analyses. Since this pro forma financial information has been prepared based
on preliminary estimates of consideration and fair values attributable to the purchase of KCS, the actual amounts eventually recorded for the
purchase accounting, including the identifiable intangibles and goodwill, may differ materially from the information presented. Refer to note 4.
3.
Presentation currency:
CPRL’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars whilst the consolidated financial statements of KCS are presented in
U.S. dollars. For purposes of the pro forma financial information, the balance sheet of KCS has been translated to Canadian dollars at the September
30, 2021 foreign exchange rate and the statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021
have been translated to Canadian dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods.

Under the acquisition method, the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with
the exception of income tax, operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.
The purchase price allocation is preliminary and will change as a result of several factors, including:
i.
Finalization of the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed;
ii.
Changes in the Canadian - U.S. dollar and Mexican peso - U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates;
iii.
Actual number of shares of KCS common stock and KCS preferred stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
closing of the transaction;
iv.
The price of CPRL common shares at the closing date;
v.
Actual amounts paid to settle the outstanding KCS equity awards;
vi.
Actual transaction costs incurred by KCS; and
vii.
The remeasurement of the equity method investment in KCS that is held in the voting trust prior to the control date, which
remeasurement will occur immediately before CPRL acquires control of KCS.
a)
Consideration
The value of the CPRL common shares to be issued in the transaction of approximately US$71.62 per share is based on the closing price of CPRL
common shares as of October 14, 2021, with such date being a date reasonably in proximity to the date of preparation of the pro forma financial
information. The final purchase price equation will be based on the closing price of CPRL common shares on the date the transaction is completed.
183
Table of Contents
The number of issued and outstanding shares of KCS common stock was based on the shares outstanding at September 30, 2021 being 90,789,609
shares of KCS common stock and 214,542 shares of KCS preferred stock.
As part of the transaction, the outstanding KCS equity awards are settled in cash and stock. The preliminary purchase price equation is based on
an estimated payment to holders of the KCS equity awards of approximately C$240 million, net of the proceeds on the exercise of KCS stock
options (note 1).
An increase (decrease) of 10% in the price of CPRL common shares would cause a C$2,340 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the
total consideration, and correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets. A five-cent increase (decrease) in the Canadian
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would cause a C$409 million increase (decrease) in the estimated value of the cash consideration, and
correspondingly, in the estimated value of Goodwill and intangible assets.
b)
Fair value of non controlling interest
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the fair value of the interest held by others in Meridian Speedway LLC cannot be reasonably
estimated and has been currently reflected at the carrying amount. When CPRL has finalized its determination of the fair value of the non
controlling interest, the value ultimately determined could be materially different, with a corresponding impact on the amount of Goodwill and
intangible assets.
c)
Other assets
The value of the right of use assets, which is included in this financial statement caption, is reduced by C$1 million to equal the remaining lease
liability relating to these assets, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805. In addition, goodwill included in the accounts of KCS of C$17
million, which is reported in this caption, is eliminated.
d)
KCS transaction costs
Estimated transaction costs of C$149 million expected to be incurred by KCS have been added to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The
estimated transaction costs are preliminary and may change.
e)
Long-term debt
The change in value of Long-term debt reflects the adjustment to record the debt at its estimated fair value.
f)
Goodwill and intangible assets
At the date of preparation of this pro forma financial information, certain fair value adjustments have been made as identified above; however, the
fair values of KCS’s identifiable assets and liabilities assumed and the impact of applying acquisition accounting have not been fully determined.
After reflecting the fair value adjustments made herein, the excess of the total consideration over the recognized amounts has been presented in
Goodwill and intangible assets at C$30,349 million. Once detailed valuations and related calculations are completed, a material portion of this
amount could be attributable to Properties, Goodwill and intangible assets, Other assets, Other long-term liabilities, and the related Deferred income
tax balances.
g)
Historical shareholders’ equity
The historical shareholders’ equity will be eliminated as part of the acquisition.
184
Table of Contents
h)
Income taxes
The adjustment to income tax relates to the deferred tax impact of the pro forma adjustments to the balance sheet as a result of the preliminary
purchase price calculation. The adjustment to income tax is calculated at an estimated effective rate of approximately 21% for 2021, and mainly
relates to the fair value adjustment for long-term debt (see note 4(e)) and the elimination of the tax impact of the CN agreement termination payment
(see note 4(i)).
i)
Termination payments and reimbursements
The CN agreement termination payment and CN refund paid by CPRL to KCS in respect of KCS’s termination payments to CN (or an affiliate of CN)
totaling US$1,400 million (C$1,773 million) have been reflected as part of the consideration paid to acquire KCS (“the CN termination payments”).
Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of KCS is US$700 million (C$892 million) related to these payments. This amount is not
reflected in the liabilities assumed in the acquisition as it has been reflected as a cost of the acquisition.
5.
Other transaction accounting adjustments:
Explanations of the other transaction accounting adjustments to the pro forma financial information are as follows:
a)
Reclassification adjustments
Certain reclassification adjustments have been made to the pro forma financial information to make the presentation conform to the presentation
adopted by CPRL. At this time, CPRL is not aware of any material differences in accounting policies that would have a material impact on the pro
forma financial information. Following the acquisition, CPRL will conduct a review of KCS’s accounting policies in an effort to determine if there are
any additional material differences that require reclassification of KCS’s revenues, expenses, assets or liabilities to conform to CPRL’s accounting
policies and classifications. As a result of that review, CPRL may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that,
when conformed, could have a material impact on the pro forma financial information.
The following reclassification adjustments have been made in the pro forma financial information:
Pro forma balance sheet
•
Revised presentation of KCS operating lease right-of-use asset and the related lease liability to classify the amounts into the financial
statement captions used by CPRL.
•
Reclassified a portion of KCS’s “Other long-term liabilities” to Pension and other benefits liabilities to classify the amounts into the
financial statement captions used by CPRL.
Pro forma statements of income
•
CPRL has aggregated its revenue into a single financial statement caption for purpose of the condensed presentation used in the pro
forma statements of income.
•
CPRL includes foreign exchange (gain) loss in the financial statement caption titled other (income) expense. The foreign exchange
(gain) loss incurred by KCS has been reclassified into this caption.
185
Table of Contents
•
CPRL includes equity in net (earnings) losses from affiliates in the financial statement caption titled other (income) expense. KCS’s
equity in net (earnings) losses from affiliates has been reclassified into this caption.
•
CPRL does not include impairment or the write-off of software costs as a separate financial statement caption in the income statement.
The write-off of software development costs incurred by KCS has been reclassified into Purchased services and other expenses.
•
CPRL does not present restructuring costs on a separate financial statement caption in the income statement. The lease-related
restructuring costs incurred by KCS have been reclassified into Equipment rents and the compensation-related restructuring costs
have been reclassified into Compensation and benefits.
•
CPRL does not present a financial statement caption representing materials and other and amounts classified in this caption by KCS
have been reclassified into Materials and Purchased services and other.
b)
Transaction costs
At September 30, 2021, C$147 million of transaction costs were recognized in Purchased services and other by CPRL and its affiliates and C$96
million were recognized as Merger costs by KCS. These have subsequently been removed from the pro forma statement of income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and the amount of transaction costs incurred and expected to be incurred by CPRL and its affiliates of C$181
million and by KCS of C$243 million, throughout the various stages of the acquisition, have been recognized in the pro forma statement of income
for the year ended December 31, 2020 in Purchased services and other. This is to reflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.
CPRL’s Other expense (income) financial statement caption for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 includes C$295 million of which C$248
million related to changes in the fair value on foreign exchange forward contracts, bond locks and forward starting floating-to-fix interest rate swaps
associated with the anticipated acquisition of KCS and C$47 million related to bridge financing fees associated with the anticipated funding of KCS.
This amount and the associated deferred tax impact, have been removed from the statement of income for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 and reflected in 2020 along with additional amounts of C$4 million expected to be incurred by CPRL, as the pro forma statements of income
reflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.
Additionally, the pro forma balance sheet as at September 30, 2021 has been adjusted to include transaction costs expected to be incurred as at that
date of C$38 million by CPRL and C$149 million by KCS, as discussed above.
Included in KCS’s Merger costs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2021, is the C$876 million (US$700 million) CN agreement
termination payment made to CN. This amount has been eliminated from the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September
30, 2021.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, CPRL recorded a non-recurring, merger termination payment of C$845 million (US$700 million)
received in relation to the termination of the first merger agreement with KCS (i.e., the CP termination payment). This merger termination payment,
along with the associated current tax impact, has been removed from the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 and has been reflected in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as the pro forma statements of income
reflect the acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.
186
Table of Contents
The CN termination payments have been included as a cost of the acquisition (note 4 (i)).
The estimated transaction costs and tax deductibility are preliminary, may change and are non-recurring adjustments.
c)
Debt and finance expenses
Part of the consideration associated with the acquisition of KCS is the CN termination payments of US$1,400 million (approximately C$1,773 million
based on the US to Canadian dollar exchange rate as of the date that the termination payments were made). A portion of the termination payments
totalling US$400 million (C$506 million) were funded by existing cash resources with the remaining balance of US$1,000 million (C$1,267 million)
funded by short-term borrowings including commercial paper and a short-term loan facility that was established by CPRC and CPRL. The average
cost of such short-term borrowings is approximately 1%. Interest costs related to these facilities has been included in the pro forma statements of
income based on the assumption that CPRC and CPRL will continue to finance a portion of the CN termination payments through its short-term
borrowing facilities. Interest expense includes C$9 million and C$13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended
December 31, 2020, respectively, associated with these borrowings.
CPRL and CPRC have arranged a commitment for a bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of US$8.5 billion on the terms set out in the debt
commitment letters that, if needed, will be available to CPRC, through surviving merger sub, to fund the cash consideration payable to the KCS
stockholders for the preferred stock and the common stock, the cash settlement for the stock based compensation awards and approximately C$250
million of transaction costs associated with the transaction. The pro forma balance sheet includes an amount of C$10,516 million assumed to be
borrowed under this facility for these purposes. The floating interest rate on the bridge facility is assumed to be 4.5% and if drawn, the facility will
mature 364 days after closing of the transaction. Interest costs related to this facility have been included in the pro forma statements of income
based on the assumption that CPRC and CPRL will continue to finance the remaining cash consideration through the bridge facility for its full term.
Net interest expense includes C$355 million and C$473 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020,
respectively, associated with these borrowings.
Bridge facility fees expensed through Other (income) and expense associated with the bridge facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2021
of C$47 million have been removed in the pro forma statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the expected total
expense of C$51 million has been recorded as an Other (income) expense in the pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2020.
CPRL anticipates CPRC issuing a series of term notes with varying maturity dates that ultimately will be used, by surviving merger sub, to fund the
cash consideration. It is currently expected that term notes will be issued prior to consummating the transaction such that the bridge facility will not
be drawn. The impact of a 220 basis point (2.2%) increase (decrease) in the rate of borrowing, relating to funds drawn under the bridge facility,
would increase (decrease) interest expense by approximately C$231 million per annum.
The debt assumed upon the acquisition of KCS is recorded in the purchase equation at fair value. The change in fair value is amortized into Net
interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt instrument using the effective interest rate method. As a result, adjustments of
C$38 million and C$54 million have been recorded as a reduction of Net interest expense in the pro forma statements of income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.
187
Table of Contents
Upon the closing of the transaction, it is presumed that CP has designated all incremental U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings as a foreign currency
hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign exchange gains and losses, from the dates of designation, on the translation
of the U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings would be included in Other comprehensive income (loss).
d)
Income taxes
The adjustment to income tax relates to the deferred tax impact of certain pro forma adjustments to the statement of income calculated at a KCS
statutory rate of 21% for 2020 and 2021 for KCS related adjustments and a CP statutory rate of 26% for 2020 and 2021 for CP related adjustments.
The tax treatment of the pro forma adjustments is preliminary and may change.
e)
Depreciation and amortization expense
The excess of the total purchase consideration over the recognized amounts of net assets has been presented as Goodwill and intangible assets in
the pro forma balance sheet. No depreciation or amortization has been recorded in relation to this amount and the determination of the amount that
will be associated with depreciable and amortizable assets is not yet known. For every $1 billion recorded as depreciable and amortizable assets,
CPRL’s annual depreciation and amortization expense would increase by C$30 million, assuming a 3% depreciation and amortization rate. The
depreciation and amortization rate of 3% approximates CPRL’s estimated annual rate of depreciation and amortization. See the section entitled –
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 37.
f)
Post-transaction compensation adjustments
The pro forma statement of income includes various adjustments to Compensation and benefits expense as summarized in the table noted below.

Amounts related to cash-based retention payments, share-based retention payments and other payments, of C$69 million are shown as an increase
to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the pro forma balance sheet.
i) Share-based compensation
The vesting of certain share-based compensation arrangements of KCS are accelerated upon occurrence of the transaction. Share-based
arrangements that vest upon the closing of the transaction are reflected as part of the transaction’s purchase price (note 4).
Unvested KCS performance share awards will be converted into a cash-based award that entitles the holder thereof, upon vesting at the end of the
three-year requisite service period, to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value for each performance share award held
multiplied by a performance factor of 200%. The fair value of the KCS’s performance share awards attributable to pre-transaction service that
188
Table of Contents
will be assumed by CPRL as at the closing date is estimated at C$43 million, and forms part of the consideration paid by CPRL to acquire KCS. This
amount is included within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and in Other long-term liabilities on the pro forma balance sheet. The
compensation cost attributed to post-transaction services resulted in an adjustment to Compensation and benefits expense of C$6 million and C$34
million reflected in the pro forma statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020,
respectively.
ii) Cash-based retention payments
KCS has established a cash-based retention program for KCS employees. Each award granted pursuant to the retention program will vest and
become payable in two installments: (1) 25% on the earlier of (a) the date on which the closing date occurs and (b) February 21, 2022, and (2) 75%
on the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the date that CPRL acquires control of KCS and (b) June 1, 2023, subject, in each case, to the recipient’s
continued employment through the applicable vesting dates; provided, however, that if the recipient experiences a qualifying termination, then the
recipient will be entitled to any then unpaid portion of the recipient’s award.
The pro forma financial information gives effect to the acquisition of control of KCS, for income statement purposes, on January 1, 2020, as such,
the maximum amount payable under this retention program of C$67 million has been recorded in Compensation and benefits expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2020.
iii) Share-based retention payments
KCS has established a restricted share-based retention program whereby employees and officers have received 17,934 KCS restricted share awards
with a vesting period of not less than one year. In connection with the transaction, the unvested KCS restricted share awards will be converted into
a right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration value in respect of each restricted share award, and (ii) the accrued but
unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of KCS common stock subject to such KCS restricted share award, upon vesting. The pro
forma adjustment to Compensation and benefits expenses includes C$1 million and C$4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, associated with this retention program.
iv) Other compensation adjustment
Pursuant to the transaction, KCS employees who participate in the KCS annual bonus are eligible for an additional bonus payment that is based on
the achievement of the applicable performance goals at the greater of (1) target performance and (2) 130% of actual performance, but in no event
greater than 200% of target. An adjustment of C$11 million is reflected within Compensation and benefits expenses in the statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2020 representing the incremental bonus that would have been recorded had the adjustment been reflected in the
annual bonus plan for the 2020 calendar year. This adjustment will not recur in the statement of income beyond twelve months after the transaction.
g)
Cost savings and synergies
The pro forma financial information does not include adjustments to reflect any potential revenue synergies or cost savings that may be achievable
in connection with the acquisition.

This column includes KCS common stock, including restricted shares, beneficially owned by officers, directors, nominees for director and beneficial
owners of more than 5% of KCS common stock. In accordance with SEC rules, this column also includes shares that may be acquired upon the
exercise of options or other convertible securities that are exercisable or convertible on the record date, or will become exercisable or convertible
within 60 days of that date, which are considered beneficially owned. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the
percentage ownership of that person, shares subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person that are exercisable or
convertible on the record date, or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the record date, are deemed outstanding. These shares are not,
however, deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. In addition, under applicable law,
shares that are held indirectly are considered beneficially owned. Directors, nominees for director and executive officers may also be deemed to
own, beneficially, shares included in the amounts shown above which are held in other capacities. The holders may disclaim beneficial ownership of
shares included under certain circumstances. A list of KCS executive officers is included in KCS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and KCS’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021. See page i of this proxy

any CPRL shareholder meetings and will not be entitled to
vote at such meetings, except as required by law.

preferred stock are entitled to receive payment up to the
amount of the par value before any payment or liquidation
is made upon the common stock or new series preferred
stock. Holders of KCS preferred stock are entitled to one
vote per share on any matter brought before the

and to fix and determine the number of shares of preferred
stock of any series, to determine the designation of any
such series, to increase or decrease the number of shares
of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of
that series, and to determine or alter the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or
imposed upon any such series. As of the date of this
proxy statement, there are currently no shares of new
series preferred stock outstanding.
Variation of Rights
Attaching to a Class or
Series of Shares
Under the CBCA, the rights attaching to CPRL common
shares may be varied only through an amendment of CPRL’s
articles authorized by special resolution of CPRL’s
shareholders, including, if applicable, a separate special
resolution of the holders of the affected class or series of
shares in accordance with the provisions of the CBCA.
Under KCS’s certificate of incorporation, the board of
directors is authorized to issue up to 2 million shares of

Reduction of Share Capital
Under the CBCA, CPRL may, by a special resolution of CPRL
shareholders, reduce its stated capital for a class or series of
shares for any reason, provided there are no reasonable
grounds for believing that (i) CPRL is, or after the proposed
reduction of its stated capital would be, unable to pay its
liabilities as they become due, or (ii) after the proposed
reduction of its stated capital, the realizable value of CPRL’s
assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities.
Under the DGCL, KCS, by an affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the KCS board, may reduce its capital by
reducing or eliminating the capital associated with shares
of capital stock that have been retired, by applying some
or all of the capital represented by shares purchased,
redeemed, converted or exchanged or by transferring to
surplus the capital associated with certain shares of its
stock. No reduction of capital may be made unless the
assets of KCS remaining after the reduction are sufficient
to pay any debts for which payment has not otherwise
been provided.
Distributions and
Dividends; Repurchases
and Redemptions
Distributions/Dividends
Under the CBCA, CPRL shareholders are entitled to receive
dividends if, as and when declared by the directors of CPRL,
subject to prior satisfaction of preferential dividends
applicable to any preferred shares.
Under CPRL’s articles, subject to the rights of the holders of
any other class of shares of CPRL entitled to receive
dividends in priority to or rateably with the holders of CPRL
common shares, the CPRL board may in its sole discretion
declare dividends on the CPRL common shares to the
exclusion of any other class of shares of CPRL.
Under the CBCA, the CPRL board may declare and pay
dividends to the holders of CPRL common shares or CPRL
preferred shares provided there are no reasonable grounds
for believing that: (i) CPRL is, or would after the payment be,
unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; and (ii) the
realizable value of CPRL’s assets
Distributions/Dividends
Under the DGCL, KCS stockholders are entitled to receive
dividends if, as and when declared by the KCS board. The
KCS board may declare and pay a dividend to KCS
stockholders out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out
of net profits for the year in which the dividend is
declared or the immediately preceding fiscal year, or both,
provided that such payment would not reduce capital
below the amount of capital represented by all classes of
outstanding stock having a preference as to the
distribution of assets upon liquidation. A dividend may be
paid in cash, in shares of common stock or in other
property.
In addition, as described above, holders of KCS preferred
stock are entitled to certain dividends as set forth in the
KCS certificate of incorporation.
Repurchases/Redemptions
Under the DGCL, KCS may redeem or repurchase shares
of its own common stock, except that generally it may not

With respect to the payment of dividends and the
distribution of assets of CPRL in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of CPRL or the other distribution
of the assets of CPRL among its shareholders for the purpose
of winding up its affairs, the First Preferred Shares are
entitled to priority over both the Second Preferred Shares,
the CPRL common shares, and over any other shares ranking
junior to the First Preferred Shares. The Second Preferred
Shares are entitled to priority over the holders of the CPRL
common shares and over any other shares ranking junior to
the Second Preferred Shares.
Dividends cannot be declared and paid on Second Preferred
Shares or CPRL common shares or any other shares ranking
junior to the First Preferred Shares or Second Preferred
Shares without the consent in writing of all holders of the
First Preferred Shares or Second Preferred Shares
outstanding, as applicable, unless and until all dividends (if
any) up to and including any dividend payable for the last
completed period for which such dividend is payable on each
series of First Preferred Shares or Second Preferred Shares
outstanding, respectively, has been declared and paid or set
apart for payment.
Repurchases/Redemptions
Under the CBCA, CPRL may repurchase its own shares,
provided there are no reasonable grounds for believing that
(i) CPRL is, or would be after the payment for the purchase of
such shares, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due
and (ii) the realizable value of CPRL’s assets would after the
payment for the purchase of such shares be less than the
aggregate of CPRL’s liabilities and the stated capital of all
classes of CPRL’s shares
redeem or repurchase those shares if the capital of KCS is
impaired at the time or would become impaired as a result
of the redemption or repurchase of such shares. If KCS
were to designate and issue shares of a series of preferred
stock that is redeemable in accordance with its terms,
such terms would govern the redemption of such shares.
Repurchased and redeemed shares may be retired or held
as treasury shares. Shares that have been repurchased
but have not been retired may be resold by KCS for such
consideration as the KCS board may determine in its
discretion.
Purchases by Subsidiaries of KCS
Under the DGCL, KCS common stock may be acquired by
subsidiaries of KCS without stockholder approval. Shares
of such common stock owned by a majority-owned
subsidiary are neither entitled to vote nor counted as
outstanding for quorum purposes.

Under the CBCA, CPRL may purchase or redeem any
redeemable shares issued by it at prices not exceeding the
redemption price, or as calculated according to a formula,
stated in CPRL’s articles; provided CPRL may only purchase
or redeem its redeemable shares if there are no reasonable
grounds for believing that (i) CPRL is, or would be after the
payment for the purchase or redemption of such shares,
unable to pay its liabilities as they become due and (ii) the
realizable value of CPRL’s assets would after the payment for
the purchase or redemption of such shares be less than the
aggregate of CPRL’s liabilities and the amount that would be
required to pay the holders of CPRL’s shares that have a
right to be paid, on a redemption or in a liquidation, rateably
with or before the holders of the shares to be purchased or
redeemed, to the extent that the amount has not been
included in its liabilities.
Under the CBCA, neither CPRL nor subsidiaries of CPRL may
hold CPRL shares, unless it is holding such shares solely in
the capacity of a personal representative, or by way of
security for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the
ordinary course of business that includes the lending of
money.
Lien on Shares, Calls on
Shares and Forfeiture of
Shares
Under the CBCA, shares must be fully paid prior to issue,
and are non-assessable. CPRL shares will not be issued until
the consideration for the shares is fully paid in money or in
property or past services that are not less in value than the
fair equivalent of the money that CPRL would have received
if the shares had been issued for money. The determination
of whether property or past services are the fair equivalent of
monetary consideration will be made by the CPRL board.
Under the DGCL, KCS may issue the whole or any part of
its shares of common stock or preferred stock as partly
paid and subject to call for the remainder of the
consideration to be paid therefor. When the whole of the
consideration payable for shares of KCS has not been
paid in full, and the assets of KCS must be insufficient to
satisfy the claims of creditors, each holder of shares not
paid in full must be bound to pay the unpaid balance due
for such shares.

notice of and to attend all annual and special meetings of the
shareholders of CPRL and to one vote in respect of each

Number of Directors
Under the CPRL’s articles, the actual number of directors on
the CPRL board may be determined from time to time by
resolution of the directors, provided that the CPRL board
consists of at least five and at most 20 directors.
KCS’s by-laws provide that the number of directors
constituting its board of directors must not be less than
three nor more than 18, the exact number of directors to be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a
majority of the whole board of directors, and such exact
number must be 18 until otherwise determined by
resolution adopted by a majority of the whole KCS board.
The KCS board currently has ten directors.
Qualification of Directors
No person will be elected or appointed a director if the
person is disqualified from being a director under the CBCA.
A director ceases to hold office when the director ceases to
be qualified as a director under the CBCA or CPRL’s articles.
No person will be eligible for election as a director of CPRL
unless nominated in accordance with the nomination
procedures provided for in CPRL’s by-laws.
Nomination Procedures
Nominations of persons for election to the CPRL board may

Citizenship and Residency
of Directors
The CBCA requires that at least 25% of the directors of CPRL
(or if CPRL ever has less than four directors, at least one
director) must be resident Canadians.
Not applicable.
Election of Directors
Subject to the CBCA and CPRL’s articles, CPRL’s by-laws
provide that nominations of persons for election to the CPRL
board may be made at any annual meeting of shareholders, or
at any special meeting of shareholders if one of the purposes
for which the special meeting was called is the election of
directors.
Under the CBCA, the CPRL board has the ability to appoint
additional directors between shareholder meetings without
shareholder approval, provided that such additional number
does not exceed one third of the number of directors elected
at the most recent shareholder meeting.
Per the requirements of the TSX, CPRL has a majority voting
policy, which requires any director nominee who does not
receive at least a majority of votes in their favor in an
uncontested election to immediately tender their resignation
from the CPRL board. This policy does not apply to
contested elections in which the number of director
nominees for election is greater than the number of director

elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast, in person or by proxy, for or against each director by
the holders of outstanding shares of common stock or
preferred stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors; provided that if the number of nominees, as of
the time of mailing of KCS’s proxy statement with respect

votes cast. There are amendments to the CBCA pending that,
once in force, will require a majority voting standard be used
for uncontested elections of directors of distributing
corporations governed by the CBCA, such as CPRL.
Cumulative Voting
Under the CBCA, cumulative voting is only permitted if the
articles of a corporation specifically provide for it. CPRL’s
articles do not provide for cumulative voting.
KCS’s certificate of incorporation does not provide for
cumulative voting.
Vacancies
The CBCA generally allows a vacancy on the board of
directors to be filled by a quorum of directors, except a
vacancy resulting from an increase in the number or the
minimum or maximum number of directors or a failure to elect
the number or minimum number of directors provided for in
the articles. Any vacancy among the directors resulting from
an increase in the number of directors as so determined may
be filled by resolution of the directors.
The KCS board has the power to fill all vacancies and
newly created directorships by a majority of the directors
then in office.
Votes to Govern
At all meetings of the CPRL board, every question must be
decided by a majority of the votes cast. The chairman of any
meeting may vote as a director.
Under KCS’s by-laws, a majority of the KCS board at a
meeting duly assembled constitutes a quorum for the
transaction of business except as otherwise provided by
statute, KCS’s certificate of incorporation or by KCS’s by-
laws. The act of a majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present will be the act of the
KCS board. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the
directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum be present, without notice other than
by announcement at the meeting.
Duties of Directors
Under the CBCA, the directors of CPRL owe a statutory
fiduciary duty to CPRL. The directors have a duty to manage,
or supervise the management of, the business and affairs of
CPRL. In exercising their powers and discharging their
duties, the directors must: (i) act honestly and in good faith
with a view to the best interests of CPRL; and (ii) exercise the
care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person
would exercise in comparable circumstances. When acting
with a view to the best interests of CPRL, the directors
Under Delaware law, the directors of KCS owe a duty of
care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that
directors act on an informed basis after due consideration
of the relevant materials and appropriate deliberation. The
duty of care also requires that directors exercise care in
overseeing and investigating the conduct of corporate
employees. The duty of loyalty requires directors to act in
what they reasonably believe to be the best interests of
the company and its stockholders without any conflict of
interest. A party

the interests of shareholders, employees, retirees and
pensioners, creditors, consumers and governments; (b) the
environment; and (c) the long-term interests of CPRL.
Provided that the directors consider the interests of
stakeholders and make a decision that is reasonable in light
of the circumstances, Canadian courts will not generally
question the decision. Canadian courts will scrutinize the
process by which the directors make their decisions and the
apparent objectives of their actions. If business decisions
have been made honestly, prudently, in good faith, on
reasonable grounds, and on an individual basis, Canadian
courts will generally decline to substitute their own opinion
for that of the board of directors, even where subsequent
events may cast doubt on the directors’ determination.
Under the CBCA, the directors of CPRL may delegate their
duties to a managing director who is a resident Canadian or
committee of directors and delegate to such managing
director or committee any of the powers of the directors, or to
an officer of CPRL; provided, that the directors may not
delegate the power to:
(i)  submit to the CPRL shareholders any question or
matter requiring the approval of the shareholders;
(ii)  fill a vacancy among the directors or in the office of
auditor, or appoint additional directors;
(iii)   issue securities except as authorized by the directors;
(iv) issue shares of a series except as authorized by the
directors;

(vi) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares issued

challenging the propriety of a decision of a board of
directors typically bears the burden of rebutting the
applicability of the “business judgment rule”
presumption, which presumes that directors acted in
accordance with the duties of care and loyalty.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Delaware courts may
subject directors’ conduct to enhanced scrutiny of,
among other matters, defensive actions taken in response
to a threat to corporate control and approval of a
transaction resulting in a sale of control of the
corporation.
Under Delaware law, a member of the board of directors, or
a member of any committee designated by the board of
directors, must, in the performance of such member’s
duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the
records of the corporation and upon such information,
opinions, reports or statements presented to the
corporation by any of the corporation’s officers or
employees, or committees of the board of directors, or by
any other person as to matters the member reasonably
believes are within such other person’s professional or
expert competence and who has been selected with
reasonable care by or on behalf of the corporation.

Conflicts of Interest of
Directors and Officers
Under the CBCA, each of the directors and officers of CPRL
must disclose to CPRL, in writing or by requesting to have it
entered in the minutes of meetings of directors or of meetings
of committees of directors, the nature and extent of any
interest that he or she has in a material contract or material
transaction, whether made or proposed, with CPRL, if the
director (i) is a party to the contract or transaction, (ii) is a
director or an officer, or an individual acting in a similar
capacity, of a party to the contract or transaction, or (iii) has
a material interest in a party to the contract or transaction.
A director who discloses such a conflict of interest will not
vote on any resolution to approve the contract or
transaction, unless the contract or transaction relates
primarily to his or her remuneration as a director, officer,
employee, agent or mandatory of CPRL or an affiliate, is for
indemnity or insurance of directors of CPRL, or is with an
affiliate of CPRL.
Where CPRL enters into a contract or transaction with a
director of CPRL, or with another person or entity of which a
director of CPRL is a director or officer or in which a director
of CPRL has a material interest, the director or officer is not
accountable to CPRL or its shareholders if (i) disclosure of
the interest was made as described above, (ii) the directors of
CPRL approved the contract or transaction, and
Under Delaware law, a contract or transaction in which a
director has an interest will not be voidable solely for this
reason if (i) the material facts about such interested
director’s interest are disclosed or are known to the board
of directors or an informed and properly functioning
independent committee thereof, and a majority of
disinterested directors or such committee in good faith
authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the disinterested directors, (ii) the material
facts about such interested director’s relationship or
interest are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote on such transaction, and the transaction
is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
majority of shares entitled to vote thereon or (iii) the
transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified. The mere fact that an
interested director is present and voting on a transaction
in which he or she is interested will not itself make the
transaction void. Interested directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the
board of directors or of a committee that authorizes the
contract or transaction.
Under Delaware law, an interested director could be held
liable for a transaction in which such director derived an
improper personal benefit.

Despite the foregoing, even if a director’s interest is not

acting honestly and in good faith, such director is not
accountable to CPRL or to its shareholders in respect of a
transaction or contract in which the director has an interest;
provided, that:

Shareholders’ Disclosure
of Interests in Shares
CPRL shareholders are not required to disclose their interests
in shares of CPRL, except in limited circumstances, including
when nominating a candidate for election as a director,
making certain other shareholder proposals or requisitioning
a meeting of shareholders in accordance with each of the
CBCA and CPRL’s by-laws.
Under the U.S. Exchange Act, all beneficial owners of holders
of 5% or greater of CPRL’s outstanding share capital must
report their holdings to the SEC on “Schedule 13G” if the
holdings are passive and held not with an intent to acquire
control and on “Schedule 13D” if the holdings are non-
passive and held with an intent to acquire control.
In accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, a
CPRL shareholder is required to disclose their interest in
CPRL’s shares where such shareholder’s holdings equal or
exceed 10% of the voting rights attached to the voting
securities.
Neither the DGCL nor KCS’s certificate of incorporation or

the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive
payment of a dividend or entitled to participate in a
liquidation distribution or for any other purpose, other than
to establish a shareholder’s right to receive notice of or to
vote at a meeting, which record date must be not more than
60 days before the day on which the particular action is to be

directors pass the resolution in respect of the applicable
action.

shareholders entitled to receive notice of or vote at a meeting
of shareholders will be at the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the day on which the notice is given,

respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, which record
date must not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors,

Annual Meetings of
Shareholders
Under the CBCA, the CPRL board must call an annual
meeting of shareholders not later than 15 months after
holding the last preceding annual meeting but no later than
six months after the end of CPRL’s preceding financial year.

At an annual meeting, shareholders will receive the financial
statements of CPRL and the auditor’s report, elect directors
of CPRL and appoint CPRL’s auditor. All other business that
may properly come before an annual meeting of shareholders
or any business coming before a special meeting of
shareholders is considered special business. For special
business to be properly brought before a meeting, it must be
specified in the notice of meeting and include (i) the nature of
that business in sufficient detail to permit the shareholder to
form a reasoned judgment thereon; and (ii) the text of any
special resolution to be submitted to the meeting.
Under the DGCL, an annual meeting of stockholders is
required for the election of directors and for such other
proper business as may be conducted thereat. The

Calling Special Meetings
of Shareholders
Under the CBCA, the CPRL board may call a special meeting
of shareholders at any time. In addition, holders of 5% or
more of the outstanding shares of CPRL that carry the right
to vote at a meeting sought to be held may requisition a
shareholders meeting. The requisition must be sent to CPRL
and each of its directors and state the business to be
transacted at the meeting. The CPRL board must call a
meeting of shareholders to transact the business stated in
the requisition within 21 days of receiving the requisition;
otherwise the shareholder may call the meeting. The CPRL
board is not required to call a meeting upon receiving a
requisition by a shareholder if (i) the business stated in the
requisition is of a proscribed nature, (ii) a record date has
already been fixed and notice provided in respect of a
meeting, or (iii) the CPRL board has already called a meeting

KCS’s by-laws provide that special meetings of
stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called
only by the chair of the KCS board, the KCS board, the

record who have continuously held for at least one year
prior to the date such request is delivered to the KCS

quorum (as to such class or series) entitled to take action
with respect to that vote on that matter, except as
otherwise provided by law, KCS’s certificate of

brokers are counted as present for purposes of
determining a quorum.
Adjournment of
Shareholder Meetings
Under the CBCA, the shareholders may adjourn the meeting
if a quorum is not present at the opening of the meeting. If a
meeting of the CPRL shareholders is adjourned for less than
30 days it will not be necessary to give notice of the
adjourned meeting, other than by announcement at the
meeting that it is adjourned. If a meeting of CPRL
shareholders is adjourned by one or more adjournments for
an aggregate of 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned
meeting will be given as for an original meeting, in
accordance with the provisions of the CBCA.
KCS’s by-laws provide that if a quorum is not present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then
either (i) the chair of the meeting, or (ii) the holders of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in person or represented by proxy, will have
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a
quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any
business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
When a meeting is adjourned to another time and/or
place, unless KCS’s by-laws otherwise require, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, KCS may
transact any business which might have been transacted
at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
30 days or a new record date for stockholders entitled to

Amendments to Articles or
Certificate of
Incorporation
Under the CBCA, an amendment to CPRL’s articles requires
approval by special resolution, being a majority of not less
than two-thirds of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, in
respect of the resolution at a meeting of CPRL shareholders,
including, if applicable, a separate special resolution of the
holders of any separately affected class of shares in
accordance with the provisions of the CBCA.
Any proposal to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision of KCS’s certificate of incorporation, requires
approval by the affirmative vote of both a majority of the
members of the KCS board then in office and a majority
vote of the voting power of all of the shares of KCS’s
capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class. However, any
proposal to amend, alter, change or repeal the provisions
of KCS’s certificate of incorporation that would amend,

other vote or approval required by statute.
Amendments to By-laws
The CPRL board may, by resolution, make, amend or repeal
any by-law that regulates the business or affairs of CPRL.
Where the directors make, amend or repeal a by-law, they are
required under the CBCA to submit the by-law, or the
amendment or repeal of a by-law, to the CPRL shareholders at
the next meeting of shareholders and the shareholders may
confirm, reject or amend the by-law, by an ordinary
resolution. If the by-law, amendment or repeal is rejected by
the shareholders, or the directors do not submit the by-law,
amendment or repeal to the shareholders as required, the by-
law, amendment or repeal ceases to be effective and no
subsequent resolution of the directors to make, amend or
repeal a by-law having substantially the same purpose or
effect is effective until it is confirmed or confirmed as
amended by the shareholders.
The KCS by-laws may be amended, or new by-laws may
be adopted, by the KCS board at any regular or special
meeting of the KCS board, if such amendment or adoption
is approved by a majority of the entire KCS board.

Shareholder Suits
Derivative Action: Under the CBCA, a “complainant” (as
such term is defined in this table under “Oppression
Remedy” below) may apply to a court for leave to bring a
derivative action in the name and on behalf of CPRL or any of
its subsidiaries, or to intervene in an existing action to which
CPRL or any of its subsidiaries, for the purpose of
prosecuting, defending or discontinuing the action on behalf
of CPRL or its subsidiary. However, under the CBCA, no
action may be brought and no intervention in an action may
be made unless a court is satisfied that: (i) the complainant
has given notice to the board of directors of CPRL or its
subsidiary of the complainant’s intention to apply to the
court for such leave not less than 14 days before bringing
the application if the board of directors of CPRL or its
subsidiary do not bring, diligently prosecute or defend or
discontinue the action; (ii) the complainant is acting in good
faith; and (iii) it appears to be in the interests of CPRL or its
subsidiary that the action be brought, prosecuted, defended
or discontinued.
Under the CBCA, the court in a derivative action may make
any order it determines to be appropriate, including, without
limitation, an order authorizing the complainant or any other
person to control the conduct of the action, an order giving
directions for the conduct of the action, an order directing

Generally, KCS is subject to potential liability under the
federal securities laws and under Delaware law. Under the
DGCL, a stockholder may bring a derivative action on
behalf of the corporation to enforce the rights of the
corporation. Generally, a person may institute and
maintain such a suit only if such person was a
stockholder at the time of the transaction that is the
subject of the suit or his or her shares thereafter devolved
upon him or her by operation of law. The DGCL also
requires that the derivative plaintiff make a demand on the
directors of the corporation to assert the corporate claim
before the suit may be prosecuted by the derivative
plaintiff, unless such demand would be futile. In certain
circumstances, class action lawsuits are available to
stockholders. The DGCL does not provide for a remedy
similar to the oppression remedy under the CBCA;
however, stockholders are entitled to remedies for
violation of a director’s fiduciary duties under Delaware
common law.

(ii)  appointing a receiver or receiver-manager;
(iii)   to regulate CPRL’s affairs by amending CPRL’s articles

generally be enforceable elsewhere in Canada.
A judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in
the United States based on civil liability would not be

Limitation of Personal
Liability of Directors and
Officers
Under the CBCA, no provision in a contract, CPRL’s articles,
CPRL’s by-laws or a resolution of CPRL’s board of directors
or shareholders relieves a director or officer of CPRL from the
duty to act in accordance with the CBCA or the regulations
thereunder or relieves them from liability for a breach thereof.
No director or officer will be liable for the acts, receipts,
neglects or defaults of any other director, officer, employee or
agent, or for joining in any receipt or act for conformity, or for
any loss, damage or expense happening to CPRL through the
insufficiency or deficiency of title to any property acquired
by, for or on behalf of CPRL, or for the insufficiency or
deficiency of any security in or upon which any of the
moneys of CPRL are placed out or invested, or for any loss or
damage arising from the bankruptcy, insolvency or tortuous
act of any person with whom any moneys, securities or
effects are lodged or deposited, or for any loss, conversion,
misapplication or misappropriation of or any damage
resulting from any dealings with any moneys, securities or
other assets belonging to CPRL, or for any other loss,
damage or misfortune whatever which may happen in the
execution of the duties of the director’s or officer’s
respective office or trust or in relation thereto unless the
same happens by or through the director’s or officer’s failure
to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best
interests of CPRL and to exercise the care, diligence and skill
that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in
comparable circumstances.
KCS’s certificate of incorporation provides that, to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, a director of KCS
will not be personally liable to KCS or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a

the case may be, to the best interests of the other

above; provided, however, that the indemnifiable person will
repay the funds if the individual does not fulfill the above-
mentioned conditions.
An indemnifiable person is also entitled to indemnity from

not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and,

property of CPRL other than in the ordinary course of
business of CPRL, including an amalgamation (other than an
amalgamation with a parent or a subsidiary or an

to be approved by special resolution, being a majority of not
less than two-thirds of the votes cast, in person or by proxy,

related party transaction means, generally, any transaction
by which an issuer, directly or indirectly, consummates one
or more specified transactions with a related party, including
purchasing or disposing of an asset, issuing securities or
assuming liabilities. “Related party,” as defined in MI 61-101,
includes (i) directors and senior officers of the issuer, (ii)
holders of voting securities of the issuer carrying more than
10% of the voting rights attached to all the issuer’s
outstanding voting securities and (iii) holders of a sufficient
number of any securities of the issuer to materially affect
control of the issuer. A “business combination” means,
generally, any amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation,
amendment to share terms or other transaction, as a
consequence of which the interest of a holder of an equity
security may be terminated without the holder’s consent.
MI 61-101 requires, subject to certain exceptions, specific

required and, subject to certain exceptions, the preparation of
a formal valuation of the subject matter of the related party
transaction or business combination and any non-cash
consideration offered in connection therewith, and the

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS",262,263
KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN_20211103_DEFM14A_19625972_4325028.Pdf,HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS,"HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. KCS and some
brokers “household” proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have
been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or KCS that they or KCS will be householding materials to
your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to
participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and
wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account, or KCS if you hold shares directly in your name.
Written requests should be made to Kansas City Southern, 427 West 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105, Attention: Corporate Secretary, and oral
requests should be made by calling KCS’s Corporate Secretary’s Office at 1-888-800-3690.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES
Section 2.1 Effect of the Mergers on Capital Stock.
(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Surviving Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Surviving Merger Sub:
(i) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive (A) a number of
Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Share Consideration”), subject to Section 2.1(e) with respect to fractional Parent Common
Shares, and (B) $90.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration” and, together with the Share Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). All shares of
Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be
automatically cancelled and cease to exist on the conversion thereof, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry form (“Common Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a “Common Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including the
right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the Fractional Share Cash Amount) into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Common Book-Entry Share or Common Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i).
(ii) Treatment of Excluded Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is directly owned by the
Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), Parent or either Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time, other than shares held on
behalf of third parties, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the
“Cancelled Shares”). Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than
either Merger Sub) immediately prior to the First Effective Time, other than shares held on behalf of third parties, shall automatically be converted
into the right to receive such number of Parent Common Shares equal to (A) the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Share Price plus (B) the
Exchange Ratio (each such share, together with the Cancelled Shares, the “Excluded Shares”).
(iii) Conversion of First Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of First Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the First Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of First Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(iv) Conversion of Company Preferred Stock. Each share of Company Preferred Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time, but excluding Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $37.50 per
share in cash (the “Preferred Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Preferred Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the
Preferred Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(iv) shall be automatically cancelled on the conversion thereof and shall cease to
exist, and uncertificated shares of Company Preferred Stock represented by book-entry form (“Preferred Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Preferred Stock (each, a “Preferred Certificate”) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Preferred Merger

Table of Contents
Consideration into which the shares of Company Preferred Stock represented by such Preferred Book-Entry Share or Preferred Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iv).
(b) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of the Second Surviving Corporation,
Surviving Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Second Surviving Corporation or Surviving Merger Sub, (i) each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Surviving Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding, all of
which shares shall be held by Parent and which shall not be affected by the Second Merger and (ii) each share of common stock of the First Surviving
Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be paid with respect thereto, such that, immediately following the Second Merger, the Second Surviving Corporation shall be a direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent.
(c) Dissenters’ Rights. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with,
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such shares held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the First Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall thereafter be no longer considered Dissenting Shares under this
Agreement and shall be treated as if they had been converted into, at the First Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the
Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, without any interest thereon, in accordance with Section 2.1(a). At the First Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle, offer to settle or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands.
(d) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock or the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and/or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.
(e) No Fractional Shares.
(i) No fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in connection with the First Merger and no certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Common Shares shall be delivered on the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i). Each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger a fraction of a Parent
Common Share (after aggregating all shares represented by the Common Certificates and Common Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu of such fractional Parent
A-9
Table of Contents
Common Share, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down to the nearest cent) representing such holder’s proportionate interest in the
net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregated number of fractional Parent Common Shares
that would otherwise have been issuable to such holders as part of the Merger Consideration (the “Fractional Share Cash Amount”).
(ii) As soon as practicable after the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of all such holders of fractional Parent
Common Shares, effect the sale of all such Parent Common Shares that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration at
the then-prevailing prices on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE. After the proceeds of such sale have been received, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the applicable Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to each applicable holder and shall make such amounts
available to such holders in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The payment of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to such holders is not
a separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.
(iii) No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional Parent Common Share
that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration.
Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Merger Sub shall designate Computershare Investor Services
Inc. or a bank or trust company or similar institution selected by Parent to serve as exchange agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company
in writing (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the “Exchange Agent”). Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent
shall, on behalf of Surviving Merger Sub, deposit or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, (i) cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (A) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)(i) and (B) the aggregate Preferred Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv) and (ii) evidence of Parent Common
Shares in book-entry form representing the number of Parent Common Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Share Consideration deliverable pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)(i). Parent agrees to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Any such cash and book-entry shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred
to as the “Exchange Fund.”
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day following
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal with respect to Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) and Certificates (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only on delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually
reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) or Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable.
(ii) On surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the
A-10
Table of Contents
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall be required to promptly deliver to each such holder, the Merger Consideration or the Preferred
Merger Consideration, as applicable, into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant
to this Article 2 (together with any Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c)). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable on due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid.
(iii) The Exchange Agent, the Company, Parent and each Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable to holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment; it being understood that, provided that the representation and warranty of the
Company in Section 3.15(c) is true and correct as of the First Effective Time, no deduction or withholding shall be made under the Laws of Canada
(or any province thereof) from any such amounts (other than, for greater certainty, (A) any dividend or other distribution referenced in Section
2.2(c), and (B) amounts referred to in Section 2.3 that are attributable to personal services performed by the applicable payee in Canada or any
province thereof or by an applicable payee who is a resident, for income Tax purposes, of Canada) except to the extent that any such deduction or
withholding shall be required by a change in Law after the date of this Agreement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
timely paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.
(c) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the First Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Parent
Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) until such holder shall surrender such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section
2.2. After the surrender in accordance with this Section 2.2 of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into Parent Common Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)(i), the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount payable
to such holder pursuant to this Article 2) any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable
with respect to the Parent Common Shares represented by such share of Company Common Stock, less such withholding or deduction for any Taxes
required by applicable Law.
(d) Closing of Transfer Books. At the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the First Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Second Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter
of transmittal in order to receive the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article 2.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock on the first anniversary of the First Effective Time
shall thereafter be delivered, at the direction of Surviving Merger Sub, to Parent on demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock who have not surrendered their shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)) or Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, without any interest thereon, on due surrender of their shares.
(f) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, either Merger Sub, the First Surviving
Corporation, the Second Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock as of immediately prior to the date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall
cease to represent any claim of any kind or nature and shall be deemed to be surrendered for cancellation to Parent.
(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by
Parent; provided, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide, on behalf of Surviving Merger Sub, additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to or at the
direction of Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(e).
(h) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions deliverable pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in accordance with Section 2.1
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.
Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Company Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall, at the First Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any of (A) the Merger Consideration Value over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock of such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Parent shall or shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
deliver to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but no
later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company that is at least four Business Days after the First Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration Value shall be
cancelled at the First Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

(b) Each award of shares of Company Common Stock granted subject to any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions (each, a
“Company Restricted Share Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall, at the First Effective Time, become fully
vested and be converted into the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Share Award as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share Award. Parent shall or shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders of Company Restricted Share Awards the cash amounts and Parent Common Shares described in
the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but no later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company that is at least four
Business Days after the First Effective Time.
(c) Each award of performance shares that corresponds to shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Company Performance Share
Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall, at the First Effective Time, be converted into an award that entitles
the holder thereof, upon vesting, to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration Value in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Performance Share Award, with the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such award equal to
200% of the target number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by each such award as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(c), each cash-based award covered by this Section 2.3(c) shall have the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding Company Performance Share Award; provided, that the performance-based vesting
conditions shall no longer apply, the award will be subject only to service-based vesting, and each such award shall vest in full upon a Qualifying
Termination.
(d) Each share of director deferred stock (each, a “Director Deferred Share”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, shall, at the First Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent shall or shall cause the Second Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to deliver to the holders of Director Deferred Shares the cash amounts and Parent Common Shares
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but no later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company that is at least
four Business Days after the First Effective Time.
(e) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company, through the Company Board or an appropriate committee thereof, shall adopt such
resolutions as may reasonably be required in its discretion to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.3.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) or Section 2.3(c) to the contrary, but subject to Section 5.1(b), (i) to the extent
the terms of any Company Option, Company Restricted Share Award or Company Performance Share Award granted on or after March 21, 2021 and not in
violation of this Agreement expressly provide for treatment in connection with the occurrence of the First Effective Time that is different from the
treatment prescribed by this Section 2.3, or (ii) as mutually agreed by the parties hereto and a holder of any Company Option, Company Restricted Share
Award or Company Performance Share Award, then in each case, the terms of such Company Option, Company Restricted Share Award or Company
Performance Share Award, as applicable, shall control (and the applicable provisions of this Section 2.3 shall not apply).

Section 4.4 Reports and Financial Statements.
(a) Parent is a “reporting issuer” or the equivalent and not on the list of reporting issuers in default under applicable Canadian Securities
Laws in each of the provinces and territories in Canada. Since December 31, 2018, (i) Parent has filed or furnished all forms, statements, certifications,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since December 31, 2018
(the forms, statements, certifications, documents and reports so filed or furnished by Parent and those filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the “Parent SEC Documents”) and (ii) Parent has filed or furnished all forms, documents and
reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the Canadian Securities Administrators prior to the date of this Agreement (together with the Parent
SEC Documents, the “Parent Public Documents”). Each of the Parent Public Documents, in each case as of its date, or, if amended, as finally amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Canadian Securities Laws, as the case may be, and no Parent Public Document as of its
date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amended or superseding filing) contained, and no
Parent Public Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC or the Canadian Securities Administrators subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent has not filed any confidential material change report
with any Canadian Securities Administrators that, as of the date of this Agreement, remains confidential.
(b) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE
and the TSX. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and 13(k)(3) thereunder, or the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, since December 31, 2018, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any extensions of credit in
the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of Parent.
(c) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (or, if
any such Parent SEC Document is amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, such amended or superseding Parent SEC
Document) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective
dates thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto) and
were prepared in all material respects in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto).
Section 4.5 Internal Controls and Procedures.
(a) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Parent is recorded and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parent’s filings with the SEC and Canadian Securities Administrators and
other public disclosure documents.
(b) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that is
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent in all material respects, (ii) provide
A-32
Table of Contents
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent and that
receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Parent’s assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are used in the systems
of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting controls and procedures described above are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or its accountants, except as
would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect or disrupt, in any material respect, the Company’s systems of disclosure controls and procedures
and of financial reporting controls and procedures or the reports generated thereby.
(c) Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Parent
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Parent’s auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board, (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal control over financial reporting. As of the
date of its most recent audited financial statements, neither Parent nor its auditors had identified any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in its
internal controls over financial reporting and, as of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has come to its attention that has
caused it to believe that there are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal controls. To the Knowledge of Parent, since
December 31, 2018, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from
Parent employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent, since December 31,
2018, no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Parent’s
chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the Parent Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section
307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Parent policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

December 31, 2020 (the “Parent Balance Sheet Date”); or (f) as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither

of the Debt Commitment Letters. The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters and giving effect to any “flex”
provision in or related to the Debt Commitment Letters (including with respect to fees and original issue discount), together with cash and the other
sources of immediately funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the

any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are not subject to, or conditioned on, the receipt or availability of any funds or the Debt
Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited Company Alternative Proposal that did not result from the Company’s violation of this
Section 5.4, the Company and its Representatives may contact the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof. If (i) such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that such Company Alternative Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Company
Alternative Proposal (including its Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources) in response to a request therefor, if, and only if,
prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having confidentiality and use
provisions that, in each case, are not less restrictive in the aggregate to such third party than the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making
or amendment of any Company Alternative Proposal), provided, however, that if the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal is a known
competitor of the Company, the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to such third party in connection with any
actions permitted by this Section 5.4(b) other than in accordance with customary “clean room” or other similar procedures designed to limit the disclosure
of competitively sensitive information, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its Representatives) with respect to
the Company Alternative Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if: (i) any inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal are received by the Company or any of its Representatives or (ii) any information is requested
from the Company or any of its Representatives that, to the Knowledge of the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in
connection with any Company Alternative Proposal, which notice shall identify the material terms and conditions thereof (including the name of the
applicable third party and, if applicable, complete copies of any written requests, proposals or offers and any other material documents, including
proposed agreements). It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.4(b),
including any public announcement that the Company or the Company Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 5.4(b) to take
or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
developments regarding any Company Alternative Proposals or any material change to the terms of any such Company Alternative Proposal and any
material change to the status of any such discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.
(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, the Company Board, including any committee thereof, shall not (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is mailed by the Company to the stockholders of the Company; (iii) if any Company Alternative Proposal that is
structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of
A-48

Parent), fail to recommend, within ten Business Days after such commencement, against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders; (iv) approve, adopt, recommend or declare advisable any Company Alternative Proposal or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, or declare advisable any Company Alternative Proposal; or (v) approve, adopt or recommend, or declare advisable or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in and entered into compliance with Section 5.4(b)) with
respect to any Company Alternative Proposal (any such action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), a “Company Change of
Recommendation”). Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board may, in response to a Company Superior Proposal, (x) make a Company Change of Recommendation and/or (y) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); provided, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make such a Company Change of
Recommendation or cause any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) (A) unless the Company shall have given Parent at least five
Business Days’ written notice (a “Company Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Company Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Company Superior Proposal Notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of the
Company Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the Company Board, the identity of the Person making the Company Superior
Proposal and a copy of any proposed definitive agreement for such Company Superior Proposal, if any, and the Company shall have negotiated in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in connection with such Company Superior Proposal,
and (B) unless, at the end of the five-Business Day period following the delivery of such Company Superior Proposal Notice (the “Company Superior
Proposal Notice Period”), after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and any other
proposals or information offered by Parent during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board concludes that the Company
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Company Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if such amendments were
to be given effect; provided, that any material modifications to the terms of the Company Superior Proposal (including any change in the amount or form
of consideration) shall commence a new notice period pursuant clause (A) of three Business Days.
(d) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, but not
after, the Company Board may, in response to a Company Intervening Event, make a Company Change of Recommendation if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make such a
Company Change of Recommendation unless (i) the Company shall have given Parent at least five Business Days’ written notice (a “Company
Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Company Change of Recommendation, which Company Intervening Event
Notice shall include a description of the applicable Company Intervening Event and (ii) unless, at the end of the five-Business Day period following the
delivery of such Company Intervening Event Notice (the “Company Intervening Event Notice Period”), after taking into account any firm commitments
made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and any other proposals or information offered by Parent during the Company
Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board to make such Company Change of Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such amendments were to be given effect.
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying
with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or rules and policies of the NYSE, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
A-49

stockholders) or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
Board to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable
Law.
(f) Further to Section 5.4(a), the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to) promptly terminate any existing discussions and negotiations conducted
heretofore with any Person (other than Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives) with respect to any Company
Alternative Proposal, or proposal or transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Company Alternative Proposal. Further, the
Company shall promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such Persons and request that any such Persons
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and provide prompt written confirmation
thereof.

immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least 75% of the total voting power of the Company or the surviving entity (or any direct or
indirect parent company thereof), as applicable, immediately following such transaction, (ii) the acquisition by any Person of more than 25% of the net

considering all legal, financial, financing and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the identity of the Person(s) making the proposal and the likelihood of
the proposal being consummated in accordance with its terms, would, if consummated, result in a transaction (A) that is more favorable to the Company’s

taking into account any regulatory, financing or approval requirements and any other aspects considered relevant by the Company Board.

time that the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, (iv) to

represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, (iv) to comply with applicable Law or (v)
with the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of
the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the approval of the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter
(other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by Parent’s shareholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

(g) It is the intention of the parties hereto that, and each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause, the date and time of the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting be coordinated such that they occur on the
same calendar day (and in any event as close in time as possible).
(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting
pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be affected solely by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation, and Parent agrees that its obligations
to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be affected solely by the making of a Parent Change of Recommendation.
The Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be affected solely by the commencement of or announcement or disclosure
of or communication to Parent of any Company Alternative Proposal, and further, that it shall not terminate this Agreement on the grounds that such
Company Alternative Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, unless the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 7.1. Parent agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be affected solely by the commencement of or announcement or
disclosure of or communication to the Company of any Parent Alternative Proposal, and further, that it shall not take action to terminate this Agreement
on the grounds that such Parent Alternative Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal.
Section 5.7 Employee Matters.
(a) From and after the First Effective Time, the Company shall, and to the extent within its control, Parent shall cause the Company to, honor
all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the First Effective Time. For a period of one year following the
Control Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (“Company Employees”)
(i) base compensation and cash and equity target incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the First Effective Time (it being understood that in lieu of equity compensation awards, Parent may provide Company
Employees who, as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time were eligible to receive Company equity compensation awards, long-term incentive
awards that are settled in cash in an amount sufficient to replace the grant date value of the Company Employee’s equity compensation opportunity
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, provided, that, except as set forth in this Section 5.7(a), such long-term incentive awards shall have the same
terms and conditions as those applicable to the equity awards granted by Parent to its similarly situated employees), and (ii) employee benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to the Company Employee immediately before the First Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) Parent shall or shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose
employment terminates during the one-year period following the Control Date under circumstances that would give rise to severance benefits under the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (the “Company Severance Plans”), severance benefits in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Severance Plan in which such Company Employee is eligible to participate immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and (B) during such one-year period following the Control Date, severance benefits offered to each Company Employee shall be
determined taking into account all service with the Company, its Subsidiaries (and including, on and after the First Effective Time, the Second Surviving
Corporation and any of its Affiliates) and without taking into account any reduction after the First Effective Time in compensation paid or benefits
provided to such Company Employee.
(b) If the Control Date occurs before February 1, 2022, then no later than March 15, 2022, Parent shall, or shall cause the Second Surviving
Corporation to, pay to each Company Employee who participates in a Company annual bonus plan (or any successor plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries)
an annual bonus payment in respect of calendar year 2021 in an amount that is based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals at the
greater of (i) target performance and (ii) 130% of actual performance, but in no event greater than 200% of target. If the Control Date occurs on or after
February 1, 2022 but before February 1, 2023, then no later than March 15, 2023, Parent shall, or shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation to, pay to
each Company

Table of Contents
Employee who participates in a Company annual bonus plan (or any successor plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries) an annual bonus payment in respect
of calendar year 2022 in an amount that is based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals at the greater of (A) target performance and (B)
130% of actual performance, but in no event greater than 200% of target.
(c) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Control Date (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Control Date, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Control Date, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Control Date; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (x) for
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, (y) for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or (z) to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Control Date (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and any other insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Control Date, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at
the First Effective Time, as applicable.
(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose
or otherwise shall prevent Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee.

contemplated by this Agreement on the basis of such CFIUS Declaration, (iii) cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any other filings are
required to be made with, or Consents are required to be obtained from, or with respect to, any third parties or Governmental Entities, including under

(including the Second Surviving Corporation’s) assets (whether tangible or intangible), products, or businesses, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would otherwise have the effect of

requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order to sell, divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets, operations or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on or otherwise applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries only from and after the First Effective Time in
the event that the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than with respect to the STB Final Approval, which is discussed in Section
5.8(c), nothing in this Section 5.8 shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction in connection with obtaining any Parent Approvals that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Mergers (measured on a scale relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including pursuant to the authority granted to Parent under Section
5.8(e)), the Company, Parent and each Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to) take or agree to take any action that would be
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing. In the event that any information in the filings submitted pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) or
any such supplemental information furnished in connection therewith is deemed confidential by either party, the parties shall maintain the confidentiality
of the same, and the parties shall seek authorization from the applicable Governmental Entity to withhold such information from public view.
(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.8:
(i) each of Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, file the appropriate and necessary documentation for the
approval of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “STB Approval Application”) with the STB, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) make such filing within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement and (y) obtain, as promptly as practicable, the final and
non-appealable approval or exemption by the STB of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 11323 et
seq. (the “STB Final Approval”);
(ii) each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to (A) prosecute all such filings and other presentations
made, and promptly make any subsequent filings or presentations, with the STB with diligence, (B) diligently oppose any third party’s objections
to, appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen any approval, opinion, exemption or other authorization obtained from the STB, and (C) take all
such further action as in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Company may facilitate obtaining the STB Final Approval; and

(d) The Company, Parent and each Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
registrations, filings, notifications, communications, submissions and any other actions pursuant to this Section 5.8(d), and, subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and each Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly informing and
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received or given by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from or to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to
the exchange of information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and each Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any
documents submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity (except for any exhibits to such communications providing the personal identifying
information required by 31 C.F.R. Section 800.502(c)(5)(vi)

or that otherwise is requested by any Governmental Entity to remain confidential from the other parties); provided, that materials may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. The parties
shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 5.8 in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Merger Subs agrees not to initiate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone or videoconference, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.
(e) Subject to the obligations of this Section 5.8, Parent shall, acting reasonably, devise and implement the strategy and timing for obtaining
any Consents required under any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Parent shall, for the avoidance
of doubt, have the final authority over the development, presentation and conduct of the STB case. Parent shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining such Consents; provided, that Parent shall consult in advance with the
Company and in good faith take the Company’s views into account regarding the overall strategy and timing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
initiate any such discussions or proceedings with any Governmental Entity, or take or agree to take any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to
obtaining any Consents in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Parent.
(f) Subject to Section 5.17(a), applicable Law and to the rules, regulations and practices of the STB, the Voting Trust Agreement may be
modified or amended at any time by Parent in its sole discretion, including to reflect changes requested by the STB or CFIUS; provided, that (i) prior to
the First Effective Time, the Voting Trust Agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of the Company unless such
modification or amendment is not inconsistent with this Agreement and is not adverse to the Company or its stockholders and would not reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on the STB Voting Trust Approval, and (ii) whether prior to or after the First Effective Time, the Voting
Trust Agreement may not be modified or amended without the prior written consent of the Company if such modification or amendment would reasonably
be expected to materially increase the liability exposure of the board of directors of the Second Surviving Corporation under applicable Law. No power of
the Second Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of its Affiliates provided for in the Voting Trust Agreement may be exercised in a manner which violates
this Agreement.
(g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.8, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and the Merger Subs shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall
contest and resist any such Action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Action, decree, judgment, injunction or other
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 5.9 Takeover Statute. If any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition” or other form of anti-takeover statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs and the members of their
respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

on, any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such

statements are consistent with information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the
Company and/or Parent in compliance with this Section 5.10. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release as the first public disclosure of
this Agreement.
Section 5.11 Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Parent, each Merger Sub and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the Mergers and shall continue at
and after the First Effective Time in full force and effect. For a period of six years after the First Effective Time, Parent and the Second Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any Company
Subsidiary’s certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the First Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding (as defined below) pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six-year period. From and after
the Control Date, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Second Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.11.
(b) Each of Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and successors and assigns, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director,
A-61
Table of Contents
employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time. In the event of any such Proceeding, Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Proceeding.
(c) For a period of six years from the First Effective Time, Parent and the Second Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the First Effective Time; provided, that after the First Effective Time, Parent and the Second Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. The Company shall purchase, prior to the First Effective Time, a six-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the First Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the purchase of such “tail” policy shall be deemed to discharge and satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Second Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence; provided, that the Company shall not commit or spend on such “tail” policy, in the
aggregate, more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for the Company’s current
policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, and if the cost of such “tail” policy would otherwise exceed such
limit, the Company shall be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for up to such limit. Parent and the Second Surviving
Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Second Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.
(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11.
(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Second
Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.
(f) In the event that Parent, the Second Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Second Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.
Section 5.12 Financing Cooperation.
(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts, and each of
them shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts, to provide customary

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, none of the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this Section 5.12 that would: (i) require the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or any persons who are officers or

any action taken by them at the request of Parent or its representatives pursuant to this Section 5.12 and any information used in connection therewith.
(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.12 represent the sole obligation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the Debt Financing) to be
obtained by Parent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Debt Financing) by Parent any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be
performed by it under this Section 5.12 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b), unless such
breach is the primary cause of Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing at the Closing.
(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or any of its Affiliates obtained by Parent or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that Parent shall be
permitted to disclose such information to (i) the Financing Parties subject to their confidentiality obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters and the

with the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
Section 5.13 Debt Financing.
(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts, to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund the Financing Amounts,
including using reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including by (i)
maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the
“Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any
related fee letter) on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Definitive
Agreements within Parent’s control and complying with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters, in
each case in a timely and diligent manner.
(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters becomes unavailable regardless of the
reason therefor, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (B) Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to obtain as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing for any such portion from alternative sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with cash and the other sources of
A-65
Table of Contents
immediately funds available to Parent at the Closing to pay the Financing Amounts and that do not include any conditions to the consummation of such
alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing. To the extent requested in writing by the Company
from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing if there exists any actual or threatened
material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement and a copy of
any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Party with respect to any actual material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation
or termination by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. The foregoing notwithstanding,
compliance by the Parent with this Section 5.13 shall not relieve Parent of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Debt Financing is available.
(c) None of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement, termination or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (1)
decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would be less than an amount that would be required, when taken together with
cash or cash equivalents held by the Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing
Date, to pay the Cash Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration and all other cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement by Parent at the
Closing, (2) could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (3) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, or (4) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing; provided, that Parent may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify any of the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed such Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement, provided that (i) the addition of such parties would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent
Closing and (ii) such amendments do not (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
any original issue discount of the Debt Financing (or payment of fees having similar effect)) or (B) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent Closing;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify any of the Debt Commitment Letters to increase the
amount of commitments under the Debt Commitment Letters. Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent
shall provide a copy thereof to the Company (with only fee amounts and other customary terms redacted, none of which redacted provisions would
adversely affect the conditionality or enforceability of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, supplemented or
modified to the knowledge of the Parent) and, to the extent such amendment, supplement or modification has been made in compliance with this Section
5.13(c), the term “Debt Commitment Letters” shall mean the applicable Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section 5.13(c) shall not relieve Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Debt Financing is available. To the extent Parent obtains Alternative Financing pursuant to Section
5.13(b), or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the Debt Financing pursuant to this Section 5.13(c), references to the “Debt
Financing,” “Financing Parties” and “Debt Commitment Letters” (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to refer to such Alternative
Financing, the commitments thereunder and the agreements with respect thereto, or the Debt Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified
or waived.

by any of the parties hereto. In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent, either Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except
that: (i) no such termination shall relieve any party of its obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory
Termination Fee or the CN Termination Amount Refund, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to Section 7.3 or any of its other obligations
under Section 7.3 expressly contemplated to survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3; (ii) no such termination shall relieve any

and (iii) the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of the last sentence of Section 5.12(b) and the provisions of Section 5.3(d), Section 5.12(d), this
Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8 shall survive the termination hereof.
Section 7.3 Termination Fees.
(a) Company Termination Fee.
(i) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), or (C) (x) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Alternative Proposal (substituting in the definition thereof
“50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears) is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly
withdrawn at least two Business Days prior to, the Company Stockholder Meeting (a “Company Qualifying Transaction”), (y) this Agreement is
terminated by (1) the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) or (2) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), and (z) concurrently with or within 12 months after such termination, the Company (1)
consummates a Company Qualifying Transaction or (2) enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Company Qualifying Transaction and later
consummates such Company Qualifying Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent in consideration of the Parent disposing of its rights
hereunder (other than those rights set out in Section 7.2), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent, a fee of $700,000,000 in cash (the “Company Termination Fee”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such
withholding or deduction is required by Law, such payment to be made concurrently with such termination in the case of clause (A) above, within
three Business Days after such termination in the case of clause (B) above, or within three Business Days after the consummation of such
Company Qualifying Transaction in the case of clause (C) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(ii) If the Company is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of U.S. federal income Taxes under Section 1442 or
1445 of the Code from the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to the applicable
Governmental Entity and the Company shall pay additional amounts to Parent (“Parent Additional Amounts”) (such additional amounts to
constitute additional proceeds for the disposition by the Parent of its rights under this Agreement) as may be necessary so that the net amount
received by Parent (including the Parent Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount Parent would have
received if the Taxes had not been so withheld or deducted; provided, that the Company’s obligation to pay such Parent Additional Amounts shall
not apply to the extent that the obligation to withhold or deduct any amount from the Company Termination Fee arises solely as the result of
Parent’s failure to deliver to the Company, prior to the payment of the Company Termination Fee, a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-
8BEN-E establishing an exemption from withholding under the U.S.-Canada Income Tax Treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI. Furthermore, without
duplication of the foregoing sentence, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on Parent
under Section 881(a) the Code (together with any interest and penalties and expenses paid or payable by Parent with respect thereto) with respect
to the receipt of the Company Termination Fee other than Taxes in respect of which amounts have been fully deducted and remitted and Parent
Additional Amounts have been paid. The parties shall
A-73
Table of Contents
cooperate to minimize any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld in respect of the Company Termination Fee. At the Company’s reasonable
request and expense, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from the applicable U.S. Governmental Entity of any Taxes
in respect of which the Company has paid a Parent Additional Amount or indemnified Parent (or, if such refund cannot be obtained, to claim a
credit for such Taxes). Parent shall promptly pay the amount of any such refund or credit obtained to the Company, net of any costs, Taxes and
expenses borne by Parent with respect to such refund or credit; provided that Parent shall not be obligated to make any payment otherwise
required pursuant to this sentence to the extent making such payment would place Parent in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification or Parent Additional Amount and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or Parent Additional Amount with respect to such Tax had never been paid.
Parent and the Company agree: (i) to treat, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, payment of the Company Termination Fee and any Parent
Additional Amounts as giving rise to gain or loss attributable to the cancellation, lapse, expiration or other termination of a right or obligation with
respect to property which is (or on acquisition would be) a capital asset in the hands of Parent within the meaning of Section 1234A(1) of the Code,
and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. The
obligations described in this paragraph shall survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 7.2 or this Section 7.3(a), on the payment by the Company of the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund and the
Parent Additional Amounts as and when required by this Section 7.3(a), neither the Company nor any of its former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives.
(b) Parent Termination Fees.
(i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(b)(i), and at the time of such termination, (1)
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(d) (solely as a result of an injunction or Order entered or issued by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any
Railroad Law or Section 721) has not been satisfied or waived and (2) all of the other conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided, that such conditions were then
capable of being satisfied if the Closing had taken place) and no breach by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.8 has contributed
materially and substantially to the failure of the condition set forth in the preceding clause (1) to be satisfied or (B) Section 7.1(b)(ii) (solely as the
result of a final and non-appealable Order entered or issued by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any Railroad Law or Section 721), then Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company in consideration of the Company disposing of its rights hereunder (other than those rights set out in
Section 7.2), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company, a fee of $1,000,000,000 in cash
(the “Regulatory Termination Fee”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is
required by Law, with such payment to be made within three Business Days of such termination.
(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii), or (B) (x) after the date of this Agreement, a
Parent Alternative Proposal (substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears) is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn at least two Business Days prior to, the Parent Shareholder Meeting (a
“Parent Qualifying Transaction”), (y) this Agreement is terminated by (1) the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) prior to the receipt of
the Parent Shareholder Approval or pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) or (2) the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (z) concurrently with or
within 12 months after such termination Parent (1) consummates a Parent Qualifying Transaction or (2) enters into a definitive agreement providing
for a Parent Qualifying Transaction and later consummates such Parent Qualifying Transaction, then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Company in consideration of the Company disposing of its rights hereunder (other than those rights set out in Section 7.2), a fee of
A-74
Table of Contents
$700,000,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such withholding or
deduction is required by Law, such payment to be made within three Business Days after such termination in the case of clause (A) above, or
within three Business Days after the consummation of such Parent Qualifying Transaction in the case of clause (B) above; it being understood that
in no event shall Parent be required to pay both the Parent Termination Fee and the Regulatory Termination Fee or either of the Parent Termination
Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(iii) If Parent is required, pursuant to the provisions of Part XIII of the CITA, to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of
Taxes from the Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to the applicable
Governmental Entity and Parent shall pay additional amounts to the Company (“Company Additional Amounts”) (such additional amounts to
constitute additional proceeds for the disposition by the Company of its rights under this Agreement) as may be necessary so that the net amount
received by the Company (including the Company Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount the
Company would have received if the Taxes had not been so withheld or deducted. Furthermore, without duplication of the foregoing sentence,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on the Company under Part XIII of the CITA
(together with any interest and penalties and expenses paid or payable by the Company with respect thereto) with respect to the receipt of the
Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, and Company Additional Amounts, other than Taxes in respect of which
amounts have been fully deducted and remitted. The parties shall cooperate to minimize any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld in respect of
the Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee, including that the Company shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Parent to determine whether the Company is a “resident of the United States” and a “qualifying person” and/or whether it carries on business in
Canada through a “permanent establishment,” in each case, for the purposes of the U.S. – Canada Income Tax Treaty and the CITA. At Parent’s
reasonable request and expense, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from the applicable Canadian
Governmental Entity of any Taxes in respect of which Parent has paid a Company Additional Amount or indemnified the Company (or, if such
refund cannot be obtained, to claim a credit from the applicable Canadian or U.S. Governmental Entity for such Taxes). The Company shall promptly
pay the amount of any such refund or credit obtained to Parent, net of any costs, Taxes and expenses borne by the Company with respect to such
refund or credit; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment otherwise required pursuant to this sentence to the extent
making such payment would place the Company in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to
indemnification or Company Additional Amount and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed
and the indemnification payments or Company Additional Amount with respect to such Tax had never been paid. Parent and the Company agree:
(i) to treat, for Canadian federal income Tax purposes, the payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee and/or the Parent Termination Fee and any
Company Additional Amounts as being proceeds of disposition for the disposition by the Company of property consisting of its rights under this
Agreement, and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable
Law. The obligations described in this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Agreement. Except as otherwise set
forth in Section 7.2 or this Section 7.3(b), on the payment by Parent of the Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, and
the Company Additional Amounts as and when required by this Section 7.3(b), none of Parent, either Merger Sub or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further liability with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives.
(c) Refund of CN Agreement Termination Amount. If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or (ii) by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section 7.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent, in return of $700,000,000 remitted to the Company by
Parent in respect of the
A-75
Table of Contents
Company’s payment to CN of the “Company Termination Fee” (as defined in the CN Agreement) in connection with the termination of the CN Agreement
and the execution of this Agreement pursuant to that certain offer letter, dated as of September 12, 2021, from Parent to the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, an amount equal to $700,000,000 in cash (the “CN Termination Amount
Refund”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes, unless (A) Parent or the applicable Affiliate has failed to deliver to the Company
a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form, in each case, establishing that the CN Termination Amount Refund
is exempt from withholding or (B) such withholding or deduction is required by a change in Law after the date hereof (in which case the parties shall
reasonably cooperate to minimize any such required withholding or deduction), with such payment to be made within three Business Days of such
termination; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the CN Termination Amount Refund on more than one occasion.
(d) Acknowledgements. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of this Agreement
and that, without Section 7.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(b), the Company would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as
expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated seeking such payment), together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee,
the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect on
the date such payment is required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the
event that the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee becomes
payable by, and is paid by, the Company to Parent or Parent to the Company, as applicable, such Company Termination Fee and/or CN Termination
Amount Refund, as applicable with respect to Parent, or such Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable with respect to the
Company, shall be the receiving party’s sole and exclusive remedy pursuant to this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that none of the
Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is in consideration for a
disposition of the rights of the recipient under this Agreement and represents liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or
the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances (which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach by the other party of this Agreement) in which
the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties further acknowledge that the CN Termination Amount
Refund shall not constitute a penalty, but is a refund and return of amounts previously remitted or caused to be remitted by Parent to the Company, and is
payable as a consequence of the disposition of the rights of the recipient under this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that the right to receive
the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not
limit or otherwise affect any such party’s right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5.

EXHIBIT A
This VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT (“Trust Agreement”), dated as of [●], 2021, by and among Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, a Canadian
corporation (“Parent”), Cygnus Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Holdco”) and David L.
Starling (“Trustee” and, together with the Parent and Holdco, the “Parties” and each, a “Party”).
W I T N E S S E T H :
WHEREAS, it is intended that pursuant to, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [●], 2021
(the “Merger Agreement”) (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A), by and among Parent, Cygnus Merger Sub 1 Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub 1”) , Cygnus Merger Sub 2 Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub 1 (“Merger Sub 2”) and Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation (“KCS”), (i) Merger Sub 2 will merge
with and into KCS (the “First Merger”), (ii) immediately following the First Merger, KCS will merge with and into Merger Sub 1 (the “Second Merger”),
with the entity surviving the Second Merger being referred to herein as the “Company” and (iii) immediately following the consummation of the Second
Merger, Parent will cause the contribution of all of the outstanding common shares of the Company to Holdco in accordance with the steps set forth in
Section 1.8 of the Merger Agreement (such contribution, the “Contribution”, and, together with the First Merger and the Second Merger, the “Merger”),
as a result of which the Company will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco;
WHEREAS, it is intended that the consummation of the Merger will occur prior to any issuance by the Surface Transportation Board (the “STB”)
of any required approval for, or exemption of, Parent’s control of the Company;
WHEREAS, Parent intends, contemporaneously with the consummation of the Merger, to cause the deposit of all of the outstanding common
shares of the Company in an independent, irrevocable voting trust (the “Trust”) pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 1013 and STB precedent, in order to avoid any
allegation or assertion that Parent or any affiliate of Parent is controlling or has the power to control the Company prior to the receipt of any required STB
approval or exemption;
WHEREAS, the deposit of all of the outstanding common shares of the Company with the Trust is for the purpose of providing assurance that
each of Holdco and the Parent will satisfy its absolute or contingent obligation under ICCTA and STB rules and precedents to avoid premature control of
the Company pending STB review and approval of such control;
WHEREAS, pursuant to Decision No. 5 (Docket No. FD 36500) of the STB, dated May 6, 2021, Parent has obtained the approval of the STB to
deposit all outstanding shares of the Company into the Trust;
WHEREAS, neither the Trustee nor any of its affiliates has any officers or board members in common or any direct or indirect business
arrangements or dealings (as described in Paragraph 10 hereof) with Parent, Holdco, the Company or any of their affiliates;
WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to act as voting trustee pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the rules of the STB; and
WHEREAS, Parent, Holdco and the Trustee intend that the Trust formed herein be a trust described in subsection 248(25.2) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada).

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Appointment of Trustee. Parent and Holdco hereby appoint David L. Starling as Trustee hereunder, and David L. Starling hereby accepts said
appointment and agrees to act as Trustee under this Trust Agreement as provided herein.
2. Deposit of Company Trust Stock.
(a) Immediately upon the completion of the Merger, Parent and Holdco agree that Holdco will deposit with the Trustee the certificate or
certificates for all outstanding common shares of the Company (“Shares”). All such certificates shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
instruments duly executed for transfer thereof to the Trustee, and shall be exchanged for one or more Voting Trust Certificates substantially in the form
attached hereto as Attachment B (the “Trust Certificates”), with the blanks therein appropriately filled and showing Holdco as the registered holder of
the Trust Certificates. All Shares at any time delivered to the Trustee hereunder are hereinafter called the “Trust Stock.” The Trustee shall present to the
Company all certificates representing Trust Stock for surrender and cancellation of such certificates and for the issuance and delivery to the Trustee of
new certificates registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee. Parent, Holdco and the Trustee agree that the deposit of the Trust Stock with the
Trustee pursuant to this Section 2 shall not result in a change in the beneficial ownership of the Shares and shall not result in a sale, disposition, lease or
exchange with the Trustee of the Trust Stock.
(b) The Parties agree (i) to treat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each beneficial owner of Trust Certificates as the beneficial owner of
the underlying Trust Stock, (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with the treatment described in (i) on any tax return, in any tax proceeding or
otherwise except to the extent required by a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;
and (iii) to treat, for Canadian federal income tax purposes, the trust created by this Trust Agreement as a trust described in subsection 248(25.2) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) and to not take any position inconsistent with such treatment on any tax return, in any tax proceeding or otherwise.
3. Acquisition of Additional Shares or Securities. Parent agrees that immediately upon receipt, acquisition or purchase by it or any of its affiliates
of any additional Shares, or any other voting securities of the Company, it will deposit or cause to be deposited to the Trustee the certificate or
certificates representing such additional Shares or securities.
4. The Trustee’s Powers.
(a) The Trustee shall be present, in person or represented by proxy, at all annual and special meetings of shareholders of the Company so
that all Trust Stock may be counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings. The Trustee shall be entitled and it shall
be its duty to exercise any and all voting rights in respect of the Trust Stock either in person or by proxy or consent, as hereinafter provided, unless
otherwise directed by an order of the STB or a court of competent jurisdiction. Parent and Holdco agree, and the Trustee acknowledges, that the Trustee
shall not participate in or interfere with the management of the Company and shall take no other actions with respect to the Company except in
accordance with the terms hereof, the terms of the Merger Agreement, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any orders of the
STB. The Trustee shall exercise all voting rights in respect of the Trust Stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or
consistent with the effectuation of, the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In exercising the Trustee’s voting rights
with respect to the Trust Stock, the Trustee shall vote in accordance with, and to maintain in effect, the terms and intent of the Merger Agreement and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, including, but not limited to, the following: the Trustee shall not sell, lease, assign, transfer,
alienate, pledge, encumber or hypothecate the Trust Stock or any major assets of the Company or any right or interest therein, whether voluntarily or by
operation of law or by gift or otherwise, nor shall the Trustee cause the Company to merge or consolidate with or

Table of Contents
into any other entity, without the prior written authorization of Parent (other than in connection with a disposition pursuant to Paragraph 9). In addition,
until the STB has issued a final order approving the merger and common control of the Company by Parent, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Trust
Stock to cause any other proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction (including, without limitation, any consolidation, sale of all or
substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company) involving the Company, but not involving
Parent or one of its affiliates (other than in connection with a disposition pursuant to Paragraph 9), not to be effected. The Trustee shall vote all shares of
Trust Stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to dispose of Trust Stock in accordance with Paragraph 9 hereof.
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Trust Stock with respect to all matters, including,
without limitation, the election or removal of directors, voted on by the stockholders of the Company (whether at a regular or special meeting or pursuant
to a unanimous written consent) in the Trustee’s sole discretion, having due regard for the interests of the holders of the Trust Certificates as investors in
the Company, determined without reference to such holders’ interests in railroads other than the Company or its subsidiaries; provided that the Trustee
shall not vote the Trust Stock in favor of taking or doing any act which would violate any provision of the Merger Agreement (or impede the Company’s
performance thereunder) or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, or which if taken or done prior to the
consummation of the Merger would have been a violation of the Merger Agreement or the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of KCS.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 4 or any other provision of this Agreement, the registered holder of a Trust Certificate may at
any time — but only with the prior written approval of the STB — instruct the Trustee in writing to vote the Trust Stock represented by such Trust
Certificate in any manner, in which case the Trustee shall vote such shares in accordance with such instructions. In exercising its voting rights in
accordance with this Paragraph 4, the Trustee shall take such actions at all annual, special or other meetings of stockholders of the Company or in
connection with any action by consent in lieu of a meeting.
5. Irrevocable Trust. This Agreement and the nomination of the Trustee during the term of the trust shall be irrevocable by Parent and its affiliates
and shall terminate only in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 9 and 15 hereof.
6. Subject to Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b), the Trustee shall not exercise the voting powers of the Trust Stock in any way so as to create any
dependence or intercorporate relationship between (i) Parent and its affiliates, on the one hand, and (ii) the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand.
The term “affiliate” or “affiliates” wherever used in this Trust Agreement shall have the meaning specified in Section 11323(c) of Title 49 of the United
States Code, as amended. The Trustee shall not, without the prior approval of the STB, vote the Trust Stock to elect any officer, director, nominee or
representative of Parent or any of its affiliates as an officer or director of the Company or of any affiliate of the Company. The Trustee shall be kept
informed with respect to the business operations of the Company by means of the financial statements prepared by the Company and any reports and
other information when and as the Company would be required to file with the SEC by Sections 13(a) or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, if the Company were subject thereto, any other information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended and other public disclosure documents periodically filed by the Company and affiliates of the Company with the STB, copies of which
shall be promptly furnished to the Trustee by the Company, and such other periodic reports as the Trustee may request from time to time, and the Trustee
shall be fully protected in relying upon such information. The Trustee shall not be liable for any mistakes of fact or law or any error of judgment, or for
any act or omission, except as a result of the Trustee’s willful misconduct or gross negligence.
7. Transfer of Trust Certificates. All Trust Certificates shall be transferable on the books of the Trustee by the registered holder upon the
surrender thereof properly assigned, in accordance with rules from time to time established for the purpose by the Trustee. Until so transferred, the
Trustee may treat the registered holder as owner of the applicable Trust Certificates for all purposes. Each transferee of a Trust Certificate issued
hereunder shall, by acceptance thereof, assent to and become a party to this Trust Agreement, and shall assume all attendant rights and obligations.

each cash dividend or cash distribution as may be declared and paid upon the Trust Stock, pay the same over to or as directed the registered holder(s) of
Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee shall receive and hold dividends and distributions other than cash upon the same
terms and conditions as the Trust Stock and shall issue Trust Certificates representing any new or additional securities that may be paid as dividends
upon the Trust Stock or otherwise distributed upon the Trust Stock to the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates in proportion to their respective
interests.
9. Disposition of Trust Stock; Termination of Trust.
(a) This Trust is accepted by the Trustee subject to the right hereby reserved in Parent at any time to cause Holdco to sell or make any other
disposition of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock, whether or not an event described in subparagraph (b) below has occurred. The Trustee shall take
all actions reasonably requested by Holdco with respect to (including, without limitation, exercising all voting rights in respect of Trust Stock in favor of
any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of) any proposed direct or indirect sale or other disposition of
the whole or any part of the Trust Stock by Holdco. The Trustee shall at any time upon the receipt of a direction from Parent signed by its President and
Chief Executive Officer or one of its authorized officers designating the person or entity to whom Parent has directly or indirectly sold or otherwise
disposed of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock and certifying that such person or entity is not an affiliate of Parent and has all necessary regulatory
authority, if any be required, to purchase the Trust Stock (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely), immediately transfer to the person
or entity therein named all the Trustee’s right, title and interest in such amount of the Trust Stock as may be set forth in said direction. If any regulatory
authority or approval, including STB approval, is required for such transfer, Parent will not give any such direction unless and until such regulatory
authority or approval is obtained. If the foregoing direction shall specify all of the Trust Stock, then following transfer of the Trustee’s right, title and
interest therein, and in the event of a sale thereof, upon delivery to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates of the proceeds
of such sale, this Trust shall cease and come to an end. If the foregoing direction is as to only a part of the Trust Stock, then this Trust shall cease as to
said part upon such transfer, and distribution of the net proceeds therefrom in the event of sale, but shall remain in full force and effect as to the
remaining part of the Trust Stock. In the event of a direct or indirect sale of Trust Stock by Parent, the Trustee shall, to the extent the consideration
therefor is payable to or controllable by the Trustee, promptly pay, or cause to be paid upon the order of Parent the net proceeds of such sale on a pro
rata basis to the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates. It is the intention of this paragraph that no violations of 49 U.S.C. Section 11323 will result
from a termination of this Trust.
(b) In the event the STB Approval (as defined below) shall have been granted, then immediately upon the direction of Parent and the
delivery of a certified copy of such order of the STB or other governmental authority with respect thereof, or, in the event that Subtitle IV of Title 49 of the
United States Code, or other controlling law, is amended to allow Parent or its affiliates to acquire control of the Company without obtaining STB or other
governmental approval, upon delivery of an opinion of independent counsel selected by the Trustee that no order of the STB or other governmental
authority is required, the Trustee shall transfer to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the
Trustee, its right, title and interest in and to all of the Trust Stock then held by it in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements of this Trust
Agreement and not theretofore transferred by it as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof, and upon such transfer this Trust shall cease and come to an
end.
(c) In the event that there shall have been an STB Denial (as defined below), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, directly or
indirectly, (i) sell the Trust Stock to one or more eligible purchasers, or (ii) otherwise dispose of the Trust Stock, during a period of two years after such
STB Denial or such extension of that period as the STB shall approve. Any such disposition shall be subject to any jurisdiction of the STB to oversee
Parent’s direct or indirect divestiture of Trust Stock. At all times, the Trustee shall continue to perform its duties under this Trust Agreement and, should
Parent be unsuccessful in its efforts to directly or indirectly sell
A-100
Table of Contents
or distribute the Trust Stock during the period referred to, the Trustee shall as soon as practicable sell the Trust Stock for cash to one or more eligible
purchasers in such manner and for such price as the Trustee in its discretion shall deem reasonable after consultation with the Parent. (An “eligible
purchaser” hereunder shall be a person or entity that is not affiliated with the Parent and which has all necessary regulatory authority, if any be required,
to purchase the Trust Stock.) Parent agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting such disposition, and the Trustee agrees to act in accordance with
any direction made by Parent as to any specific terms or method of disposition, to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements of the terms of any
STB or court order. The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust
Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates
hereunder before paying to the holder its share of the proceeds. Upon disposition of the Trust Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 9(c), this Trust shall
cease and come to an end.
(d) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other provision herein contained, this Trust Agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2025,
and may be extended by the Parties hereto, so long as no violation of 49 U.S.C. Sections 11323 will result from such termination or extension. All Trust
Stock and any other property held by the Trustee hereunder upon such termination shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the
registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it
of the Trust Certificates hereunder before the release or transfer of the stock interests evidenced thereby.
(e) The Trustee shall promptly inform the STB of any transfer or disposition of Trust Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 9.
(f) Except as provided in this Paragraph 9, the Trustee shall not dispose of, or in any way encumber, the Trust Stock.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the STB issues a declaratory order that the termination of the Trust will not cause Parent or its
affiliates to have control of the Company, the Trustee shall transfer on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates
hereunder as then known to the Trustee, its right, title and interest in and to all of the Trust Stock then held by it in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Trust Agreement and not theretofore transferred by it as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof, and this Trust shall cease and come to an
end. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates hereunder before the release or transfer of the Trust
Stock evidenced thereby.
(h) As used in this Paragraph 9, the terms “STB Approval” and “STB Denial” shall have the following meanings:
(i) “STB Approval” means the issuance by the STB of a decision, which decision shall become effective and which decision
shall not have been stayed or enjoined, that (A) constitutes a final agency action approving, exempting or otherwise authorizing the
acquisition of control over the Company’s railroad operations by Parent and its affiliates, without the imposition of conditions that Parent,
by written notice to the Trustee, has deemed to be unacceptable, and (B) does not require any change in the consideration paid or to be
paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement or other material provisions thereof, or any change to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company, unless Parent, by written notice to the Trustee, has determined any such change to be acceptable to Parent.
(ii) “STB Denial” means (A) STB Approval shall not have been obtained by December 31, 2023, or (B) the STB shall have, by
an order which shall have become final and no longer subject to review by the courts, refused to approve the control referred to in clause
(A) of the definition of STB Approval.
A-101
Table of Contents
10. Independence of Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor any affiliate of the Trustee may have (a) any officers, or members of their respective boards or
directors, in common with Parent or any of its affiliates, or (b) any direct or indirect business arrangements or dealings, financial or otherwise, with Parent
or any of its affiliates, other than dealings pertaining to establishment and carrying out of this Trust. The Trustee hereby agrees that during the term of
the Trust, the Trustee shall not own any stock or securities of Parent or any of its affiliates; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall
not prohibit the Trustee from owning any interest in any independently-managed diversified mutual fund that owns stock or securities of Parent and/or
any of its affiliates. Neither Parent nor its affiliates shall purchase the stock or securities of the Trustee or any affiliate of the Trustee.
11. Compensation for Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable and customary compensation for all services rendered by it as
Trustee under the terms hereof, and said compensation to the Trustee, together with all counsel fees, taxes, or other expenses reasonably incurred
hereunder, shall be promptly paid by Parent.
12. Trustee May Act Through Agents. The Trustee may at any time or from time to time appoint an agent or agents and may delegate to such agent
or agents the performance of any administrative duty of the Trustee and be entitled to reimbursement for the fees and expenses of such agents.
13. Responsibilities and Indemnification of the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be answerable for the default or misconduct of any agent or attorney
appointed by it in pursuance hereof if such agent or attorney shall have been selected with reasonable care. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee
shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall be fully protected by acting in reliance upon any notice, advice,
direction or other document or signature reasonably believed by the Trustee to be genuine. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the sufficiency or
accuracy of the form, execution, validity or genuineness of the Trust Stock, or of any other documents, or of any endorsement thereon, or for any lack of
endorsement thereon, or for any description therein, nor shall the Trustee be responsible or liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or
rights of the persons executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver any such Trust Stock or other document or endorsement or this Trust
Agreement, except for the execution and delivery of this Trust Agreement by this Trustee. Parent agrees that it will at all times protect, indemnify and save
harmless the Trustee from any loss, damages, liability, cost or expense of any kind or character whatsoever in connection with this Trust, except those, if
any, resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee, and will at all times undertake, assume full responsibility for, and pay on a
current basis, but at least quarterly, all cost and expense of any suit or litigation of any character, whether or not involving a third party, including any
proceedings before the STB, with respect to the Trust Stock or this Trust Agreement, and if the Trustee shall be made a party thereto, or be the subject of
any investigation or proceeding (whether formal or informal), the Parent will pay all costs, damages and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, to
which the Trustee may be subject by reason thereof; provided, however, that Parent shall not be responsible for the cost and expense of any suit that the
Trustee shall settle without first obtaining Parent’s written consent. The indemnification obligations of Parent shall survive any termination of this Trust
Agreement or the removal, resignation or other replacement of the Trustee. The Trustee may consult with counsel selected by it and the opinion of such
counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted or suffered by the Trustee hereunder in good
faith and in accordance with such opinion.
14. Trustee to Give Account to Holders. To the extent requested to do so by Parent, Holdco or any other registered holder of a Trust Certificate, the
Trustee shall furnish to the Party making such request full information with respect to (a) all property theretofore delivered to it as Trustee, (b) all property
then held by it as Trustee, and (c) all action theretofore taken by it as Trustee.
15. Resignation, Succession, Disqualification of Trustee. The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by giving sixty
days’ written notice of resignation to Parent, Holdco and the STB. Parent shall at least fifteen days prior to the effective date of such notice appoint a
successor trustee which
A-102
Table of Contents
shall satisfy the requirements of Paragraph 10 hereof. If no successor trustee shall have been appointed and shall have accepted appointment at least
fifteen days prior to the effective date of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any authority or court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor trustee. Upon written assumption by the successor trustee of the Trustee’s powers and duties hereunder a copy of
the assumption shall be delivered by the Trustee to Parent and to Holdco, and the STB and all registered holders of Trust Certificates shall be notified of
such assumption, whereupon the Trustee shall be discharged of its powers and duties hereunder and the successor trustee shall become vested
therewith. In the event of any material violation by the Trustee of the terms and conditions of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall become disqualified
from acting as trustee hereunder as soon as a successor trustee shall have been selected in the manner provided by this paragraph.
16. Amendment. This Trust Agreement may from time to time be modified or amended by agreement executed by the Trustee, Parent, Holdco and
any other registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates (a) pursuant to an order of the STB, (b) with the prior approval of the STB, (c) in order to comply
with any order of the STB, or (d) upon receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee and the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates that an
order of the STB approving such modification or amendment is not required and that the amendment is authorized under the Merger Agreement and is
consistent with the regulations of the STB regarding voting trusts.
17. Governing Law; Powers of the STB.
(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND

given effect only to the extent permitted by such Act and regulations. In the event that the STB shall, at any time hereafter by final order, find that
compliance with law requires any other or different action by the Trustee than is provided herein, the Trustee shall act in accordance with such final order
instead of the provisions of this Trust Agreement.

jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (B) waives any objection to the laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (C) waives any
objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party, (D) consents to mailing of process or other papers
in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Paragraph 22 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (E) shall not assert as a defense, any matter or claim waived by the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) of
this Section 17(b) or that any order issued by the Chosen Courts may not be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts.
(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY BE IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISE OUT

Members of the Board:
We understand that Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the “Company”), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (the “Buyer”), Cygnus Merger Sub I
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Surviving Merger Sub”), Cygnus Merger Sub 2 Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Surviving Merger Sub (“First Merger Sub”, and together with Surviving Merger Sub, “Merger Subs”) propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated September 10, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger of
First Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Surviving Merger Sub, and the subsequent merger of the Company with and into Surviving Merger Sub (the “Second Merger”, and together with the
First Merger, the “Transaction”), with Surviving Merger Sub surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer. Pursuant to the
First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares
held in treasury or held by the Buyer, Merger Subs or the Company (in each case, other than shares held on behalf of third parties) or shares with respect
to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(collectively, “Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive (i) $90.00 per share in cash and (ii) 2.884 shares of common stock, without par
value, of the Buyer (the “Buyer Common Stock”) as set forth in the Merger Agreement (together, the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
1)
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company and the Buyer, respectively;
2)
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company and the Buyer, respectively;

Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and certain parties and their financial

Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the commitment letters from certain lenders, dated as of September 12, 2021 (collectively, the “Commitment
Letters”), Decision No. 5 (Docket No. FD 36500) of the Surface Transportation Board (the “STB Voting Trust Approval”), the form of Voting Trust
Agreement to be entered into among the Buyer, Cygnus Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and the Trustee (the “Voting
Trust Agreement”), and certain related documents; and
12)
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company and the Buyer, respectively, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to
the financial projections of the Company, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
Transaction, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. With respect to the financial projections of the Buyer, including
information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Transaction, we have assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial
performance of the Buyer, including following consummation of the Transaction. In addition, we have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among
other things, (i) that the Transaction will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (ii) that the
Buyer will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters, (iii) that the Surface Transportation Board will permit the
Transaction to close into a Voting Trust in accordance with the terms of the STB Voting Trust Approval and the Voting Trust Agreement and (iv) that the
definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Transaction, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the
proposed Transaction. We have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of the Company and the Buyer of: (i)
the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the Transaction; (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company
and the Buyer; (iii) their ability to retain key employees of the Company and the Buyer, respectively, and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, the
Company and the Buyer’s existing and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. We

are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the
Buyer and the Company and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to
the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative
to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction. This opinion does not address the
relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement or proceed with any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. We express no opinion with respect to the treatment of the preferred stock, par value $25 per share,
of the Company in the Transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company or the Buyer, nor
have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as
in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the
assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which was paid to us upon the execution and announcement of the previous merger agreement with the Buyer in March 2021, a portion of
which was paid to us upon the rendering of a fairness opinion in connection with the alternate transaction involving Canadian National Railway
Company announced in May 2021, a portion of which is contingent upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent
upon the closing of the Transaction. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and/or financing services to the
Company, the Buyer and certain of their respective affiliates, and have received fees in connection with such services. In addition, Morgan Stanley or one
of its affiliates is currently a lender to each of the Company and the Buyer under their respective revolving credit facilities, and is also currently engaged
to provide financing services to the Buyer that are unrelated to the Transaction, for which Morgan Stanley expects to receive customary fees. Morgan
Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Company, the Buyer and their respective affiliates in the future and
would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management
businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and
derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,
directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the
Buyer, the Company, their respective affiliates or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Transaction, or any
related derivative instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary
practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without
our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, this opinion does not
in any manner address the prices at which the Buyer Common Stock will trade following consummation of the Transaction or at any time and Morgan
Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the Company or the Buyer should vote at the shareholder meetings to be
held in connection with the Transaction.

the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (collectively,
“Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive (i) $90.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 2.884 shares (the “Stock

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Kansas City Southern (“KCS”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), among KCS,
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (“CP”), Cygnus Merger Sub 1 Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of CP (“Surviving Merger Sub”) and Cygnus
Merger Sub 2 Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Surviving Merger Sub (“First Merger Sub”, and together with Surviving Merger Sub, “Merger

as a wholly owned subsidiary of Surviving Merger Sub, and immediately thereafter KCS will merge with and into Surviving Merger Sub (the “Second

of CP. Pursuant to the First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of KCS (the “KCS Common Stock”), other than
shares held in treasury or held by CP, Merger Subs or KCS (in each case, other than shares held on behalf of third parties) or shares with respect to which
the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (collectively,
“Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive (i) $90.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 2.884 shares (the “Stock

as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of KCS Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) of
the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Transaction.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
(1)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to KCS and CP;
(2)
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of KCS furnished to or
discussed with us by the management of KCS, including certain financial forecasts relating to KCS prepared by the management of KCS
(such forecasts, the “KCS Forecasts”);

discussed with us by the management of KCS, including certain financial forecasts relating to CP prepared by the management of KCS (such
forecasts, the “CP Forecasts”);
(4)
reviewed certain estimates as to the amount and timing of cost savings and revenue enhancements (collectively, the “Synergies”)
anticipated by the managements of KCS and CP to result from the Transaction;
(5)
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of KCS with members of senior managements of
KCS and CP, and discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of CP with members of senior
managements of KCS and CP;
(6)
reviewed the trading histories for KCS Common Stock and CP Common Stock and a comparison of such trading histories with the trading
histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
(7)
compared certain financial and stock market information of KCS and CP with similar information of other companies we deemed relevant;
(8)
compared certain financial terms of the Transaction to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions we deemed
relevant;
(9)
reviewed a draft dated September 10, 2021 of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”), commitment letters from certain lenders, dated
as of September 12, 2021 (collectively, the “Commitment Letters”), Decision No. 5 (Docket No. FD 36500) of the Surface Transportation
Board (the “STB Voting Trust Approval”) and the form of Voting Trust Agreement to be entered into among CP, Cygnus Holding
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of CP, and the Trustee (the “Voting Trust Agreement”), and certain related documents; and
(10)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the
managements of KCS and CP that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in
any material respect. With respect to the KCS Forecasts, we have been advised by KCS, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of KCS as to the future financial performance of KCS.
With respect to the CP Forecasts and Synergies, we have been advised by KCS, and have assumed, with the consent of KCS, that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of KCS as to the future
financial performance of CP and other matters covered thereby. We have relied, at the direction of KCS, on the assessments of the managements of KCS
and CP, respectively, as to CP’s ability to achieve the Synergies and have been advised by KCS and CP, and have assumed, with the consent of KCS, that
the Synergies will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of KCS or CP, nor
have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of KCS or CP. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of KCS or CP under any
state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of KCS, that the Transaction will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition
or other agreement contemplated therein or thereby and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals,
consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on KCS, CP or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We have also assumed, at
the direction of KCS, that (i) the Transaction will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (ii) CP will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters, (iii) the Surface
Transportation Board will permit the Transaction to close into a Voting Trust in accordance with the terms of the STB Voting Trust Approval and the
Voting Trust Agreement and (iv) the final executed Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Transaction (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein),
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of KCS Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Transaction and no opinion or view is
expressed with respect to any consideration to be received by the holders of the preferred stock, par value $25 per share, of KCS or any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise)
of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Transaction, or class of
such persons, relative to the Consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Transaction in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to KCS or in which KCS might engage or as to the underlying business decision of KCS to
proceed with or effect the Transaction. We are not expressing any opinion as to what the value of CP Common Stock actually will be when issued or the
prices at which KCS Common Stock or CP Common Stock will trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the Transaction.
In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Transaction or any related
matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to KCS in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which was paid to us
upon delivery of our opinion in connection with the previously proposed acquisition of KCS by CP announced in March 2021, a portion of which was
paid upon delivery of our opinion in connection with the alternate proposed transaction involving Canadian National Railway Company announced in
May 2021, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the
Transaction. In addition, KCS has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

made available to us as of, the date hereof. As you are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we
express no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on KCS, CP or the Transaction. It should be understood that subsequent
developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. The issuance of this opinion was
approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities, Inc.
