from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment,
compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to persons seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon
the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation
is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity
of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of
legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights,
such person must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to ForgeRock before the vote is taken on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement; (3) continue to hold of record or own beneficially the subject shares of our common stock through the
effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the
DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal
rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings with respect of ForgeRock
unless certain conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking appraisal, as described further below. The requirements
under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement,
which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL. Pursuant to Subsection (d)(1) of Section 262

Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and extensions thereof, if any)
applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (which we refer to as the
“HSR Act”) have expired or otherwise been terminated, and all consents, approvals and filings required under the
specified foreign regulatory laws (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger”), which include filings under foreign direct investment laws (which
we refer to as “FDI” laws), have been obtained or made.
ForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(which we refer to as the “DOJ”) on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified
the FTC and the DOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R.
803.12 of the HSR Act in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent’s notification and
report form was withdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form on
November 28, 2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting period commenced under the HSR Act. Both before and after
the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on
antitrust grounds.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock, submitted the specified FDI filings on October
31, 2022.

herein, from a third party. The voting agreements also contain restrictions on the transfer of shares of our common
stock held by the stockholders party thereto, subject to certain exceptions.

From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger
agreement) (which we refer to as the “no-shop period”) ForgeRock agreed to, and agreed to (1) cause its subsidiaries
and its executive officers and directors, (2) instruct its legal and financial advisors and (3) use reasonable best efforts
to cause each of its representatives to, in each case, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to diligence) of any person and its
representatives relating to an acquisition transaction.
In particular, under and subject to the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the
earlier to occur of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, ForgeRock, its
subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers, will not, and ForgeRock will not authorize or direct
any of its and its subsidiaries’ other employees, consultants or other representatives to, directly or indirectly:

proposal;

any non-public information relating to ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person or
group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective representatives) access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of ForgeRock or
any of its subsidiaries, in any such case in connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to

respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third persons relating to the making
of an acquisition proposal, subject to certain exceptions under the merger agreement;

acquisition proposal;
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other contract relating to an acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement (we
refer to any of these as an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or
•
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, ForgeRock and the ForgeRock Board
(or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives (including its financial
advisor), (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) subject to an acceptable confidentiality

or any of its subsidiaries to; or (3) otherwise facilitate the making of a superior proposal by, in each case, any person
or group or their respective representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to ForgeRock an acquisition
proposal after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in material breach of the applicable restrictions.
ForgeRock and the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) may only take the foregoing actions if the ForgeRock
Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that (A) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead
to a superior proposal; and (B) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
ForgeRock is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless
it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with
Parent during a specified period. If ForgeRock terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal
from a third party, it must pay a termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy

On November 28, 2022, an individual action was filed against ForgeRock, the current members of the ForgeRock
Board, and former ForgeRock directors David DeWalt and Paul Madera by a purported ForgeRock stockholder in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. That action is captioned O’Dell v. ForgeRock, Inc., et al.,
No. 1:22-cv-10077-ALC (which we refer to as the “stockholder litigation”). The complaint generally alleges that
ForgeRock’s preliminary proxy statement contained false or misleading statements regarding the merger in violation
of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the
preliminary proxy statement contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning the financial
projections prepared by ForgeRock management and the financial analysis performed by J.P. Morgan in connection
with rendering its fairness opinion. The action seeks, among other things, to (1) enjoin defendants from
consummating the merger unless and until defendants disseminate revised disclosures; (2) rescind the merger and
recover damages; and (3) reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses.
ForgeRock believes that the stockholder litigation is without merit, but there can be no assurance that ForgeRock will
ultimately prevail in the stockholder litigation or other such lawsuits. Additional lawsuits may be filed before the

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger
agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to
you. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement,
including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this proxy statement. You

instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On October 10, 2022, we announced that ForgeRock entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger
agreement, Parent will acquire ForgeRock for $23.25 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete
the merger, our stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of
our common stock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This
approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The ForgeRock Board is furnishing this
proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the
solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the
merger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed
materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without attending the special
meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy
as soon as possible.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on ForgeRock?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of ForgeRock by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is
approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock, with ForgeRock continuing as the surviving
corporation. As a result of the merger, ForgeRock will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our
Class A common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our
Class A common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports
with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $23.25 in cash (subject to certain exceptions),
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own,
unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under
the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our
common stock, you will receive $2,325 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of ForgeRock’s Class A common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53% over ForgeRock’s closing share price on October
10, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the transaction announcement, and (2) a premium of approximately 44%
over the volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock for the 30-day period ending October 10,
2022.
Q:
What will happen to ForgeRock RSUs and ForgeRock options?
A:
Generally speaking, ForgeRock RSUs and ForgeRock options will be treated as follows:
•
At the effective time of the merger each vested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal in value to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common
stock or Class B common stock subject to such vested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective
time or the merger, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
15TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1)
the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such
unvested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the per
share price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each
Converted Cash Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions
(including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the
corresponding unvested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that
terms rendered inoperable by the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents entered into
connection with the merger will no longer have any force or effect.
•
At the effective time of the merger, each vested ForgeRock option will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or
Class B common stock subject to the vested ForgeRock option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the
per share price over the per share exercise price of such vested ForgeRock option, less applicable
withholding taxes.
•
At the effective time of the merger each unvested ForgeRock option will be converted into the contingent
right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total
number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested
ForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any,
of the per share price over the per share exercise price per of such unvested ForgeRock option, less
applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such Converted
Cash Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including
acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the
corresponding unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Any underwater ForgeRock option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration
or payment.
Q:
What will happen to the ESPP?
A:
From the date of the merger agreement, we will take all actions necessary to (1) provide that no new individuals
will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP; (2) make any adjustment that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the
shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase
period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the
ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP
during the offering period or purchase period that is in effect on date of the merger agreement; (4) cause the
exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP (but otherwise no other of our Class A common stock under
the ESPP will be issued); (5) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant
to the ESPP, and if the effective time of the merger would otherwise occur before the end of the Current Purchase
Period, shorten the Current Purchase Period as of a specified trading day at least ten days prior to the date on
which the effective time of the merger occurs; and (6) not extend the Current Purchase Period. Immediately prior
to and effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will
terminate the ESPP and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock and
ForgeRock will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the
time of the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will take place on January 12, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time. You may attend the special
meeting via a live interactive webcast on the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/FORG2023SM. You
will be able to listen to the special meeting live and vote online. You will need the control number found on your
proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your
shares).
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of our stockholders as of the close of business on November 18, 2022, which is the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to vote their shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the
special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 48,219,841 shares of our Class A
common stock and 37,572,279 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Each share of our Class A common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one
vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting and each share of our Class B
common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to ten votes per share on each matter properly
brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of ForgeRock as of the record date (voting together as a single class) is required to adopt the
merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) attend and vote at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger;
and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of our common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of our common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time
of the special meeting, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares will not have any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a
quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these
proposals.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we
refer to or incorporate by reference in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), so that your
shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee for information on how to vote your shares.
Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you attend the special meeting and vote at
the special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
Q:
How does the ForgeRock Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time,
to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with
the merger. Instead: (1) ForgeRock will remain an independent public company; (2) our Class A common stock
will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, ForgeRock has agreed to pay Parent (or
its designee) a termination fee.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination
Fees and Remedies.”
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of
ForgeRock’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in
nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the
consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to our named executive officers in connection with or
following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related
Executive Compensation.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock
to our named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
ForgeRock is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may
become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the
compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What will happen if ForgeRock’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become
payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote and will
not be binding on ForgeRock or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such
compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the
compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger will or may be paid to ForgeRock’s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not approve
such compensation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a
stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf
of ForgeRock. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the
special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of our common stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock
held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee
who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you
have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their
instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no
effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment
proposal.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your
convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
•
by calling the toll-free (within the United States or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the
enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of our common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when
voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if
you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common
stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you
beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of our common stock at the special meeting even if you have
previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically
over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or
nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special
meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote
your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
May I attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting?
A:
Yes. You may attend the special meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/FORG2023SM. You will be able to listen to the special meeting live and vote
online. The special meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, on January 12, 2023. Online check-in will begin a
few minutes prior to the special meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting
instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares). As the special
meeting is virtual, there will be no physical meeting location.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special
meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is
provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the
instructions found on the proxy card). If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your
vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be
counted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against the
adoption of the merger agreement.
Q:
Why did ForgeRock choose to hold a virtual special meeting?
A:
The ForgeRock Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually in order to facilitate stockholder attendance
and participation by enabling stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from virtually any location around
the world, at no cost. However, you will bear any costs associated with your internet access, such as usage
charges from internet access providers and telephone companies. We believe this is the right choice for a
company with a global footprint. A virtual special meeting makes it possible for more stockholders (regardless of
size, resources or physical location) to have direct access to information, while saving us and our stockholders
time and money. We also believe that the online tools that we have selected will increase stockholder
communication. We remain very sensitive to concerns that virtual meetings may diminish stockholder voice or
reduce accountability. Accordingly, we have designed our virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,
stockholder access, participation and communication.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common
stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is
called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is
called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by telephone or by
the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Francis Rosch, John
Fernandez and Samuel Fleischmann, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy
holders for the special meeting.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed
proxy card.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if you
obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the
special meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the ForgeRock
Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time,
to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal
containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the
appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless
you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the
cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you
hold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the
payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration upon receipt of a customary
“agent’s message” and any other items specified by the payment agent.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective
date of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the
special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies ForgeRock in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger
is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those
shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record
date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided
for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the
instructions found on the proxy card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy
card and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than
one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, ForgeRock may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting.
ForgeRock intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC
following the special meeting. All reports that ForgeRock files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For
more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the
merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our
common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our
common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States,
but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification
procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine
the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances
and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.
taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice
to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is
provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of
the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to
the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and no agreement with any governmental
authority not to consummate the merger shall be in effect. In addition, the merger cannot be completed until all
consents, approvals and filings required under certain specified FDI laws have been obtained or made and all
waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable
governmental authorities) relating to the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger shall have expired or otherwise been terminated under any such laws.
ForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with
the FTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC
and the DOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12
of the HSR Act in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent’s notification and
report form was withdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form
on November 28, 2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting period commenced under the HSR Act. Both before
and after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge
the merger on antitrust grounds.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock, submitted the specified FDI filings on
October 31, 2022.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital stock) who (1)
do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares of our
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet
certain other conditions and statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not
withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their
shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section
262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these persons will be entitled to have their shares appraised by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares, exclusive of
any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the
amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the
merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person
seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to
the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
additional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights, available at the following URL, accessible without subscription or cost, which is
incorporated herein by reference: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Q:
Do any of ForgeRock’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of
ForgeRock stockholders generally? 
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the ForgeRock Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the

statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Exchange Act and the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such
sections and other applicable laws. Such forward-looking statements include statements relating to ForgeRock’s
strategy, goals, future focus areas and the value of the proposed transaction to ForgeRock’s stockholders. These
forward-looking statements are based on ForgeRock’s management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information
currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and
may be identified by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,”
“target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or similar
expressions and the negatives of those terms. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties,
including statements regarding: the merger, including the expected timing of the closing of the merger; considerations
taken into account by the ForgeRock Board in approving the merger; and expectations for ForgeRock following the
closing of the merger.
If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of ForgeRock’s assumptions prove incorrect, ForgeRock’s
actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Additional risks and uncertainties include those associated with:
•
the possibility that the conditions to the closing of the merger are not satisfied, including the risk that
required approvals from our stockholders for the merger or required regulatory approvals to consummate
the merger are not obtained, on a timely basis or at all;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right to terminate the
merger, including in circumstances requiring ForgeRock to pay a termination fee;
•
uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the merger and the ability of each party to
consummate the merger;
•
the nature, cost and outcome of any legal proceeding that may be instituted against us and others relating
to the merger;
•
economic, market, business or geopolitical conditions (including resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, or the military conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions
against Russia and Belarus) or competition, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting

operating results and business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of
ForgeRock management or employees during the pendency of the merger;

•
the risk that our stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the merger and may decline significantly
if the merger is not completed on the terms reflected in the merger agreement, or at all;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, ForgeRock is restrained from soliciting other
acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential
long-term value of the successful execution of ForgeRock’s current strategy as an independent company;
•
possible disruption related to the merger to ForgeRock’s current plans and operations, including through
the loss of customers and employees; and
•
other risks and uncertainties detailed in the periodic reports that ForgeRock files with the SEC, including

Only our stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection
by stockholders for any purpose germane to the special meeting at our corporate offices located at 201 Mission
Street, Suite 2900, San Francisco, California 94105, during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten days
ending on the day before the date of the special meeting. The stockholder list will also be available to stockholders of

As of the record date, there were 48,219,841 shares of our Class A common stock and 37,572,279 shares of our Class B

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date. Adoption of the
merger agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.
26TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on
the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1)
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later
date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not
vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks
discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there
are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there are broker non-
votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will
have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.

case in their capacities as stockholders of ForgeRock, beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,

approximately 83.2% of the voting power of all the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the

Certain of ForgeRock’s directors and certain of their affiliates hold shares of common stock. As of the date of this
proxy statement, ForgeRock has not been informed that any of our directors or such affiliates intend to vote all of
their shares of our common stock other than: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in connection with the

All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies granted electronically over the internet or by
telephone) will, if received before the special meeting, be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the
instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies granted electronically over the internet
or by telephone) that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” adoption of the merger agreement;

other nominee by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee. If you do not (1) return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting instruction form; (2) vote over the
internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee; or (3) attend the special meeting and vote at the
special meeting with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you

proposals (A) to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (B) to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at

submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed

contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at
the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote

additional proxies, will allow our stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior
to their use at the special meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

The ForgeRock Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger-Recommendation of the ForgeRock Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously: (1)
determined that the merger agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and
approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in all
respects.
The ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2)
“FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in

In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement and (2) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger, our stockholders are also being asked to approve any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date
or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement. If a
quorum is not present, the chairperson of the special meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, without notice
other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The chairperson may also adjourn
the meeting to another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present. In addition, the special meeting could
be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned
or postponed, our stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time
before they are voted at the special meeting.",39,39

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by ForgeRock. We have retained Mackenzie Partners, Inc., a
professional proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and provide related advice and
informational support during the solicitation process, for a fee of up to $15,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. We will indemnify this firm against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In
addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares of our
common stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be
solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet. No
additional compensation will be paid for such services.

We currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of the
merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger
agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital stock) who (1) do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares through the effective
time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory
requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights
to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that such persons will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the
“fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair
value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except
that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash
payment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery;
and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to
make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to
the exercise of appraisal rights.
29TABLE OF CONTENTS
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record or a beneficial owner must (1) submit a written demand for
appraisal to ForgeRock before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in
person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold of record or own
beneficially the subject shares of our common stock through the effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply
with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of ForgeRock unless certain conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking
appraisal. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further
detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. You may find an electronic copy of Section 262 of the DGCL available

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock; (2) the separate corporate existence
32TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) ForgeRock will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the merger, ForgeRock will cease to be a publicly traded company, our Class A common stock will be
delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act and ForgeRock will no longer file periodic reports
with the SEC. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.
The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that
certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may
agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
Effect on ForgeRock if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger.
Instead, (1) ForgeRock will remain an independent public company; (2) our Class A common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (A) our management will continue to operate
the business as it is currently being operated; and (B) our stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks
and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in
which ForgeRock operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be
completed, the price of our Class A common stock may decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of your
shares of our common stock. If the merger is not completed, the ForgeRock Board will continue to evaluate and
review, among other things, ForgeRock’s business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make
whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is
not completed for any other reason, ForgeRock’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely
impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, ForgeRock has agreed to pay Parent (or its
designee) the applicable termination fee.

each outstanding share of our common stock that is (1) held by ForgeRock as treasury stock; (2) owned by
Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger

our stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or the merger
nor consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly demanded appraisal of such shares of our common stock

At or prior to the Closing, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the
aggregate per share price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates
(or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares,

The ForgeRock Board, together with senior management, regularly evaluates ForgeRock’s strategic direction and
ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening ForgeRock’s business and enhancing stockholder value.
As part of this evaluation, the ForgeRock Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives.
These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, ForgeRock’s current
business plan, with ForgeRock remaining an independent entity; (2) potential expansion opportunities through
acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships; (3) various capital raising alternatives; and (4) other
financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of ForgeRock.
In June 2021, after ForgeRock confidentially submitted a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with its
initial public offering and before ForgeRock became a publicly listed company, at the direction of the ForgeRock
Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan and ForgeRock’s other lead book-running manager in the initial public offering
contacted seven potential strategic acquirors, including Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic D, and two
financial sponsors, including Thoma Bravo, regarding a potential acquisition of ForgeRock. Of the contacted parties,
Thoma Bravo expressed interest in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock. ForgeRock entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo containing a customary “standstill” restriction that would terminate
upon entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock. Thereafter, representatives of Thoma Bravo
conducted due diligence with respect to ForgeRock’s business. Thoma Bravo submitted two proposals to acquire
ForgeRock before ForgeRock’s initial public offering. At that time, the ForgeRock Board determined that ForgeRock
could achieve a more attractive valuation for our stockholders in an initial public offering. ForgeRock terminated
those discussions with Thoma Bravo regarding a potential acquisition in August 2021.
Following its initial public offering, ForgeRock from time to time received inbound inquiries expressing a non-specific
interest in pursuing a potential transaction from a potential strategic acquiror (which is referred to as “Strategic E”)
and three financial sponsors (which are referred to as “Sponsor A,” “Sponsor B” and “Sponsor C”). Fran Rosch,
ForgeRock’s chief executive officer, met with these parties from time to time to discuss ForgeRock’s business and the
industry in which it operates; other than as described below, these discussions did not advance beyond preliminary,
hypothetical conversations regarding a potential transaction or result in the receipt by ForgeRock of an acquisition
proposal. Mr. Rosch regularly updated Bruce Golden, as chairperson of the ForgeRock Board, on inquiries and
preliminary discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions involving ForgeRock.
On January 31, 2022, at Thoma Bravo’s request, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo to
generally discuss updates on ForgeRock’s business. At the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential
acquisition of ForgeRock.
On April 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Mr. Rosch’s invitation, to generally
discuss the potential benefits of a technology partnership between ForgeRock and another company. Entities
affiliated with Thoma Bravo had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire that other company on April 10, 2022.
At the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.
On May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior executive of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo’s request. During this
meeting, Thoma Bravo expressed a non-specific interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock but did not make a formal
acquisition proposal. Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that ForgeRock would be open to discussing a potential
acquisition. Thereafter, on or about May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on the meeting with Thoma Bravo.
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo’s request. Thoma
Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that it would be submitting an offer to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.00 per
share.
Later on May 25, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent to ForgeRock a non-binding indication of interest
addressed to the ForgeRock Board to acquire all of ForgeRock’s outstanding shares of common stock for $23.00 per
share (which is referred to as the “May proposal”), representing a 32% premium to ForgeRock’s closing share price as
of May 25, 2022. The May proposal also contemplated a “go-shop” provision that would permit ForgeRock to solicit
alternative bids for 30 days after signing a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma
Bravo. On May 26, 2022 Mr. Rosch informed Mr. Golden of ForgeRock’s receipt of the May proposal.
On May 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch informed the ForgeRock Board that Thoma Bravo had submitted the May proposal.
On June 1, 2022, the ForgeRock Board held a meeting, with members of ForgeRock’s management, representatives of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. (which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini”), ForgeRock’s outside legal advisor,
and, at the invitation of the ForgeRock Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan in attendance. As part of an ordinary
course market update, the representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the ForgeRock Board the current market
environment and ForgeRock’s trading and financial performance since its initial public offering. The representatives
of J.P. Morgan then left the meeting. Mr. Rosch reviewed the May proposal with the ForgeRock Board. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. It was proposed to establish a
strategic committee of the ForgeRock Board to work with ForgeRock’s legal counsel and other advisors in connection
with ForgeRock’s review of the May proposal, including its review of ForgeRock’s standalone plan and the
evaluation of other potential strategic alternatives. In considering the establishment of a strategic committee, the
ForgeRock Board discussed (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in the evaluation of the
May proposal and other strategic alternatives; (2) the possibility that ForgeRock’s management may need feedback
and direction on relatively short notice in connection with a potential process of considering strategic alternatives;
and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of directors oversee a potential process of considering
strategic alternatives. Following the discussion, the ForgeRock Board determined that it would form a strategic
committee of the ForgeRock Board to evaluate the May proposal, including comparing the proposal to ForgeRock’s
standalone plan and potential strategic alternatives.
On June 5, 2022, the ForgeRock Board, acting by unanimous written consent, established the strategic committee of
the ForgeRock Board (which we refer to as the “Strategic Committee”). The ForgeRock Board delegated authority to
the Strategic Committee to, among other things, (1) oversee and assist ForgeRock’s management, advisors and
consultants with respect to the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including to explore, evaluate and
consider potential counterparties to a strategic transaction involving ForgeRock; (2) explore, evaluate, consider,
review and negotiate the terms and conditions of any transaction relating to any strategic alternative; and (3) if
appropriate, recommend to the ForgeRock Board what action, if any, should be taken by ForgeRock with respect to
any strategic alternative. The ForgeRock Board retained the power and authority to approve the entry into a
definitive agreement relating to any strategic alternative, including a sale of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board also
determined that it would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. The ForgeRock
Board appointed Mr. Golden, Jeff Parks and Dave Welsh, all of whom are independent members of the ForgeRock
Board, as the members of the Strategic Committee.
On June 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of ForgeRock’s management and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee their
fiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to engage a financial advisor in connection with the
ForgeRock Board’s and Strategic Committee’s review of the May proposal. The Strategic Committee requested that
Mr. Golden, with the assistance of ForgeRock management, meet with J.P. Morgan and report back to the Strategic
Committee.
On June 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee informed the ForgeRock Board of its selection of J.P. Morgan as
ForgeRock’s financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of the May proposal. J.P. Morgan is well known to
ForgeRock given J.P. Morgan’s service as a lead book running manager in ForgeRock’s initial public offering. The
Strategic Committee selected J.P. Morgan to act as financial advisor to ForgeRock after considering J.P. Morgan’s
qualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of ForgeRock’s business and the industry in
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which ForgeRock operates and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic
transactions. In addition, representatives from J.P. Morgan had from time-to-time presented to the ForgeRock Board
and management about public market perspectives of ForgeRock.
On June 9, 2022, ForgeRock management distributed to the ForgeRock Board a draft of ForgeRock’s then-current
business plan, which had been prepared as a basis for issuing ForgeRock’s guidance for the second quarter of 2022
and subsequently updated by management, including the unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years
2022 through 2024 (which we refer to as the “June 2022 business plan”). Additional information about the
preparation and substance of the June 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” Following the ForgeRock Board’s review, management
provided the June 2022 business plan to representatives of J.P. Morgan for purposes of its preliminary financial
analysis of the May proposal.
On June 18, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The
representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic Committee discussed the May proposal and the
potential landscape of other potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most likely to be interested in
pursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock. Mr. Rosch noted that Strategic E had previously expressed a non-
specific interest in acquiring ForgeRock, and had indicated in a prior discussion that it may submit a proposal in July
2022. Strategic E never submitted such a proposal. The Strategic Committee authorized Mr. Rosch, on behalf of the
ForgeRock Board, to inform Thoma Bravo that the ForgeRock Board (1) was not interested in pursuing a transaction
with Thoma Bravo at $23.00 per share of ForgeRock at that time; and (2) would be interested in taking the next step in
pursuing a transaction if the offer price per share were increased to an amount “closer to $30.00 than $25.00.”
On June 19, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch contacted a senior representative of Thoma Bravo
and Mr. Rosch delivered the ForgeRock Board’s message. Thoma Bravo responded that it would need to conduct
additional due diligence before submitting a revised proposal. Mr. Rosch informed the Strategic Committee of Thoma
Bravo’s response, and the Strategic Committee authorized management to provide additional due diligence to Thoma
Bravo.
On June 29, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The
Strategic Committee reviewed J.P. Morgan’s relationship disclosure letter. Mr. Rosch also provided an update on
ForgeRock’s anticipated results for the second quarter of 2022, including relative to ForgeRock’s publicly issued
guidance for this period (which we refer to as the “Q2 2022 results”). It was noted that ForgeRock would not meet
its publicly issued guidance for annual recurring revenue for the second quarter of 2022.
On July 5, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The
Strategic Committee discussed the Q2 2022 results. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic
Committee instructed management to update the June 2022 business plan in light of the Q2 2022 results and to
present the updated business plan to the ForgeRock Board. Representatives of management left the meeting. The
Strategic Committee determined that it would instruct J.P. Morgan to contact Thoma Bravo to share the Q2 2022
results and gauge Thoma Bravo’s reaction to the Q2 2022 results.
On July 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan spoke to a senior representative of Thoma Bravo regarding the Q2
2022 results. Thoma Bravo informed J.P. Morgan that it remained interested in acquiring ForgeRock, and that Thoma
Bravo intended to submit a revised proposal following its next investment committee meeting in mid-July 2022.
On July 11, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of Thoma Bravo’s diligence over the preceding week, and
management’s plan to update its June 2022 business plan based on actual results and business trends, including the
Q2 2022 results. The Strategic Committee discussed a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic
transaction from additional potential counterparties, including the possibility of soliciting alternative acquisition
proposals in conjunction with Thoma Bravo’s anticipated acquisition proposal and the possibility of executing such
a strategic transaction prior to ForgeRock's upcoming public announcement of its earnings results for the second
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
quarter of 2022. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed various strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most
likely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, based on such acquirors’ perceived interest in
making investments in the industry in which ForgeRock operates, whether they had previously expressed a credible
interest in acquiring ForgeRock and/or their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size. The
Strategic Committee discussed the risks in connection with an outreach, and in particular, the risk that the Q2 2022
results could be leaked. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee
their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that an outreach process to additional
potential acquirors (1) was unlikely to yield a counterparty that could execute a transaction before ForgeRock’s
upcoming earnings announcement; (2) would consume management’s time as it was preparing for its upcoming
earnings announcement; and (3) posed a substantial risk of leaks. The Strategic Committee also considered that
should ForgeRock enter into a transaction with Thoma Bravo in conjunction with ForgeRock’s upcoming earnings
announcement, it expected that ForgeRock would have the ability to conduct a broad outreach process during a go-
shop period as previously proposed by Thoma Bravo. The Strategic Committee determined that it would wait until
Thoma Bravo submitted a revised offer, and at that time, the Strategic Committee would revisit whether to initiate an
outreach to certain counterparties.
On July 12, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due
diligence information.
On July 13, 2022, ForgeRock amended and restated the confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo that had been
entered into prior to ForgeRock’s initial public offering. As amended, the confidentiality agreement, among other
things, extended the term of the confidentiality restrictions and the “standstill” period under the existing
confidentiality agreement.
Later on July 13, 2022, members of management gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Thoma
Bravo.
On July 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.
Representatives of management discussed management’s then-updated business plan, including the unaudited
prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in the business plan as of July 2022
(which we refer to as the “July 2022 business plan”). Additional information about the preparation and substance of
the July 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information.” The ForgeRock Board authorized sharing the July 2022 business plan with Thoma Bravo. The
July 2022 business plan was provided to Thoma Bravo in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for purposes of its
ongoing financial analyses.
On July 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo orally informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that, following additional diligence,
Thoma Bravo maintained its initial proposed purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the “July
proposal”). Representatives of Thoma Bravo noted to the representatives of J.P. Morgan that they viewed the July
proposal as an improvement to the May proposal in light of the Q2 2022 results.
On July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan shared with the Strategic Committee the July proposal, and
reviewed with the Strategic Committee the current market and industry conditions and potential responses to the July
proposal, including (1) attempting to negotiate for a higher purchase price; (2) guiding Thoma Bravo to an increased
purchase price range; or (3) terminating the discussions with Thoma Bravo altogether. The representatives of J.P.
Morgan then left the meeting. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution
risks to achieving ForgeRock’s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and
challenges to attracting and retaining personnel.
Later on July 20, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and management reviewed the discussions with Thoma Bravo
to date, and the July proposal. The Strategic Committee reviewed with the ForgeRock Board potential responses to
the July proposal. The ForgeRock Board considered a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic
transaction from additional potential counterparties at that time, including the risks in connection with such an
outreach. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution risks to achieving
ForgeRock’s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and challenges to attracting
and retaining personnel.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Still later on July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee reconvened, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed ForgeRock’s potential responses to the July
proposal. The Strategic Committee discussed again whether to conduct a potential outreach process to solicit
interest from additional potential counterparties at that time. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with
the members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that
ForgeRock should continue to discuss a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, and the Strategic Committee
instructed J.P. Morgan to request that Thoma Bravo submit a revised acquisition proposal at an increased value. The
Strategic Committee also determined not to conduct a broader outreach process to additional potential acquirors at
that time. Representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated the Strategic Committee’s response to Thoma Bravo.
On July 26, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that Thoma Bravo had
determined that it would not move forward with an acquisition of ForgeRock at that time. Among the reasons cited
were the uncertainty surrounding the market’s reaction to ForgeRock’s upcoming second quarter earnings
announcement and ForgeRock’s then-current trading price.
On July 27, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed Thoma Bravo’s decision to not move forward with an acquisition
at that time. The Strategic Committee also discussed ForgeRock’s upcoming earnings announcement and guidance
for the remainder of 2022. The Strategic Committee determined that it would suspend its review of strategic
alternatives at that time.
On July 28, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch updated
the ForgeRock Board on the discussions with Thoma Bravo. The ForgeRock Board discussed Thoma Bravo’s
decision not to move forward with an acquisition at that time. The ForgeRock Board determined that it would
suspend its review of strategic alternatives at that time. As a result, on that day, ForgeRock sent to Thoma Bravo a
request to return or destroy ForgeRock confidential information in accordance with the confidentiality agreement
with Thoma Bravo.
On August 3, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Rosch to indicate interest in re-engaging in
discussions with ForgeRock regarding a potential transaction at some point in the future. Later on August 3, 2022,
Mr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on Thoma Bravo’s outreach.
On August 11, 2022, ForgeRock announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.
On August 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. In light of the potential for Thoma Bravo to renew its interest in exploring an acquisition of ForgeRock,
and based on the Strategic Committee’s prior review of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most
likely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, the Strategic Committee determined it would be
prudent to begin conversations with those additional parties that might consider an acquisition of ForgeRock. The
Strategic Committee directed management to work with J.P. Morgan to contact four financial sponsors, including
Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C, and four strategic acquirors, Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic
D, to solicit interest in a potential acquisition of ForgeRock, and if such counterparties decided to engage, enter into
confidentiality agreements, hold initial management presentations and provide due diligence to such parties.
Later on August 26, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. Mr. Golden, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, informed the ForgeRock Board of the Strategic
Committee’s determination to engage in a targeted outreach to certain potential counterparties. The ForgeRock Board
agreed with the Strategic Committee’s determination.
Between August 26, 2022 and August 28, 2022, representatives of the financial sponsors and potential strategic
acquirors that the Strategic Committee had selected for outreach were contacted (at the request of the Strategic
Committee) by representatives of J.P. Morgan and/or Mr. Rosch. Of the parties contacted, Sponsor A, Sponsor B and
Sponsor C expressed an interest in pursuing discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with ForgeRock.
The remaining parties declined.
On August 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022, ForgeRock entered into confidentiality agreements with each of Sponsor
A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. The confidentiality agreements with each of those parties included a customary
“standstill” restriction that would terminate upon ForgeRock’s entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of
ForgeRock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 2, 2022, representatives of management gave management presentations regarding ForgeRock to each
of Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Thereafter, and throughout the month of September, each of Sponsor A,
Sponsor B and Sponsor C engaged in due diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple
meetings with members of ForgeRock management, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P.
Morgan to discuss ForgeRock’s business and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.
On September 12, 2022, a representative of Sponsor D, on an unsolicited basis, contacted a ForgeRock director,
expressing a non-specific interest in meeting with representatives of management. Thereafter, the director connected
representatives of Sponsor D with Mr. Rosch, and Mr. Rosch had an introductory meeting with representatives of
Sponsor D on September 30, 2022.
On September 12, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo’s request. The
representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo desired to re-engage in discussions regarding
a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.
On September 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. The Strategic Committee updated the ForgeRock Board on the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo,
Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Representatives of management reviewed management’s then-updated
business plan, including the unaudited financial prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024
included in the business plan as of September 2022 (which we refer to as the “September 2022 business plan”).

authorized sharing the September 2022 business plan with interested potential acquirors. The September 2022
business plan was provided to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for
purposes of its ongoing financial analyses.
On September 15, 2022, representatives of Sponsor C informed Mr. Rosch that Sponsor C was not interested in
pursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock at that time.
On September 15, 2022, representatives of management met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to review the
September 2022 business plan and to discuss general updates to ForgeRock’s business since July 2022. Thereafter,
and until the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, Thoma Bravo and its representatives engaged in
due diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple meetings with members of ForgeRock
management, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss ForgeRock’s
business and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.
Later on September 15, 2022, Sponsor A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $23.15 per share (which we refer to as the “Sponsor A
proposal”).
On September 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an update on the due diligence information made available to, and
discussions with, the potentially interested acquirors, including Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Mr. Rosch
noted that management expected that Thoma Bravo may make an updated proposal the following week.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with the Strategic Committee a preliminary financial analysis of the
Sponsor A proposal. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertain status of Sponsor B, which had indicated it
remained interested in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock, but required additional due diligence before
it could make a proposal. With respect to the Sponsor A proposal, the Strategic Committee authorized the
representatives of management and J.P. Morgan to inform Sponsor A that its proposal was too low for the ForgeRock
Board to find compelling, and to inquire what additional due diligence Sponsor A required to raise its bid. On
September 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, communicated this information to
Sponsor A.
On September 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $21.75 per share (which we refer to as the “September
proposal”). The September proposal also replaced the “go-shop” provision previously proposed by Thoma Bravo
with a “no-shop” provision that would restrict ForgeRock from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals after
signing a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma Bravo.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 20, 2022, Sponsor A was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due
diligence information. On September 22, 2022, Sponsor B was granted access to the virtual data room. On September
25, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted renewed access to the virtual data room.
On September 21, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of discussions with Thoma Bravo and Sponsor A, including
that Sponsor A had indicated it was considering the submission of a revised proposal above $24.00 per share.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan and a member of the Strategic Committee reviewed similar discussions each had
separately had with senior representatives of Sponsor A. The Strategic Committee discussed the unsolicited
outreach from Sponsor D. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that Sponsor D was unlikely to
successfully pursue a full acquisition of ForgeRock on an acceptable timeline. The Strategic Committee discussed
potential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock’s September 2022 business plan, including current market and
industry conditions and challenges to attracting and retaining personnel. The Strategic Committee instructed
management and J.P. Morgan to (1) continue to encourage Sponsor A to submit a revised proposal; (2) continue to
provide Sponsor B with sufficient due diligence to enable it to make a proposal; and (3) inform Thoma Bravo that the
September proposal was too low for the ForgeRock Board to find acceptable, and, as necessary, facilitate additional
due diligence in order for Thoma Bravo to submit an increased proposal.
On September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma
Bravo. At the meeting, Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that the September proposal was too low for the ForgeRock
Board to accept.
On September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan met with representatives of Sponsor B. At this meeting,
Sponsor B indicated that it would need additional time to complete diligence and to decide whether it would pursue
an acquisition of ForgeRock.
On September 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A
and Sponsor B. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertainty of Sponsor B’s status. The representatives of J.P.
Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the September proposal and the Sponsor A proposal. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed certain potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a potential
transaction with each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B, and the key terms of a proposed merger agreement
that would be provided to such parties should the ForgeRock Board decide to proceed.
On September 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Sponsor A’s investment
committee.
On September 29, 2022 and September 30, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met
with a senior representative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, the representative of Sponsor A indicated that
Sponsor A was unable to support a proposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share. The
representative of Sponsor A also indicated to Mr. Rosch that Sponsor A expected that any further proposal by
Sponsor A would be closer to $21.00 per share.
On September 29, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo. The representatives of Thoma
Bravo indicated that Thoma Bravo was (1) ready to proceed with an acquisition of ForgeRock; (2) open to
negotiating the purchase price; and (3) willing to provide an equity financing commitment for the entire aggregate
purchase price of the acquisition (i.e., a full “equity backstop”). A senior representative of Thoma Bravo delivered the
same message to representatives of J.P. Morgan during a meeting on September 29, 2022.
On September 30, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A
and Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that based on the lack of urgency with which Sponsor B was moving, it was unlikely
that Sponsor B would make a proposal to acquire ForgeRock. The Strategic Committee also discussed the possibility
of entering into exclusive negotiations with a potential acquiror. The Strategic Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and
management to (1) instruct each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B to submit “final” proposals by October
3, 2022; (2) inform the parties that ForgeRock would be willing to enter into exclusivity for a limited period with
respect to acquisition proposals at a purchase price of $24.00 per share of our common stock; and (3) provide the
parties an overview of ForgeRock’s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022

to support ForgeRock seeking increased acquisition proposals. Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan
subsequently communicated the ForgeRock Board’s message regarding price and provided an overview of
ForgeRock’s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022 to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor
B.
On October 1, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo had completed financial
due diligence and was prepared to move expeditiously to sign and announce a transaction.
On October 1, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the
“first October proposal”). The first October proposal contemplated (1) a full “equity backstop” of the purchase price;
and (2) that ForgeRock enter into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.
Later on October 1, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee instructed management and representatives of J.P. Morgan to make a
counterproposal for Thoma Bravo to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.50 per share. Still later on October
1, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, conveyed this counterproposal to Thoma Bravo.
On October 1 and October 2, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met with a senior
representative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, Sponsor A indicated that Sponsor A was unable to make a
proposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share.
On October 2, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our
common stock for $23.25 per share. Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that this represented Thoma Bravo’s “best and
final” offer (which we refer to as the “final Thoma Bravo proposal”). The final Thoma Bravo proposal also
contemplated that ForgeRock enter exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.
Later on October 2, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee reviewed (1) the final Thoma Bravo proposal; and (2) the status of
negotiations with each of Sponsor A and Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that Sponsor B had been unresponsive to
requests to submit a proposal by October 3, 2022. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The
representatives of management reviewed potential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock’s September 2022
business plan. The representatives of management then left the meeting and the Strategic Committee continued to
discuss the final Thoma Bravo proposal in executive session. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with
the Strategic Committee members their fiduciary duties and potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a
transaction with Thoma Bravo. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to enter into exclusive negotiations
with Thoma Bravo based on the final Thoma Bravo proposal. In making its determination, the Strategic Committee
considered, among other things, (1) the fact that Sponsor A was not prepared to submit a revised proposal at or
above the original Sponsor A proposal; (2) the uncertainty around Sponsor B's status, and the low likelihood that
Sponsor B would submit any acquisition proposal, let alone a proposal that the ForgeRock Board would consider
attractive; (3) the outreach that ForgeRock had conducted to other potential acquirors; (4) ForgeRock’s prospects as
a stand-alone company; (5) certain potential benefits and risks to completing a transaction with Thoma Bravo; and (6)
the uncertainty in the debt financing markets, and Thoma Bravo’s commitment to provide a full “equity backstop” for
the purchase price. Representatives of management and J.P. Morgan rejoined the meeting. The Strategic Committee
directed management to work with Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan to negotiate the terms of the draft merger
agreement, with the objective of reaching a potential definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma
Bravo during the exclusivity period. The Strategic Committee reviewed the material terms of a proposed engagement
letter with J.P. Morgan to memorialize the terms of J.P. Morgan’s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock, and
approved ForgeRock’s entry into such engagement letter on the terms discussed.
Still later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on
October 6, 2022. Thereafter, ForgeRock provided a draft merger agreement to Thoma Bravo as prepared by Wilson
Sonsini. The draft merger agreement provided for a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent in the event the
merger agreement was terminated in certain circumstances at a time when the applicable regulatory approvals
required to complete the merger had not been obtained.
Still later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan with respect to J.P.
Morgan’s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following delivery of the draft merger agreement, representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (which
we refer to as “Kirkland & Ellis”), legal counsel to Thoma Bravo, met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger
agreement. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the respective efforts required by
ForgeRock and Parent to obtain the required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the merger; (2) the
inclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent and the terms on which it might be payable; (3) the
“termination date” of the merger agreement and the extensions thereto; (4) the restrictions on ForgeRock’s operation
of the business prior to the completion of the merger (i.e., the “interim operating covenants”), including with respect
to employee and compensation matters; and (5) the conditions to each party’s obligations to close the merger. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis also negotiated the terms of the limited guaranty and the
equity commitment letter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Kirkland & Ellis and certain of ForgeRock’s
directors and their affiliated investment funds, together with their representatives, also negotiated the terms of the
voting agreements.
Following delivery of the draft merger agreement, Messrs. Rosch and Fernandez met on numerous occasions with
senior representatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the interim operating covenants of the merger agreement.
On October 6, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. Messrs. Rosch and Golden reviewed the status of negotiations of the draft merger agreement with
Thoma Bravo, and the discussions with Sponsor A and Sponsor B prior to entering into exclusivity with Thoma
Bravo. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then joined the meeting and reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan’s
preliminary financial analysis of the final Thoma Bravo proposal based on the September 2022 business plan. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and then discussed the key terms
of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter. Mr. Rosch confirmed to the ForgeRock Board that neither
he nor, to his knowledge, any other member of management had engaged in any discussions with Thoma Bravo
concerning any “rollover” of any equity stake in ForgeRock in connection with a potential acquisition, or the
possibility of employment following an acquisition, or the potential terms thereof. The representatives of J.P. Morgan
and management left the meeting and the ForgeRock Board continued in executive session. The ForgeRock Board
unanimously approved continuing to pursue a transaction with Thoma Bravo and authorized management to grant
Thoma Bravo one-day exclusivity extensions through October 9, 2022. The ForgeRock Board instructed the
representatives of Wilson Sonsini to continue to negotiate for the inclusion in the merger agreement of a regulatory
termination fee payable by Parent.
On October 7, 2022, ForgeRock extended exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on October 7,
2022.
On October 8, 2022, Mr. Rosch, and Messrs. Golden and Welsh, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, met with senior
representatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the regulatory provisions in the merger agreement, including the
potential inclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent.
On October 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the open points in the merger agreement. The Strategic Committee
determined that ForgeRock would accept not including a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent, and seek to
finalize the other remaining provisions of the merger agreement.
On October 9, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. Mr. Golden summarized the status of negotiations with Thoma Bravo with respect to the regulatory
provisions, the interim operating covenants and other terms of the draft merger agreement, noting the Strategic
Committee’s recommendation that the ForgeRock Board proceed without a regulatory termination fee payable by
Parent in the merger agreement. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the ForgeRock
Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan’s financial
analysis of the consideration to be paid by Thoma Bravo in the merger, noting that J.P. Morgan was prepared to
render its opinion that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other factors that would be set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be
paid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view, to such holders. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the remaining key terms of the merger
agreement and the equity commitment letter. The ForgeRock Board authorized the representatives of management, J.P.
Morgan and Wilson Sonsini to finalize negotiation of the merger agreement with Thoma Bravo, under the supervision
of the Strategic Committee and consistent with the terms presented to the ForgeRock Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 10, 2022, the merger agreement, equity commitment letter, limited guaranty, voting agreements and other
transaction documents were finalized.
Later on October 10, 2022, the representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered, together with a copy of the financial analysis
reviewed and discussed by J.P. Morgan with the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022, J.P. Morgan’s written opinion
to the ForgeRock Board, dated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in
cash to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
On the evening of October 10, 2022, the members of the ForgeRock Board, by unanimous written consent: (1)
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of ForgeRock and our stockholders; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by
ForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation
of the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders
of ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby; and (4) directed that
the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting

Recommendation of the ForgeRock Board
On October 10, 2022, the ForgeRock Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and its stockholders;
(2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by ForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its
covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders of ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby; and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be
submitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting thereof.
The ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2)
“FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or
dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the ForgeRock Board consulted with ForgeRock management, as
well as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan. In recommending that ForgeRock stockholders
vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the ForgeRock Board considered and analyzed a number of
factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based
on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the ForgeRock Board
concluded that entering into the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and
our stockholders.
The ForgeRock Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and
recommendation:
•
Business, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The ForgeRock Board considered the
current and historical and financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive positioning
43TABLE OF CONTENTS
of ForgeRock, as well as ForgeRock’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In
particular, the ForgeRock Board considered management’s then current business plan, including the
September 2022 business plan. Additional information about the preparation and substance of the
September 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information.” The ForgeRock Board considered these plans and the potential
opportunities that they presented against, among other various execution and other risks to achieving
management’s business plan and related uncertainties, including (1) the likelihood that management’s
business plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short and long term,
including the ability to maintain management’s growth targets; (2) the impact of market, customer and
competitive trends on ForgeRock; and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to market
conditions that could reduce the price of our Class A common stock. Among the potential risks identified
by the ForgeRock Board were:
○
ForgeRock’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among
these risks were consideration of (1) ForgeRock’s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to
those of its competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats; (3) challenges to acquiring new
customers or retaining our existing customers; (4) challenges to attracting and retaining personnel;
and (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating costs and profitability of companies in
ForgeRock’s industry generally and other risk factors described in ForgeRock’s other filings with the
SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
○
The current market and industry conditions, including international, national and local economic
conditions, the current environment in the enterprise identity security industry, the likely effect of
these factors on ForgeRock and the execution of ForgeRock’s plans as a standalone public company,
and the possibility that market and industry conditions-for ForgeRock and the larger economy- will
not improve and could get worse.
○
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded
company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The ForgeRock Board was
aware that the price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted if ForgeRock failed to
meet investor expectations, including if ForgeRock failed to meet its growth objectives.
○
The historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of ForgeRock’s
Class A common stock.
•
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic review
process overseen by the Strategic Committee. The ForgeRock Board considered that, at ForgeRock’s
direction, representatives of J.P. Morgan, together with representatives of ForgeRock management and the
ForgeRock Board, affirmatively contacted four potential strategic acquirers and four financial sponsors (in
addition to Thoma Bravo) concerning their interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board
considered the nature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over several weeks and that,
of these potential acquirers, only Sponsor A made a proposal for an acquisition of ForgeRock, which was
ultimately lower than the per share merger consideration.
•
Cash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the
merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business
and financial execution risks of management’s business plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates
uncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of ForgeRock’s business.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the ForgeRock Board that the per share merger
consideration represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking
into account the ForgeRock Board’s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy,
assets, liabilities and general financial condition of ForgeRock on a historical and prospective basis. In
addition, the ForgeRock Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described
above, the per share merger consideration reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common
stock. The ForgeRock Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a
premium of approximately 53% over ForgeRock’s closing share price on October 10, 2022, the last full
trading day prior to the transaction announcement, and (2) a premium of approximately 44% over the
volume weighted average price of ForgeRock stock for the 30 days ending October 10, 2022.
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the ForgeRock Board that none of the possible
alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate ForgeRock as an independent
company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives,
as well as the potential benefits and risks to ForgeRock’s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing
and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us
to create greater value for our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business,
competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.
•
Fairness Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The written opinion of J.P. Morgan delivered to the ForgeRock Board,
dated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to
be paid to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B
to this proxy statement.
•
Negotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which
was the product of arms’-length negotiations, and the belief of the ForgeRock Board that the merger
agreement contained terms that provided ForgeRock with a high level of closing certainty. The factors
considered included:
○
ForgeRock’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations
with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
○
The ForgeRock Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third
parties from making a superior proposal.
○
The ForgeRock Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its
recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
○
ForgeRock’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the ForgeRock Board believed that the termination
fee payable by ForgeRock in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees
payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
○
The limited conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably
likely to be consummated.
○
ForgeRock’s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity
commitment letter, to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be
funded as contemplated by the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter.
○
The fact that Thoma Bravo agreed to provide a full equity backstop for the full purchase price.
•
Business Reputation of Thoma Bravo. The ForgeRock Board believed that the business reputation and
financial resources of Thoma Bravo were factors that supported the conclusion that a transaction with
Parent (which is owned by Thoma Bravo) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a
substantial likelihood of being consummated successfully.
•
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders
(including beneficial owners of shares of our common stock) who timely and properly exercise such
appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
The ForgeRock Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors,
including the following:
•
Regulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the merger or
may seek to impose terms and conditions on their approvals that are not acceptable to Parent. In this
regard, the ForgeRock Board considered the provisions of the merger agreement related to obtaining the
regulatory
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
approvals required to complete the merger, including that the merger agreement did not provide for a
regulatory termination fee payable by Parent in the event the merger agreement was terminated in certain
circumstances at a time when the applicable required regulatory approvals required to complete the merger
had not been obtained.
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash
transaction means that our stockholders will not participate in ForgeRock’s future earnings or growth and
will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the merger, whether as
an independent company or in combination with other Thoma Bravo portfolio companies or assets. The
ForgeRock Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available to ForgeRock as an
independent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more
successful and valuable company.
•
No-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the merger agreement on ForgeRock’s ability to solicit competing
proposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject to certain exceptions to allow the ForgeRock
Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only upon the payment of
a termination fee).
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be
consummated, and if it is not consummated, that: (1) ForgeRock’s directors, senior management and other
employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions
from their work on behalf of ForgeRock during the pendency of the merger; (2) ForgeRock will have
incurred significant transaction and other costs; (3) ForgeRock’s continuing business relationships with
customers, business partners and employees may be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of our Class A
common stock could be adversely affected; (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to
ForgeRock in the event of the termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or
both; and (6) the failure of the merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among our
customers, potential customers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse impact on our
operating results.
•
Parent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent’s liabilities for monetary damages payable for breaches
under the merger agreement, limited guaranty or equity commitment letter are limited to $140.0 million.
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on ForgeRock’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The
restrictions on our conduct of ForgeRock’s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may
delay or prevent us from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion of the merger that, absent
the merger agreement, ForgeRock might have pursued.
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the:
(1) effects on ForgeRock’s employees, customers, operating results and stock price; (2) impact on
ForgeRock’s ability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and technical personnel; and (3)
potential for litigation in connection with the merger.
•
Termination Fee Payable by ForgeRock. The requirement that ForgeRock pay Parent a termination fee of
$60.0 million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the
ForgeRock Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The ForgeRock Board
considered the potentially dampening effect that this termination fee could have on a third party’s interest

This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the
ForgeRock Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the ForgeRock Board
concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In
light of the variety of factors considered by the ForgeRock Board and the complexity of these factors, the

Pursuant to an engagement letter, ForgeRock retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed merger. ForgeRock decided to
engage J.P. Morgan due to, among other things, J.P. Morgan’s familiarity with ForgeRock due to J.P. Morgan’s role as
a lead book-running manager in ForgeRock’s initial public offering, as well as J.P. Morgan’s qualifications, extensive
expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which ForgeRock operates and experience in
advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic transactions.
At the meeting of the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan presented J.P. Morgan’s
financial analysis of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the merger to the ForgeRock
Board and informed the ForgeRock Board that J.P. Morgan was prepared to render its oral opinion to the ForgeRock
Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
other factors to be set forth in its written opinion, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be paid to the
holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. On October 10, 2022, J.P. Morgan delivered its written opinion to the ForgeRock Board, dated October 10,
2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
other factors set forth in its opinion, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be paid to the holders of our
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 10, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. ForgeRock’s stockholders are urged
to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the ForgeRock Board (in its
capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only
to the consideration to be paid in the merger and did not address any other aspect of the merger. The issuance of J.P.
Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of ForgeRock as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
proposed merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated October 10, 2022 of the merger agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning ForgeRock and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of ForgeRock with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of our Class A common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of ForgeRock
relating to its business; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
47TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of ForgeRock with respect to
certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current business operations of ForgeRock, the financial condition and
future prospects and operations of ForgeRock, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or
appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by ForgeRock or otherwise reviewed by or for
J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with ForgeRock, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake
any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal
of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub under any
applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts
provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future
results of operations and financial condition of ForgeRock to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan
expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated as
described in the merger agreement, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect
from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties
made by ForgeRock and Parent in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct
in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments
made by advisors to ForgeRock with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be
obtained without any adverse effect on ForgeRock or on the contemplated benefits of the merger.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the proposed merger, and J.P. Morgan has
expressed no opinion as to (1) the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the
holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of ForgeRock, (2) the allocation of the
aggregate merger consideration to be paid to all holders of our common stock between the holders of our Class A
common stock and our Class B common stock, or the relative fairness of the consideration to the holders of any
shares of our common stock or (3) the underlying decision by ForgeRock to engage in the merger. J.P. Morgan also
did not express any opinion as to the voting rights associated with the our Class B common stock or any governance
or other rights of the holders thereof (and did not take any such rights into account in their analysis). Furthermore,
J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers,
directors, or employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of such persons relative to the
consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of
any such compensation. 
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the ForgeRock Board on October 10, 2022 and contained in the presentation
delivered to the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022 in anticipation of, and in connection with, the rendering of such
opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with
rendering such opinion and contained in such presentation, and does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the
financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.
Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of ForgeRock with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to ForgeRock.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan (which we refer to as the “Selected Companies”) were:
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
KnowBe4, Inc.
•
Tenable Holdings, Inc.
•
Rapid7, Inc.
•
Okta, Inc.
•
Elastic N.V.
•
Varonis Systems, Inc.
•
CyberArk Software Ltd.
The Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses
that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of
ForgeRock and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be considered similar to ForgeRock or
such businesses based on the nature of their assets and operations; however, none of the companies selected is
identical or directly comparable to ForgeRock or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of ForgeRock or such businesses. J.P. Morgan’s analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they
would affect ForgeRock or such businesses.
Using information obtained from the Selected Companies’ public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of October
7, 2022, J.P. Morgan calculated for each Selected Company the ratio of such company’s firm value (calculated as the
market value of the company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt, less cash and cash equivalents)
to the equity research analyst estimate for such company’s projected revenue in 2023, calendarized based on a
December 31 fiscal year end (which we refer to as the “FV/2023E Revenue”).
Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its
experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 4.00x to 7.00x for FV / 2023E
Revenue.
J.P. Morgan applied this range to ForgeRock’s estimated revenue for the 2023 fiscal year based on the September 2022
business plan, together with extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025
through 2032 prepared by ForgeRock management (as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”) to derive a range of firm values for ForgeRock, which was
then adjusted to take into account ForgeRock’s net debt totaling $(307.0 million) in the aggregate as of June 30, 2022,
to derive a range of implied equity values for ForgeRock. The analysis indicated the following range of implied per
share equity value for our common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05:
 
Implied Per Share 
Equity Value 
(rounded to the 
nearest $0.05)
 
Low
High
FV/2023E Revenue
$14.50
$22.70
The range of implied per share equity value was compared to (1) the closing price per share of our Class A common
stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.
Selected Transaction Analysis
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan reviewed selected transactions (which we refer to as the “Selected
Transactions”) involving businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis and based on its experience and
professional judgment, were considered by J.P. Morgan to be similar to ForgeRock’s business. Specifically, J.P.
Morgan reviewed the Selected Transactions set forth in the below table.
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For each of the Selected Transactions, J.P. Morgan calculated the firm value implied by the consideration to be paid
for the target company in such transaction as a multiple of published equity research analyst estimates for the target
company’s projected revenue for the 12-month period following the announcement of the applicable transaction
(which we refer to as the “FV/NTM Revenue”). The following table sets forth each of the Selected Transactions

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its
experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 6.0x to 10.0x for FV/NTM
Revenue and applied it to ForgeRock’s projected revenue for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, to derive a range of
firm values for ForgeRock, which was then adjusted to take into account ForgeRock’s net debt totaling $(307.0
million) in the aggregate as of June 30, 2022, to derive a range of implied equity values for ForgeRock. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $18.15 to
$27.80, which was compared to (1) the closing price per share of our Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7,
2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity
value per share for our common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using
estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value
of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their “present value.” The “unlevered free cash
flows,” for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated
by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. “Present value” refers to the current
value of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the cost of
capital and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated
by the asset for periods beyond the projections period.
J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the future standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows for fiscal year
2023 through fiscal year 2032 (which we refer to as the “DCF Projection Period”) based upon the September 2022
business plan and the September 2022 extrapolations. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
ForgeRock by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates, as provided by management of ForgeRock, ranging from
4.0% to 5.0% of the unlevered free cash flows of ForgeRock during the final year of the DCF Projection Period. The
unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted from December 31 of each year to
present values as of December 31, 2022 using a mid-year convention and a range of discount rates from 10.00% to
12.00%. The discount rate range was selected by J.P. Morgan based on J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the weighted
average cost of capital for ForgeRock.
Based on the foregoing, these analyses indicated a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock,
rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $18.30 to $31.00. The range of implied equity values per share of our common stock
were compared to (1) the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the
merger consideration of $23.25 per share of common stock.
Other Information
52-Week Historical Trading Range.
For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the trading range for the
Class A common stock for the 52-week period ended October 7, 2022, which was $11.94 per share to $36.00 per share,
and compared that range to (1) the closing price per share of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022,
and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share of our common stock.
Analyst Price Targets. 
For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the publicly available equity
research analyst price target range for the Class A common stock as of October 7, 2022, and noted that such price
target range was $17.00 per share to $26.00 per share, and compared that price target range to (1) the closing price per
share of Class A common stock of $15.80 as of October 7, 2022, and (2) the merger consideration of $23.25 per share
of our common stock.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes
that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the
foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete
view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from
any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference
for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of
ForgeRock. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses
or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or
negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the
totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected
Companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to ForgeRock, and none of the Selected
Transactions reviewed was identical to the merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to those of ForgeRock. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,
size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to ForgeRock
and the transactions compared to the merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control

purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise ForgeRock with respect to the
merger and deliver an opinion to the ForgeRock Board with respect to the merger on the basis of, among other things,
such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with
ForgeRock and the industries in which it operates.
J.P. Morgan received a fee from ForgeRock of $3.0 million for delivery of its opinion. ForgeRock has agreed to pay J.P.
Morgan a transaction fee equal to 1.30% of the merger consideration upon the closing of the transaction, against
which the opinion fee will be credited. In addition, ForgeRock has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable,
documented and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including travel costs and the
reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out
of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with ForgeRock and certain portfolio companies
of Thoma Bravo for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services
during such period have included (1) acting as joint lead bookrunner on ForgeRock’s initial public offering in October
2021 and (2) providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio companies
of Thoma Bravo unrelated to the merger. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a
lender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of Thoma Bravo, for which it receives customary
compensation or other financial benefits. During the two year period preceding the delivery of its opinion ending on
October 10, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from ForgeRock were approximately $6.0 million and
from affiliates of Thoma Bravo were approximately $105.0 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P.
Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of ForgeRock, Parent and Thoma Bravo and its portfolio companies for
their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short
positions in such securities or other financial instruments.",57,62

Other than in connection with our regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a
matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, ForgeRock
management regularly prepares, and the ForgeRock Board regularly evaluates, prospective financial information as to
ForgeRock’s future performance as part of its budget planning and long-term business plan. ForgeRock management
regularly makes and reviews with the ForgeRock Board updates to its business plan, including to reflect actual
results and trends and changes in ForgeRock’s performance and the industry in which it operates.
During the period in which it was engaged in discussions with Thoma Bravo and certain other parties with respect to
a potential transaction, and as part of our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives
(including continuing as an independent company), ForgeRock management prepared and reviewed with the
Strategic Committee and the ForgeRock Board various unaudited forward-looking financial information for fiscal
years 2022 through 2024 as part of ForgeRock management’s business plan, including the unaudited prospective
financial information summarized below. The tables below summarizes the (1) unaudited prospective financial
information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in our business plan as reviewed with the ForgeRock Board in
June 2022, which financial information is referred to as the “June 2022 business plan,” (2) unaudited prospective
financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in our business plan as updated by ForgeRock
management as of, and reviewed with the ForgeRock Board in, July, 2022, which financial information is referred to as
the “July 2022 business plan” and (3) unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024
included in our business plan as updated by ForgeRock management as of, and reviewed with the ForgeRock Board
in, September, 2022, which financial information is referred to as the “September 2022 business plan,” together with
extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 through 2032 prepared by
ForgeRock management for use by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering
an opinion to the ForgeRock Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to
the holders of our common stock (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC”), which extrapolations are referred to as the “September 2 0 2 2
extrapolations.” For purposes of this proxy statement, we refer to the June 2022 business plan, the July 2022
business plan, the September 2022 business plan and the September 2022 extrapolations, collectively, as the
“unaudited prospective financial information.” The unaudited prospective financial information was
52TABLE OF CONTENTS
prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided by ForgeRock management to the
Strategic Committee and the ForgeRock Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger
and strategic alternatives thereto. At the direction of the ForgeRock Board, the September 2022 business plan and the
September 2022 extrapolations were also provided to, and approved for use by, J.P. Morgan for purposes of
performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the ForgeRock Board as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock (as more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC”). In addition,
certain of the unaudited prospective financial information was provided to Thoma Bravo prior to the execution of the
merger agreement, and to certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving
ForgeRock, as part of discussions and to assist in their respective due diligence review during ForgeRock’s outreach
process to solicit interest regarding a potential strategic transaction. For more information on the preparation and use
of the unaudited prospective financial information, please see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-
Background of the Merger” and “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.”
The unaudited prospective financial information was developed by ForgeRock management as then-current estimates
of our future financial performance as an independent company, without giving effect to the merger, including any
impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger agreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will
be incurred in connection with completing the merger, or any changes to ForgeRock’s operations or strategy that may
be implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The unaudited
prospective financial information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed; it
should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The unaudited prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking statements. The unaudited prospective
financial information is not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether to vote for the
merger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special meeting, but rather is included in this proxy statement
to give stockholders access to certain non-public information that was provided to the Strategic Committee, the
ForgeRock Board and ForgeRock’s financial advisor for the purposes described above, as well as to Thoma Bravo
and certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving ForgeRock. By including the
unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement, none of ForgeRock, J.P. Morgan or any person
has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the
information contained in the unaudited prospective financial information. The inclusion of the unaudited prospective
financial information should not be regarded as an indication that the ForgeRock Board, the Strategic Committee,
ForgeRock, ForgeRock’s management or J.P. Morgan or any other person considered, or now considers, them to be
necessarily predictive of actual future results, and they should not be relied on as such. Further, the inclusion of the
unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or
representation by ForgeRock that the information presented is material. There can be no assurance that the
prospective results will be realized or that actual results of ForgeRock will not be materially lower or higher than
estimated. The unaudited prospective financial information has not been updated or revised to reflect information or
results either as of or after the date of this proxy statement. ForgeRock may report results of operations for periods
included in the unaudited prospective financial information that were or will be completed following the preparation
of the unaudited prospective financial information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to ForgeRock’s
periodic filings with the SEC for information on ForgeRock’s actual historical results.
The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the unaudited
prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the
SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or
presentation of prospective financial information. The unaudited prospective financial information included in this
proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, ForgeRock’s management. ForgeRock’s
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled
nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information and,
accordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young
LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates solely to ForgeRock’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.
Although the unaudited prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by ForgeRock management that ForgeRock management
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
believed in good faith were reasonable at the time the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared,
including with respect to growth rates; market share; market size and conditions; products and product mix; contract
duration expansion; renewal rates; annualized recurring revenue; operating expenses; margins; and net working
capital. ForgeRock’s ability to achieve the financial results contemplated by the unaudited prospective financial
information will be affected by our ability to achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable
periods, and will be subject to operational and execution risks associated therewith. The unaudited prospective
financial information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important
factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved
include, among others, (1) general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital, credit,
securities and foreign exchange markets; (2) our ability to continue and effectively manage our growth; (3) our ability
to continue to innovate in response to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing
customer needs, requirements or preferences; (4) compliance with laws and regulations relevant to ForgeRock’s
business, many of which are evolving; (5) competitive pressures in the identity security industry, especially from
larger, well-established companies; (6) our ability to efficiently acquire new customers, retain our existing customers
or expand the level of adoption of our platform with our existing customers; (7) our ability to attract, integrate and
retain qualified personnel; and (8) our relationships with our partners, including the software or services from third
parties used in our business. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be found in the various risk
factors included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are
outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the unaudited prospective financial information
will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the unaudited
prospective financial information. For information on factors that may cause our future results to materially vary, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.” The unaudited prospective financial
information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts. You should evaluate the unaudited
prospective financial information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements and other
information regarding ForgeRock contained in our public filings with the SEC. The unaudited prospective financial
information may not be consistent with ForgeRock’s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions detailed
above. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise
revise the unaudited prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such
information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.
Because the unaudited prospective financial information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to
sensitivities and assumptions, as well as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business
developments. The unaudited prospective financial information also covers multiple years, and such information by
its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The unaudited prospective financial information is not,
and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the unaudited prospective
financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results or
for purposes of making any investment decision.
Certain of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial information are non-GAAP financial
measures (which we refer to as the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These are financial performance measures that
are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a
substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used
by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they
exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Please refer to our other filings with the SEC for additional information on how we calculate
non-GAAP financial measures, including ARR (annualized recurring revenue). Financial measures included in
forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination
transaction, such as the unaudited prospective financial information, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP
financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the unaudited prospective financial
information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would
otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of
non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Strategic Committee, the ForgeRock Board,
J.P. Morgan, or any other person. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the unaudited
prospective financial information is provided in this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following table presents a summary of the June 2022 business plan. ForgeRock management made various
assumptions when preparing the June 2022 business plan, including (1) 34% year-over-year growth in ARR for fiscal
years 2023 and 2024; (2) for purposes of estimating revenues over the estimated periods, a continued shift in the
revenue mix from self-managed revenue to SaaS revenue; and (3) for purposes of estimating expenses over the
estimated periods, increasing cloud infrastructure and hosting costs, continued gradual improvement of professional
services margin, primarily driven by higher professional services utilization and higher professional services revenue
and revenue growth outpacing operating expense growth.

The following table presents a summary of the September 2022 business plan, together with the September 2022
extrapolations. The September 2022 business plan and the September 2022 extrapolations included estimated
Unlevered Free Cash Flow for fiscal years 2023 through 2032 prepared by ForgeRock management for use by J.P.
Morgan in connection with its opinion delivered to the ForgeRock Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of our common stock and related financial analyses (as described
in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC”). The
September 2022 business plan was updated by ForgeRock management to reflect ForgeRock’s results through the
third quarter of 2022 and business trends as of the time it was prepared. ForgeRock management made various
assumptions when preparing the unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024
included in the September 2022 business plan, including 32% year-over-year growth in ARR for fiscal years 2023 and
2024 and other revenue and expense assumptions generally consistent with the July 2022 business plan. The
extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2025 through 2032 included in the
September 2022 extrapolations were prepared using various assumptions, including (1) deceleration in year-over-year
growth in Total Revenue from 29% to 15% from fiscal years 2025 through 2032; (2) gross margins in fiscal years 2025
through 2032 consistent with estimates for fiscal years 2023 and 2024; and (3) over the extrapolated period, revenue
growth outpacing operating expense growth.

over period difference.
(10) Other, which includes the cash impact of foreign exchange adjustments to working capital, is estimated at less than one percent
of revenue in each year.
(11) Unlevered Free Cash Flow (less stock-based compensation expenses) is calculated as GAAP operating income, subtracting the
impact of cash taxes (including the impact of cash tax savings from NOLs) and capital expenditures, adding the impact of
depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangibles) and adding or subtracting, as applicable, changes in net
working capital. The unaudited prospective financial information as of September 2022 did not include estimates of Unlevered
Free Cash Flow for fiscal year 2022.

When considering the recommendation of the ForgeRock Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of
the merger agreement, our directors and certain of their affiliated funds, in each case in their capacities as
stockholders of ForgeRock, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and ForgeRock. The voting agreements
obligate these persons (including, in some instances, affiliated venture funds) to vote their respective shares of our
common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any competing transaction. In (1)
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3)
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the ForgeRock Board was aware of and
considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests are more
fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of ForgeRock will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Indemnification and
Insurance.”
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
Treatment of Equity Awards
Treatment of ForgeRock Restricted Stock Units
As of October 6, 2022, there were outstanding awards of ForgeRock RSUs (or portions thereof) that cover an
aggregate of 4,237,523 shares of our common stock, of which ForgeRock RSUs covering an aggregate of 86,841
shares of our common stock were held by our current non-employee directors and of which ForgeRock RSUs
covering an aggregate of 762,090 shares of our common stock were held by our current executive officers.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal in value to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B
common stock subject to such vested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time or the merger, multiplied
by (2) the per share price, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total
number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested ForgeRock RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the per share price, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each Converted Cash Award will
continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions
upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding unvested ForgeRock RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that terms rendered inoperable by the transactions
contemplated by the transaction documents entered into connection with the merger will no longer have any force or
effect.
Treatment of ForgeRock Options
As of October 6, 2022, there were outstanding ForgeRock options to purchase an aggregate of 11,661,319 shares of
our common stock with an exercise price below the per share price, of which ForgeRock options to purchase an
aggregate of 292,957 shares of our common stock were held by our current non-employee directors and of which
ForgeRock options to purchase an aggregate of 6,104,778 shares of our common stock were held by our current
executive officers.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested ForgeRock option will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common
stock subject to the vested ForgeRock option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the per
share exercise price of such vested ForgeRock option, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger each unvested ForgeRock option will be converted into the contingent right to
receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total number of shares of
our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the per share exercise
price per of such unvested ForgeRock option, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. Except as
otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such Converted Cash Award will continue to have, and will be
subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of
employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.
Any underwater ForgeRock option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or
payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
From the date of the merger agreement, we have taken and will take all actions necessary to (1) provide that no new
individuals will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP; (2) make any adjustment that may be necessary or advisable to
reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or
purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the
ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during the
offering period or purchase period that is in effect on date of the merger agreement; (4) cause the exercise (as of no
later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
right pursuant to the ESPP (but otherwise no other of our Class A common stock under the ESPP will be issued); (5)
provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP, and if the effective
time of the merger would otherwise occur before the end of the Current Purchase Period, shorten the Current
Purchase Period as of a specified trading day at least ten days prior to the date on which the effective time of the
merger occurs; and (6) not extend the Current Purchase Period. Immediately prior to and effective as of the effective
time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will terminate the ESPP and no further rights
will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination. Of our executive officers, three currently
participate in the ESPP. Our non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.
Equity Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers
The following table sets forth for each person who has been a ForgeRock executive officer or member of the
ForgeRock Board at any time since the beginning of ForgeRock’s 2021 fiscal year, (1) the number of shares of our
Class A common and Class B common stock directly held; (2) the number of shares of our common stock subject to
his or her in-the-money ForgeRock options; and (3) the number of shares of our common stock subject to his or her
ForgeRock RSUs, assuming the following and such additional assumptions set forth in the footnotes to the table:
•
the ForgeRock options and ForgeRock RSUs include those that would be outstanding as of October 31,
2022 (which, solely for purposes of this proxy statement, is the assumed closing date of the merger), in
accordance with their regular vesting schedules and assuming continued service by the individual through
such date; and
•
that the values of these shares of our common stock and equity awards are equal to the per share price of
$23.25 (minus any applicable exercise price in the case of the in-the-money ForgeRock options).

Represents shares of our Class A or Class B common stock directly held by the individual as of October 6, 2022, plus any shares
of our Class A or Class B common stock subject to ForgeRock’s RSUs that are scheduled to vest and be settled before October 31,
2022 (without regard to any change in control-related accelerated vesting). The amounts shown are determined assuming that no
individual disposed of shares of our common stock from October 6, 2022, through October 31, 2022, and that the ForgeRock
RSUs scheduled to vest and be settled prior to October 31, 2022, were settled. The number of shares shown does not include
shares of our common stock that the executive officer may purchase after the date of the merger agreement under the ESPP. For
additional information regarding the treatment of our ESPP in the merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.” For additional

of shares of our Class A or Class B common stock subject to ForgeRock RSUs. As described further in the sections of this proxy
statement captioned “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity-Based
Awards-2012 Equity Incentive Plan” and “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment
of Equity-Based Awards-Non-Employee Director Equity Awards” ForgeRock’s RSUs outstanding as of the date of the closing of
the merger (which date, solely for purposes of this proxy statement, is assumed to be October 31, 2022) that are held by
ForgeRock’s non-employee directors will accelerate vesting in full. In addition, each of the ForgeRock executive officers is
eligible for vesting acceleration of his or her ForgeRock RSUs in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment
under the Severance Policy. For additional information regarding the ForgeRock RSUs for our named executive officers, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation.”

Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships
Non-Employee Director Equity Awards
We have granted certain stock-based awards such as stock options and RSUs under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan
(which we refer to as the “2021 Plan”) and the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, that are outstanding and held
by our non-employee directors and executive officers, including pursuant to our Outside Director Compensation
Policy that are held by our non-employee directors. Pursuant to the 2021 Plan and the Outside Director Compensation
Policy, equity awards granted to our non-employee directors will accelerate vesting upon a “change in control.” The
closing of the merger will be a “change of control” within the meaning of our 2021 Plan and Outside Director
Compensation Policy. In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, any stock-based award granted after the
date of the merger agreement will have monthly vesting and not be entitled to acceleration.
Severance Policy
Effective July 1, 2021, our board of directors approved the following change of control and severance benefits for our
current executive officers and other key employees, pursuant to the Severance Policy.
Under the Severance Policy, if we terminate an executive officer’s employment other than for cause, death or
disability or the named executive officer resigns for good reason, as such terms are defined in the Severance Policy,
during the period from three months prior to until 12 months following a change of control, as defined in the
Severance Policy, with such period being referred to as the change of control period, such named executive officer
will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits, less applicable tax withholdings:
•
100% of the executive officer’s then-outstanding and unvested time-based equity awards will become
vested and exercisable;
•
a lump sum cash amount equal to 12 months (18 months for Mr. Rosch) of the executive officer’s base
salary;
•
a lump sum cash amount equal to 100% of the executive officer’s target annual bonus (150% for Mr.
Rosch); and
•
payment or reimbursement of continued health coverage for the named executive officer and the executive
officer’s dependents under COBRA for a period of up to 12 months (18 months for Mr. Rosch).
To receive the severance benefits upon a qualifying termination, whether or not in connection with a change of
control, a named executive officer must sign and not revoke our standard separation agreement and release of claims
within the timeframe set forth in the Severance Policy.
If any of the payments provided for under the Severance Policy or otherwise payable to a named executive officer
would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and would
be subject
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the related excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then the named executive officer will be
entitled to receive either full payment of benefits or such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the
benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the named
executive officer.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain
compensation for each of ForgeRock’s named executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules,
and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to ForgeRock’s named
executive officers. ForgeRock’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are
Francis Rosch, John Fernandez and Peter Barker. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments
quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards” and “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as may be
set forth in the footnotes to the table:
•
that the effective time of the merger will occur on October 31, 2022 (which is the assumed closing date of
the merger solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); and
•
that the named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of his or her employment at the
effective time of the merger that resulted in severance benefits becoming payable to such named executive
officer under the Severance Policy.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not actually occur
or be accurate on the date the merger actually closes. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named
executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. ForgeRock’s named
executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursements in connection
with the merger. As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value
of our common stock have been calculated based on the per share price.

The estimated amount for each named executive officer represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which the
named executive officer may become entitled under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the
change of control period, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of
ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.” The estimated amounts represent a lump sum
cash payment equal to the sum of (i) 12 months’ of each named executive officer’s base salary (or 18 months with respect to Mr.
Rosch); and (ii) 100% of the named executive officer’s target annual bonus for the year of termination (or 150% with respect to
Mr. Rosch). The above table sets forth the value of each of the base salary and target incentive opportunity severance benefits
payable to a named executive officer under the terms of the Severance Policy.

This amount includes the “double-trigger” vesting acceleration of 100% of the unvested portion of the named executive officer’s
outstanding ForgeRock RSUs and ForgeRock options to which the named executive officer may become entitled pursuant to the
treatment of such awards under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the change of control
period, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
With respect to unvested ForgeRock RSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of our common stock subject to the ForgeRock RSUs held by the named executive officer.
Accordingly, the amount
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
represents unvested ForgeRock RSUs covering a total of 321,088 shares of our common stock for Mr. Rosch; 147,323 shares of
our common stock for Mr. Fernandez; and 121,654 shares of our common stock for Mr. Barker.
With respect to each unvested ForgeRock option, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the sum of the per share price
less the applicable unvested ForgeRock option’s per share exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our
common stock subject to the unvested ForgeRock option held by the named executive officer, except that any underwater
ForgeRock option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or payment. Accordingly, the
amount represents unvested in-the-money ForgeRock options covering a total of 141,667 shares of our common stock for Mr.
Rosch; 487,709 shares of our common stock for Mr. Fernandez; and 35,417 shares of our common stock for Mr. Barker.
(3)
This amount represents a cash payment or reimbursement for 12 months of COBRA premiums (18 months with respect to Mr.
Rosch) that the named executive officer otherwise would be required to pay for continued post-employment, group health
coverage. These amounts are a “double-trigger” severance benefit that each of Messrs. Rosch, Fernandez and Barker may become
entitled to receive under the Severance Policy in connection with a qualifying termination during the change in control period, as
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Severance Policy.”
(4)
Under the Severance Policy, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would receive a greater
benefit on an after-tax basis by having some of his or her change in control-related payments and benefits being cut back rather
than paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on such amounts. This amount assumes no such
reduction is applied.
Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of ForgeRock’s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on
potential employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub; or (2)
entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving
corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub to be effective following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to
the effective time of the merger, Parent or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other
retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of
ForgeRock’s employees to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.

If the merger is consummated, our stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of our capital stock) who do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly demand an appraisal of their shares, who
continuously hold of record or beneficially own their shares through the effective time of the merger, who otherwise
comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose
their rights to appraisal may, subject to the conditions thereof, seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all

WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. 
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock or beneficial owners
who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of our common stock to ForgeRock prior
to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement; (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own such shares on the date of making the
demand for appraisal through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and
satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common
stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set
forth in the merger agreement, for the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount determined to be
the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to each person entitled to appraisal
prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described further below. However, after an appraisal
petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights,
will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the
closing of the merger, were listed on a national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (A) the total number of shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or
perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with
subsection (g) of Section 262; or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1
million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Given that the shares of our Class A common
stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the
merger), then the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of our Class A
common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is satisfied.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the
amount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and compound quarterly from the
effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before
the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person
entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount
so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash
payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record
date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or
information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be
accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes ForgeRock’s notice to our stockholders that
appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is available at the
following URL: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any
holder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such
holder’s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of
Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who
loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, ForgeRock believes that if a person is considering
exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common
stock must do ALL of the following:
•
such person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
•
such person must deliver to ForgeRock a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger
agreement at the special meeting;
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
such person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of our common stock from the
date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a person will lose appraisal rights if the
person transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and
•
such person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding
a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of
the merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of
doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine
persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights
with respect to the shares of our Class A common stock unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.
Filing Written Demand
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to ForgeRock, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares. In addition, that
person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or
telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any
previously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold, beneficially or of
record, the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares through
the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the
merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing
to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from
any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement will not constitute a demand. A person’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote
on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably inform
ForgeRock of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must
reasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made, be accompanied by documentary
evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of such stock and a statement that such documentary
evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the Verified List (as defined
below).
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
ForgeRock, Inc.
201 Mission Street, Suite 2900
San Francisco, California 94105
Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and accept
the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, by delivering to ForgeRock, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to
any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(which we refer to as a “Reservation”) for any Application (as defined below); provided, however, that this shall not
affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the
effective time of the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding with respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such
appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered
pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify
each stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly made a written
demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who
has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving
corporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving
corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not
assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
the shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate
all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and
in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262
could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an
appraisal of such person’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and with respect to which ForgeRock has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that where a beneficial owner
makes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate
stockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate number). Such statement must be given within ten
days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy
thereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service
to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “Verified List”) containing
the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as
to the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time
and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on
the Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.
After notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the hearing on
such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with Section 262 and
who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons
who demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock certificates to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any
person fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
person. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262.
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Given that the shares Class A common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares
remain so listed up until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal
proceedings as to all holders of shares of our Class A common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to our Class A
common stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking
appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be
paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date
of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time
prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to
each person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount paid
by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the
date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair
value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the
date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm
as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and
may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. ALTHOUGH FORGEROCK BELIEVES THAT THE
PER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF
FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD
RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR
LOWER THAN, OR THE SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither ForgeRock nor Parent anticipates offering
more than the per share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of ForgeRock and Parent reserves
the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the per
share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to our Class A common stock, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an
appraisal will cease.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any,
by the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such person upon such

terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts)
may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the Verified List who
participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith (which we refer to as an “Application”),
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the
shares entitled to an appraisal that were not dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award
pursuant to a Reservation. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,
or loses or validly withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of our common stock will be
deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share price as
provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person’s right to appraisal if
no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our
Class A common stock, or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance
with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with
Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been
satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our Class A common stock, or if
such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal and
an acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, then the right of such person to an
appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Court deems just, including, without limitation, a Reservation; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as
a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of appraisal rights.
In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the
merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to
exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be
relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock whose shares are converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(which we refer to, as amended, the “Code”), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,
published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our
common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as property held for
investment purposes).
66TABLE OF CONTENTS
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may
be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations,
partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders
in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045
and 1202 of the Code, as “Section 1244 stock” within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through
individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts; Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution)
more than five percent of our common stock; or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term
residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle
or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction
or pursuant to the exercise of ForgeRock options, or ForgeRock RSUs;
•
tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other
entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial
statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
any U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences;
•
any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
•
tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of
their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding
the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would
ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with
respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME
TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is
neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Taxable Sale of Company Capital Stock
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.
Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A
reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder
(including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different
blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and/or different prices, such holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain realized
by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,
such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case
such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty); or
•
ForgeRock is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as “USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year
period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares
of our common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”) and, if shares of our common stock are
regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code),
such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our common
stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the
branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real
property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its
worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this
purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land, improvements
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we
are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-
U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to
them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a
holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-
U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (b)
otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S. federal
income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the
merger.
Additional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued
thereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, “FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain
payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution
enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the
U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which include
certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with
U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain
payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification
identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental
agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under
certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
The U.S. Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would
eliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common
stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may
generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH
HOLDER’S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED ABOVE
TO SUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION
AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.",76,79

General Efforts
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and ForgeRock, on the other hand, agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, do, or cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be
done, all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the merger, including: (1) seeking to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders
and authorizations from governmental authorities; and (2) making all registrations, declarations and filings with
governmental authorities, in each case that are necessary or advisable to consummate the merger.
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
HSR Act; FDI Laws
Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and ForgeRock file a Notification and Report Form
with the FTC and the DOJ, and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.
ForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the
FTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC and the
DOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 of the HSR
Act in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent’s notification and report form was
withdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form on November 28,
2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting commenced period under the HSR Act. Both before and after the expiration
of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust
grounds.
Additionally, under the merger agreement, the merger also cannot be completed until Parent submits the filings under
certain specified FDI laws and all necessary consents, approvals, and filings have been obtained or made, and/or all
waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable governmental
authorities) with respect to the consummation of the merger have expired or otherwise have been terminated under
the jurisdictions in which those FDI filings were submitted. Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock,
submitted the specified FDI filings on October 31, 2022.
ForgeRock and Parent have each agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to (1) supply the other (or cause
the other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC,
the DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing, including FDI
filings, are made; and (2) take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act applicable to the merger or receive approval or clearance for any
FDI filing.
Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring
in any other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business
competes in any material line of business with ForgeRock or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive
agreement relating to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material
delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,
declaration or approval of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering
an order preventing or materially restraining the consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the merger, subject to certain exceptions.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At
any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action
could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of
ForgeRock or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary
to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws or FDI laws applicable to the
merger, offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (1) the sale,
divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (thorough the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
properties, products of business of Parent, ForgeRock and their respective subsidiaries; (2) the termination,
modification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent, ForgeRock,
and their respective subsidiaries; (3) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent,
ForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries; and (4) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent, ForgeRock and
their respective subsidiaries; in each case, so as to allow the consummation of the merger as soon as practicable and
in any event at least three business days prior to the termination date; provided that Parent and Merger Sub need
not, and ForgeRock agreed not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action (A) with

respect to the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
properties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) that, individually or in the aggregate,
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of Parent, ForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Parent agreed to oppose any request for the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment,
decree, injunction or ruling of any governmental authority that would restrain, prevent, or delay any required
consents, clearances, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or termination, non-actions or other
authorizations applicable to the merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any person
in any court or before any governmental authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing
properly any adverse decision or order by any governmental authority. In the event the merger agreement is
terminated under the scenarios described in the third and fourth bullets of the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement,” Parent has agreed to reimburse
ForgeRock for the reasonable and documented advisor costs and expenses of all such actions, including responding
to any requests for information in connection with any filing made under the antitrust laws, up to an aggregate
amount of $7.5 million.
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it
grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory
process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even
preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the
conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on October 10, 2022, following approval thereof by the
ForgeRock Board, certain of ForgeRock’s directors and certain of their affiliates that hold shares of common stock, in
each case solely in their capacities as stockholders of ForgeRock (which we refer to as the “voting agreement
stockholders”), entered into the voting agreements with Parent and ForgeRock. The voting agreements cover
approximately 83.2% of ForgeRock’s outstanding voting power, based on the number of shares of common stock
outstanding as of October 6, 2022.
Under the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of our
common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (2) against (a) any action or agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to ForgeRock’s obligations set forth in the merger
agreement not being satisfied; and (b) any alternative acquisition proposal, or agreement, transaction or other matter
that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with or materially and adversely affect the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The voting
agreement stockholders have also waived appraisal rights in connection with the merger, and have agreed not to raise
certain legal challenges to the merger.
Pursuant to the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed not to, until the termination of
the voting agreements and subject to certain exceptions in the voting agreements, (1) directly or indirectly transfer,
either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any option or other contract, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any transfer, of any of our common stock; (2) deposit any of our common stock into a voting trust, enter
into a voting agreements or arrangement (other than the voting agreements) with respect to our common stock or
grant any proxy or power of attorney (other than the voting agreements) with respect to our common stock; or (3)
enter into any contract or commitment to take any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) or (2).
The voting agreement stockholders’ obligations to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement terminate
automatically upon the earliest to occur of (1) the time that our stockholders adopt the merger agreement; (2) the
effective time of the merger; (3) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (4) the
amendment of any term or provision of the merger agreement that reduces the per share price or changes the form of
consideration payable to the voting agreement stockholders under the merger agreement, without the voting
agreement stockholders’ prior written consent; (5) the occurrence of a change in the ForgeRock Board’s

statement contained false or misleading statements regarding the merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the preliminary proxy statement contains materially
incomplete and misleading information concerning the financial analysis performed by J.P. Morgan in connection with
rendering its fairness opinion. The action seeks, among other things, to (1) enjoin defendants from consummating the
merger unless and until defendants disseminate revised disclosures; (2) rescind the merger or recover damages in the
event that the merger is completed; and (3) reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses.
ForgeRock believes that the stockholder litigation is without merit, but there can be no assurance that ForgeRock will
ultimately prevail in the stockholder litigation or other such lawsuits. Additional lawsuits may be filed before the
special meeting and/or the consummation of the merger.

MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers
in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of
ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the
additional disclosures referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced therein. The
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have
previously formed part of ForgeRock’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and
previously have been disclosed to stockholders in public filings, including our annual proxy statement. These
historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the ForgeRock Board, which
is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of ForgeRock approve the compensation that will or may become payable to
ForgeRock’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger-Interests of ForgeRock’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” in ForgeRock’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”
Our stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding,
advisory vote, the result will not be binding on ForgeRock, the ForgeRock Board or Parent. Further, the underlying
plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive
officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in
accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
The ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting. If stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned
session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies
from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger
agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the special meeting if a
quorum is not present. Finally, the chairperson of the special meeting is permitted by our bylaws to adjourn the
special meeting even if our stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger
agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger
agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not
contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the
parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other
information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from
those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by
confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by ForgeRock in connection with the merger agreement.
In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of
allocating contractual risk between ForgeRock and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as
facts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.
Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the
merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the
merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are
either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to
by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is
described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding ForgeRock, Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the
merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this
document and in our filings with the SEC regarding ForgeRock and our business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub and ForgeRock that is no
later than (a) if the last condition to the closing of the merger to be satisfied or waived is related to (i) waiting periods
or required consents under the HSR Act, (ii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction or any law that, in each case, prevents, materially restrains or materially impairs the
consummation of the merger or (iii) requisite consents, approvals and filings under certain specified FDI laws, the
fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions; (b) if the last condition to the closing of the
merger to be satisfied or waived is any condition except for the ones mentioned in clause (a) above, the third
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of such condition (in each case, other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions); or (2) at such other time agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the
merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided
under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a
later time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.",86,86

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger,
each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger (other than the excluded shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the per share price without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the terms
of the merger agreement).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is (1) held by ForgeRock as treasury
stock, (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid in exchange therefor. At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of our common stock of the surviving corporation and each certificate representing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common
stock of the surviving corporation.
Treatment of Equity Awards; ESPP
The merger agreement provides that ForgeRock’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:
Treatment of ForgeRock Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time of the merger each vested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal in value to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B
common stock subject to such vested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time or the merger, multiplied
by (2) the per share price, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total
number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested ForgeRock RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the per share price, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each Converted Cash Award will
continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding unvested ForgeRock RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that terms rendered inoperable by the transactions
contemplated by the transaction documents entered into connection with the merger will no longer have any force or
effect.
Treatment of ForgeRock Options
At the effective time of the merger, each vested ForgeRock option will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common
stock subject to the vested ForgeRock option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the per
share exercise price of such vested ForgeRock option, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger each unvested ForgeRock option will be converted into the contingent right to
receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total number of shares of
our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the per share exercise
price per of such unvested ForgeRock option, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. Except as
otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such Converted Cash Award will continue to have, and will be
subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of
employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.
Any underwater ForgeRock option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or
payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
From the date of the merger agreement, we have taken and will take all actions necessary to ensure the following with
respect to the ESPP: (1) no new individuals will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP; (2) necessary or advisable
adjustments will be made to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period; (3) no increase in the amount of
participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP will be permitted during the offering period or purchase
period that is in effect on the date of the merger agreement; (4) each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP
will be exercised (but otherwise no other of our Class A common stock under the ESPP will be issued); (5) no further
offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP, and if the effective time of the merger would
otherwise occur before the end of the Current Purchase Period, shorten the Current Purchase Period as of a specified
trading day at least ten days prior to the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs; and (6) not extend the
Current Purchase Period. Immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the
consummation of the merger), we will terminate the ESPP and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the
ESPP after such termination. Of our executive officers, three currently participate in the ESPP. Our non-employee
directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to ForgeRock, which we refer to
as the “payment agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to our stockholders. At or prior to the closing
of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent an amount of cash that is
sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price to our stockholders in accordance with the merger
agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the
surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented
outstanding shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions
advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1)
surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together
with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
be reasonably requested by the payment agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by such certificate
and (y) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to our stockholders will not include interest and
may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to
as “uncertificated shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are
described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. Each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of our common stock will, upon receipt of an “agent’s
message” in customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may reasonably be requested
by the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable,
an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by
such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such
ForgeRock stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the
merger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the
merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation or any other party will be liable to any of
our stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the
payment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the
payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation
or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.",88,89

During the no-shop period, ForgeRock agreed to, and agreed to (1) cause its subsidiaries and its executive officers
and directors, (2) instruct its legal and financial advisors and (3) use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its
representatives to, in each case, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and

In particular, under and subject to the terms of the merger agreement, during the no-shop period ForgeRock, its

any of its subsidiaries’ other employees, consultants or other representatives to, directly or indirectly:

Under and subject to the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until ForgeRock
received the requisite stockholder approval, ForgeRock and the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) may,
directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives (including its financial advisor), (1) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) subject to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, (a) furnish any
non-public information relating to ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries to or (b) afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information or to any personnel, of ForgeRock or any of its
subsidiaries to; or (3) otherwise facilitate the making of a superior proposal by, in each case, any person or group or
their respective representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to ForgeRock an acquisition proposal after the
date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach of the applicable restrictions. ForgeRock and the
ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) may only take the actions in the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3) if the
ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that (A) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably
likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (B) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. From the date of the merger agreement until the
earlier to occur of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, ForgeRock has agreed
that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if any
acquisition proposal is, to the knowledge of ForgeRock, received by ForgeRock or its representatives of any non-
public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
ForgeRock or any of its representatives, which requests discussions or negotiations that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the person or group making
such proposal, or request (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement
86TABLE OF CONTENTS
with such person or group that is in effect on the date of the merger agreement); (ii) a summary of the material terms
and conditions of such proposal or request and, if in writing, a copy thereof; and (iii) copies of any material
agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith. Thereafter, ForgeRock must
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material development),
of the status and terms of any such proposal and of any such discussions or negotiations, including providing
copies of any new or amended agreements documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any written acquisition
proposal on terms that the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to our
stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the merger (taking into account (1) any revisions to the merger
agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination; and (2) those factors and
matters deemed relevant in good faith by the ForgeRock Board (or any committee thereof), which factors may include
the (a) identity of the person making the proposal, (b) likelihood of consummation in accordance with the terms of
such acquisition proposal and (c) legal, financial (including the financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects
of such acquisition proposal. For purposes of the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition, all
references to “15 percent” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50.1

The ForgeRock Board has recommended that the holders of shares of our common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, except as set forth below, at no time after the date of the
merger agreement may the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the ForgeRock Board recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent (it being understood that it
shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent if (1) any acquisition proposal structured as a tender
or exchange offer is commenced and the ForgeRock Board fails to publicly recommend against acceptance
of such tender or exchange offer by our stockholders within ten business days of commencement thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act, or (2) any acquisition proposal is publicly announced (other
than by commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the ForgeRock Board fails to issue a public press
release within ten business days of such public announcement providing that the ForgeRock Board
reaffirms the ForgeRock Board recommendation);
•
adopt, approve or recommend an acquisition proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the ForgeRock Board recommendation within ten business days of the occurrence
of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the ForgeRock stockholder
meeting is scheduled to be held within ten business days, then within one business day after Parent so
requests in writing) (it being understood that ForgeRock will not be obligated to affirm the ForgeRock
Board recommendation on more than two occasions);

against such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” communication by the ForgeRock Board (or a
committee thereof) to our stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the ForgeRock Board (or a committee
thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern
time, on the tenth business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with
such acquisition proposal without such action being considered a violation of the merger agreement);

fail to include the ForgeRock Board recommendation in the proxy statement (we refer to the actions
described in these five bullets as a “ForgeRock Board recommendation change”); or
•
cause or permit ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.
87TABLE OF CONTENTS
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, other than in connection with a written acquisition
proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a ForgeRock
Board recommendation change in response to an intervening event if and only if:
•
the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the ForgeRock Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
ForgeRock has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three business days in advance to the effect
that the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) so determined and (2) resolved to effect a
ForgeRock Board recommendation change, which notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such
ForgeRock Board recommendation change and will describe the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such ForgeRock Board recommendation change, ForgeRock and its representatives, until
5:00 p.m., Eastern time, at the end of such period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so that the ForgeRock Board (or a
committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a ForgeRock Board
recommendation change in response to such intervening event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the ForgeRock Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and (3)
following such three business day period, the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents) has determined that the
failure of the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) to make a ForgeRock Board recommendation
change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
law, it being understood that each time that material modifications or developments with respect to the
intervening event occur ForgeRock has agreed to notify Parent of such modification and the three business
day period will recommence and be extended for two business days from the later of (A) the delivery of
such written notice to Parent or (B) the end of the original three business day notice period.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if ForgeRock has received a written acquisition
proposal that the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, then the ForgeRock Board may (1) effect a
ForgeRock Board recommendation change with respect to such superior proposal; or (2) authorize ForgeRock to
terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior
proposal, in each case if and only if:
•
the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the ForgeRock Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
ForgeRock has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with
respect to such acquisition proposal;
•
ForgeRock has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance (which we
refer to as the “notice period”) to the effect that the ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) has (1)
received a written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal constitutes
a superior proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a ForgeRock Board recommendation change or to terminate
the merger agreement, which notice describes the basis for such ForgeRock Board recommendation change
or termination, including the identity of the person or group making such acquisition proposal, the material
terms of such acquisition proposal and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such
acquisition proposal; and
•
prior to effecting such ForgeRock Board recommendation change or termination, ForgeRock and its
representatives, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the notice period, have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
88
TABLE OF CONTENTS
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so that
such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the ForgeRock Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), and (A)
in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to such acquisition proposal,
ForgeRock agreed to be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of the merger agreement with respect to such new written notice (with the “notice period” in
respect of such new written notice being two business days from the later of (i) the delivery of such written
notice to Parent or (ii) the end of the original notice period); and (B) at the end of the notice period, the
ForgeRock Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement) reaffirmed its determination that such acquisition proposal is a
superior proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “intervening event” means any effect, or any
material consequence of such effect, that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known or reasonably
foreseeable, in each case based on facts known to the ForgeRock Board as of the date of the merger agreement; and
(2) does not relate to (a) an acquisition proposal or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that ForgeRock meets or exceeds
any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the merger agreement, or changes after the date of the
merger agreement in the market price or trading volume of our Class A common stock or the credit rating of
ForgeRock (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be
considered and taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred).

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will honor all ForgeRock benefit plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that the surviving
corporation is permitted to amend or terminate ForgeRock benefit plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required by applicable law.
For the Benefits Period, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will:
•
maintain employee benefits for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (other than the Excluded Benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at ForgeRock or its subsidiaries on the
date of the merger agreement;
•
provide an annual base salary or wage rate, and target annual cash bonus opportunity to each Continuing
Employee that is substantially the same in the aggregate to that provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which will not, in the aggregate, be decreased during
the Benefits Period; and
•
provide to Continuing Employees cash severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment
(subject to satisfying any requirements required by Parent) that are substantially the same as those
provided by ForgeRock and its subsidiaries as of the date of the merger agreement.
At or after the effective time of the merger, Parent, the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Continuing Employees to receive credit for all service (1) with ForgeRock
and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger, and (2) with Parent, the surviving corporation, and any of
their subsidiaries on or after the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement (but not including for any
Excluded Benefits), to the same extent such service was credited under the corresponding ForgeRock benefit plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the date of the merger agreement.

Additionally, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that:
•
each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate in the New Plans sponsored by Parent
and its subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Benefits) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New
Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Old Plan;
•
for purposes of New Plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, cause all pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the same extent waived under the
corresponding ForgeRock benefit plan;
•
during the plan year in which the closing of the merger occurs, cause any eligible expenses paid by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to

HSR Act; FDI laws
ForgeRock and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other
to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ, or
the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction, including in support of any FDI laws, in which any
such filing is made; and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as
practicable, (a) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other antitrust laws, or FDI laws, applicable to the merger, and (b) obtain any required consents pursuant to any
antitrust laws, or FDI laws applicable to the merger.
ForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the
FTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC and the
DOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 of the HSR
Act in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent’s notification and report form was
withdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form on November 28,
2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting period commenced under the HSR Act. Both before and after the expiration
of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust
grounds.
Additionally, Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock, submitted the specified FDI filings on
October 31, 2022.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to
the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws, or FDI laws, applicable to the merger, but subject to the terms of the merger
agreement, (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (a) the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub , on the one hand, and
ForgeRock and its subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (b) certain other restrictions on the activities of Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and ForgeRock and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, provided that Parent and
Merger Sub need not, and ForgeRock agreed not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect
any action (A) with respect to the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) that, individually
90TABLE OF CONTENTS
or in the aggregate, would, or would result in a material adverse effect to the business, financial condition or results
of operations of Parent, ForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (2) contest, defend and
appeal any legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the
consummation of the merger.
Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring in any
other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business competes in
any material line of business with ForgeRock or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive agreement relating
to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval
of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering an order preventing or
materially restraining the consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise; or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the merger, subject to
certain exceptions.
Equity Financing
Under the merger agreement, Parent agreed to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper and advisable to obtain the equity financing on the terms and conditions described in the
equity commitment letter, including by:
•
maintaining in effect the equity commitment letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof;
•
complying with its obligations under the equity commitment letter;
•
satisfying on a timely basis the conditions to funding the equity financing in the equity commitment letter
that are within Parent and Merger Sub’s control;
•
consummating the equity financing at or prior to the closing, including causing the Thoma Bravo Fund to
fund the equity financing at the closing;
•
complying with its obligations pursuant to the equity commitment letter; and
•
enforcing its rights pursuant to the equity commitment letter.
Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to seek to enforce, including by bringing a legal proceeding for specific
performance, the equity commitment letter if ForgeRock seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of the
obligation to consummate the merger after all applicable conditions to the granting thereof set forth in the merger
agreement have been satisfied.

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, honor and
fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of ForgeRock and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
entered into prior to the effective time of the merger between ForgeRock and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director, officer of
ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger), on the other hand (we refer to such
persons collectively as the “indemnified persons”). In addition, under the merger agreement, during the period
commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the merger,
the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of ForgeRock
and the subsidiaries of ForgeRock, as applicable, as of the date of the merger agreement. During such six-year period
or such period in which an indemnified person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger
agreement, whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified persons except as required by applicable law.

Furthermore, during the period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation has agreed to (and Parent has agreed to cause the
surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by ForgeRock’s governing and
organizational documents in effect on the date of the merger agreement or pursuant to any indemnification agreement
with ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of the effective time of the merger, each indemnified person from
and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such legal proceeding arises,
directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer, or agent of ForgeRock or any of its subsidiaries
or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at
or after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by ForgeRock, Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to the merger (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its
subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent). If prior
the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the merger, any indemnified person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement, then the claim asserted in such notice will
survive the sixth-anniversary until such claim is fully and finally resolved.
Prior to the effective time of the merger, ForgeRock has agreed to purchase a prepaid six-year “tail” policy with
respect to the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to) maintain the tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as the tail policy is in full force and effect.

The Board of Directors
ForgeRock, Inc.
201 Mission St., Suite 2900
San Francisco, CA 94105
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Class A Common Stock”), and the holders of Class B Common
Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Company Class A
Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”), of ForgeRock, Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid
to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Project Fortress Parent, LLC (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”),
among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Project Fortress Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), the
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror or Merger Sub, and Dissenting Company Shares (as
defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $23.25 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated October 10, 2022 of the Agreement; (ii)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in
which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial
terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v)
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its
business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we
deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that
the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the
related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We
have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion
and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock
in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to (i) the fairness of any consideration to be paid in
connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company, (ii) the allocation of the aggregate Consideration to be paid to all holders of Company Common Stock
between the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of the
Consideration to the holders of any shares of the Company Common Stock, or (iii) the underlying decision by the
Company to engage in the Transaction. We also do not express any opinion as to the voting rights associated with
the Class B Common Stock or any governance or other rights of the holders thereof (and have not taken any such
rights into account in our analysis). Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons
relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with
respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with the Company and certain portfolio companies of Thoma Bravo, L.P. (an affiliate
of the Acquiror) (“TB”), for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services
during such period have included (i) acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Company’s initial public offering in
October 2021 and (ii) providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio
companies of TB unrelated to the Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a
lender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of TB, for which it receives customary compensation
or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the
outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we
and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,
bank loans or other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror or TB and its portfolio companies for our own account
or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities
or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid
to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This
letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information
statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without
our prior written approval.
Very truly yours,
J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC

(a) References to this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) when a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, that reference is to an Article, Section,
A-13TABLE OF CONTENTS
Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) references to “paragraphs” or “clauses” are to separate
paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the reference occurs. References to this Agreement (in
this Agreement or any Transaction Document) mean this Agreement as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time in accordance with Section 9.3.
(b) Hereof, Including, etc. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith”
and words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement; (ii) the phrase “the date hereof” means “the date of this Agreement;”
and (iii) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
“without limitation.”
(c) Threats. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, the word “threat” or “threatened” will
be deemed to be immediately followed by the words “in writing.”
(d) Neither, etc. Not Exclusive. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, “neither,” “nor,”
“any,” “either” and “or” are not exclusive. The rule known as the ejusdem generis rule will not apply, and accordingly,
general words introduced by the word “other” will not be given a restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they
are preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.
(e) Extent. The phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does
not simply mean “if.”
(f) Dollars. When used in this Agreement, references to “$” or “Dollars” are references to United States
dollars. All amounts in this Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses incurred by
any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a currency other than Dollars, to the extent applicable, the
Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be determined by converting such other currency to Dollars
at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source
reasonably determined by the Company, in effect at the time that such amount, cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the
resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond two decimal points, it will be rounded to the nearest
penny.
(g) Meaning of Terms. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this Agreement
is equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender include
all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms has a
corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined in such
certificate or document. References to the “United States” or abbreviations thereof mean the United States of
America and its states, territories and possessions.
(h) References to Persons. References to any Person (including any Party) include references to such
Person’s successors and permitted assigns, and, in the case of any Governmental Authority, to any Person
succeeding to its functions and capacities. It is agreed that a breach of this Agreement by Merger Sub will be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.
(i) References to Subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to the
Subsidiaries of a Person will be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person.
(j) Writings. References to “writing” mean the representation or reproduction of words, symbols or other
information in a visible form by any method or combination of methods, whether in electronic form or otherwise, and
including writings delivered by Electronic Delivery. “Written” will be construed in the same manner.
(k) Legislation; Contracts. A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any legislation
includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision
substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto,
except that, for purposes of any representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific date,
references to any specific legislation will be deemed to refer to such legislation or provision (and all rules,
regulations, statutory instruments and applicable guidance, guidelines, bulletins or policies issued or made in
connection therewith by a Governmental Authority) as of such date. References to any agreement or Contract are to
that agreement or Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, and any exhibits, schedules,
annexes, statements of work, riders and other documents attached thereto.

a covenant under the terms of this Agreement, other than the acknowledgments and agreements set forth in Section
3.28 and Section 4.13 to the extent necessary to give full effect to the acknowledgments and agreements set forth
therein.
(r) Joint Drafting. The Parties agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties irrevocably waive the application of any Law,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.

this Agreement that is prepared by or on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or such Exhibit, Schedule or document.
(t) No Admission. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Company Disclosure Letter is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained in this Agreement or in the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever,
including (i) any violation of Law or breach of contract; or (ii) that such information is material or is required to be
referred to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of any information or document in the Company Disclosure
Letter is not a statement or admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter.
Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter constitutes an admission against the Company’s interest or represents the
Company’s legal position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this Agreement to dollar amount
thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect,
as applicable, or materiality.

amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that such

the
A-15

ordinary course of business. In each case, no Party may use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Company Disclosure Letter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement or whether any obligation, item or matter included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business.
(v) No Reliance by Others on Representations. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.
(w) Made Available. The phrases “furnished,” “provided,” “delivered” or “made available” or words of
similar import when used with respect to documents or other information means that such documents or information

holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:
(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate representing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation;

owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid in exchange therefor; and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, if any) will be

automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $23.25, without interest thereon (the “Per
Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11).
(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock distribution or dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
(i) Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a Company Stockholder who has (A) neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or the Merger
nor consented thereto in writing and (B) properly demanded appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the
“Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price
pursuant to this Section 2.7 but instead will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.
Such Company Stockholder will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. However, if, after the Effective Time, such
Company Stockholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or waives, or otherwise loses such holder’s right to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares
of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with this Agreement and will not thereafter
be deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares.
(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares; and (B)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer
to settle any such demands for payment in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section
2.7(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
affected) and may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, but Parent will not be afforded any
decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise
consent set forth above.

(i) Vested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit subject to
time-based vesting (each, a “Company RSU”) under the applicable Company Equity Plan that is vested at the
Effective Time (but not yet settled) or that vests as a result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (each, a “Vested Company RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted solely into the right to receive an amount (without interest) in cash equal
in value to (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested Company RSU Consideration”). Following the Effective Time, no
such Vested Company RSU that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding,
and each former holder of a Vested Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the
right (if any) to receive the Vested Company RSU Consideration in exchange for such Vested Company RSU in
accordance with this Section 2.8(a)(i).
A-18TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU under the
applicable Company Equity Plan that is not a Vested Company RSU (each, an “Unvested Company RSU”) will,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted solely
into the contingent right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest) (a
“Converted Cash Award”) equal to (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8, each
such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to have, and will be
subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of
employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that terms rendered inoperable by the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents will
no longer have any force or effect. Following the Effective Time, no such Unvested Company RSU that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of an Unvested
Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right (if any) to receive a Converted
Cash Award in exchange for such Unvested Company RSU in accordance with this Section 2.8(a)(ii). Any such
conversion and assumption will be effected in a manner that complies with, or is exempt from, the requirements of
Code Section 409A.
(b) Company Options.
(i) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is vested
at the Effective Time, or that vests as a result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(each, a “Vested Company Option”), will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted solely into the right to receive an amount (without interest) in cash, equal in
value to (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Vested Company Option multiplied
by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Vested Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment
(the “Vested Company Option Consideration”). For the avoidance of doubt, any Vested Company Option that has an
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Price will be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment and without further action on the part of any Person.
Following the Effective Time, no Vested Company Option shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of a
Vested Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right (if any) to receive the
Vested Company Option Consideration in exchange for such Vested Company Option in accordance with this Section
2.8(b)(i).
(ii) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is not
a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted solely into the contingent right to receive from Parent or
the Surviving Corporation a Converted Cash Award equal in value to (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such
Unvested Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this
Section 2.8 will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including
acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding
Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any Unvested
Company Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the
Per Share Price will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment and without further action on
the part of any Person. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested Company Option shall remain outstanding, and
each former holder of an Unvested Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for
the right (if any) to receive the Converted Cash Award in exchange for such Unvested Company Option in
accordance with this Section 2.8(b)(ii). Any such conversion and assumption will be effected in a manner that
complies with, or is exempt from, the requirements of Code Section 409A.
(c) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Vested Company RSU
Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company RSUs and (ii) Vested Company Option Consideration owed

TABLE OF CONTENTS
to all holders of Vested Company Options. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in
no event later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date, the applicable former holders
of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of the Vested Company Option Consideration and Vested Company
RSU Consideration required to be paid to such former holders pursuant to this Section 2.8. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Vested Company RSUs or Vested Company Options pursuant to this
Section 2.8 cannot be made through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight
courier to such holder as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation will
pay any portion of a Converted Cash Award that vests to the applicable holder thereof as soon as reasonably
practicable, but no later than 30 days following the date on which such portion vests.
(d) Necessary Further Actions. The Company will take all action within its power and authority reasonably
necessary to effect the cancellation, conversion and/or assumption (as the case may be) of Company Equity-Based
Awards as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of
Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to obtaining any required consents from the holders
thereof, all Company Equity-Based Awards and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time (but
subject to the consummation of the Merger).
(e) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
actions necessary to, (A) provide that no new individuals will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP following the date of
this Agreement; (B) make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering
period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective
and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) not allow any increase in
the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during the offering period or purchase period
that is in effect on the date of this Agreement from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (D) cause the
exercise (as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP, but otherwise not issue any Company Class A Common Stock
under the ESPP; (E) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP
upon or after the date of this Agreement, and if the Effective Time would otherwise occur before the end of the
current purchase period under the ESPP (the “Current Purchase Period”), the Company will shorten the Current
Purchase Period as of a specified trading day at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which the Effective Time
occurs and (F) not extend the Current Purchase Period. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds
credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the
Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP and no further
rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.",136,138

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such
holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30
days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &
Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that
(A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes
for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment
A-20TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income
from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one Business
Day), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company
Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11)); and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the
Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price.
The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of
Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so
surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the
holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective
Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable)
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s
transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Uncertificated
Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii).
Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish
procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date
an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company
A-21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price
(such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date,
then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with
respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are
registered.
(f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in
respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred
their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price
to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.",138,140

of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and
(b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common
Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor
in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)).
The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates

on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and

reporting” (in each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act).
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC;

financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Since December 31, 2021, and through the date of this Agreement, to the

assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, and conclude,
after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since the Lookback Date, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have each made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such
certifications.

2021 has maintained, a system of internal accounting controls that are effective in all material respects in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Company’s management and
the Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Since September 15, 2021, neither the Company
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has identified
or been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness (each as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the

(a) Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, correct and complete copy of an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, between
Parent and Guarantor (as amended or replaced, and including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to
such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement, the “Equity Commitment Letter”) pursuant to which Guarantor
has committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding all amounts payable by Parent and/or Merger Sub under this
Agreement at the Closing in connection with the Merger and the transactions pursuant thereto (the “Equity
Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that (i) the Company is an express third party beneficiary
thereof in connection with the Company’s exercise of its rights under Section 9.10(b); (ii) subject to Section 9.10(b),
Parent and Guarantor have waived any defenses to the enforceability of such third party beneficiary rights; and (iii)
Parent and Guarantor will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in

remedy at law.

the Equity Financing have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement; (ii) no such amendment
or modification is contemplated; and (iii) the commitments contained in the Equity Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded in any respect, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation or
rescission is contemplated. There are no Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding, investing or use, as applicable, of the Equity Financing, other than the
Equity Commitment Letter. There are no Contracts, agreements, side letters or other written arrangements that would
permit the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter to reduce the amount of the Equity Financing, impose additional
conditions precedent or that would otherwise materially affect the availability of the Equity Financing on the Closing
Date.
(c) Sufficiency of Financing. The aggregate amounts committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter
are sufficient to (i) make all payments at the Closing contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger
(including the payment of all amounts payable at the Closing pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result
of the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to the Merger) the principal of and accrued and
unpaid interest on, and all other indebtedness outstanding pursuant to, the Loan Agreement; and (iii) pay all fees
and expenses of the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger.
(d) Validity; No Contrary Expectation. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the executed form delivered by
Parent to the Company, (i) as of the date of this Agreement is in full force and effect and (ii) constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, as applicable, enforceable against
Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, except, in each case, as

enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Limitations. Other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding, investing or use
of the full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to any agreement relating to the Equity Financing to which
Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. No party to the Equity Commitment
Letter has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, the
Equity Commitment Letter. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of any
party to the Equity Commitment Letter; (ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter required to be complied with or satisfied by the parties to the Equity
Commitment Letter; (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect; or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing not being
available, when required pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that (A) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Equity Commitment Letter to be satisfied by it; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter will not be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letter to
be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to
be fully paid, all applicable fees, expenses, premiums and charges that are due and payable on or prior to the date of

Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that was not solicited in material breach of Section 5.4(a). The Company and the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may only take the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence if the Company Board (or a

counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.4(b) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.

of a tender or exchange offer) and the Company Board fails to issue a public press release within 10 Business Days of
such public announcement providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation); (B)
adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so

Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern
time, on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.4); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a
“Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in itself by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery, in itself, by the Company to Parent or its Representatives of any notice
contemplated by Section 5.4(d); or (3) the public disclosure, in itself, of the items in clauses (1) and (2) if required by
applicable Law will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.4; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(d) Permissible Company Board Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(i) Intervening Events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, other than in connection with a written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if and only if:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days (the

which notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and will
describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

Representatives, until 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, at the end of such four (4) Business Day period, have (A) negotiated
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and (C) following such Event Notice Period, the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into
account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents)
has determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
A-45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
applicable Law; it being understood that each time that material modifications or developments with respect to the
Intervening Event occur (as reasonably determined by the Company Board in good faith), the Company shall notify
Parent of such modification and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be
extended for two Business Days from the later of (i) the delivery of such written notice to Parent or (ii) the end of the
original Notice Period.
(ii) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.4 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in

financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C)
resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(h), which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination,
including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal (unless any
such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that
is in effect on the date of this Agreement); and
(4) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company
and its Representatives, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the last day of the Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material
revision, amendment, update or supplement to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d)(ii)(4) with respect to such new
written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being two Business Days from the later
of (i) the delivery of such written notice to Parent or (ii) the end of the original Notice Period); and (b) at the end of
the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents) reaffirmed its determination described in clause (1)
above that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice to Parent of Acquisition Proposals. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly
(and, in any event within 48 hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if an Acquisition Proposal is, to
the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will be deemed to include each member of the Company
Board and will not be deemed to be only as of the date of this Agreement), received by the Company or its
Representatives or any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives, which requests, discussions or negotiations
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include (A) the identity of the
Person or Group making such proposal or request (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any
confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); (B) a summary
of the material terms and conditions of such proposal or request and, if in writing, a copy thereof; and (C) copies of
A-46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any material agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith. Thereafter, the
Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material
development with regard to or material amendment of such proposal or request), of the status and terms of any such
proposal (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including
providing copies of any new or amended material agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in
connection therewith. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any such Person or Group or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent or its
Representatives.
(f) Permitted Disclosures by the Company and the Company Board. So long as the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such public disclosure (other than in
a customary “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act):
(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including
making a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company

communication); (B) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (C)

Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law, it being understood that (1) any such
statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.4(f)(i) must
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise adversely affect the
obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this
Section 5.4; and (2) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 5.4(c);
and
(ii) it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that solely (A) describes the Company’s
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal; (C)
provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto will not, in any case, be deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification or
modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation Change.
(g) Breach of No-Solicitation Obligations by Representatives of the Company. The Company agrees that if
it (i) affirmatively permits any of its Representatives (other than its non-controlled Affiliates that are not directors,
officers or employees of the Company) to take any action or (ii) is made aware of an action by one of its
Representatives (other than its non-controlled Affiliates that are not directors, officers or employees of the
Company)and does not use its reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate such action and, in each case, such
action would constitute a material breach of this Section 5.4 if taken by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period,
then such action will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.4.

best efforts to (A) take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (B) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (C) assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or

impairing or materially delaying or otherwise materially and adversely affecting the (i) consummation of the Merger;
or (ii) ability of such Party to fully perform its covenants pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no
action by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub taken (or failed to be taken) in compliance with the express terms of
this Agreement will be considered a violation of this Section 6.1.

reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with
the other Parties, an appropriate response to such request, and cooperate and coordinate with the other Parties in
connection with responding to any such request. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will not, and will cause their
respective Affiliates not to, (a) “pull-and-refile” pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 or otherwise withdraw any filing under

businesses of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) the termination, modification, or assignment
of existing relationships, joint ventures, Contracts, or obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries; (iii) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries, and (iv) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries, in each case, so as to allow the consummation of the Merger as soon as practicable, and in

prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action (x) with respect to the capital stock or other equity or
voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of Affiliates of
Parent or Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub), or (y) that, individually or in the aggregate, would, or
would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent shall oppose any
request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of
any Governmental Authority that would restrain, prevent or delay any required consents, clearances, approvals,
waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or terminations, non-actions or other authorizations applicable to the
Merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any Person in any court or before any
Governmental Authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing properly any adverse decision
or order by any Governmental Authority, and in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c), Parent shall reimburse the Company for the reasonable and documented advisor costs and
expenses of all such actions, including responding to any requests for information in connection with any filing made

Request for Additional Information (a Second Request) issued to the parties pursuant to the HSR Act, up to an
aggregate amount of $7,500,000 (the “Antitrust Reimbursement Obligations”). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

agreement or consent decree with any Governmental Authority that is not conditioned on the Closing.

communications (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents
submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties

non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and any
such information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of the Party

Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the

Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection
with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal
Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with a Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this

expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any
counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable

to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable
standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid six-year “tail” policy
(the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the total cost for the Tail Policy
does not exceed 400 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, it being
understood that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable up to such limit. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so
long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person.
(e) No Impairment; Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the
Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the
D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of
enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who
are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii)
the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements
entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.

respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 are joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair
any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification
agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.",174,176

(a) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans made available to Parent in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates from amending, modifying, or terminating any Company Benefit Plans or compensation
or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or as otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(b) Employment; Benefits. For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the one-year
anniversary thereof, or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the Continuing Employee (the “Benefits Period”), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) (i) maintain employee benefits for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (other than defined benefit pension,
retiree welfare, and the opportunity to participate in equity or equity-based or other long term incentive
compensation, change of control, retention, transaction bonus or similar arrangements, defined benefit pension,
retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (collectively, the “Excluded Benefits”))
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries
A-58TABLE OF CONTENTS
on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) provide an annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target annual
cash bonus opportunity to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, is substantially the same in the
aggregate to that provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base
compensation and target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities will not, in the aggregate, be decreased
during the Benefits Period for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. During the Benefits Period, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees
with cash severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment (and subject to satisfying any
requirements required by Parent) that are substantially the same as those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement under the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) New Plans. At or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to the Continuing
Employees credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but
not including for any purposes of any Excluded Benefits, to the same extent such service was credited under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the date
hereof, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits or could apply to any defined benefit pension plans. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Excluded Benefits) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces
coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, cause all pre-existing conditions or
limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the same extent waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and, during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, cause any eligible expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, will not be subject to
accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.
(d) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither this Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time (or any particular term of employment), or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee or other Person
for any or no reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain
or continue any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy agreement or
arrangement or prevent the amendment, modification, suspension or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii)
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to
amend, any Company Benefit Plan.

(a) Manner of Termination. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other than
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable
detail the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and
circumstances forming the basis for such termination.
(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective
immediately upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the
terminating Party to the other Parties, as applicable. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other
Representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2,
that Section 6.6(e), Section 6.6(f), Section 6.14, Section 8.3, Article IX (other than Section 9.10(b)) and this Section 8.2
will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to Section 8.3, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party
from any liability for any intentional common law fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the
termination of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, which rights, obligations
and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",183,183
"ForgeRock, Inc._20221208_DEFM14A_20498573_4557310.Pdf",Fees and Expenses,"Fees and Expenses.
(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and
expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(e), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer,
stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each
case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) by
Parent at a time when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has not been obtained, Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e);
A-65TABLE OF CONTENTS
(B) at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.1(d) have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would
be satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e),
an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise
abandoned; and (D) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or
Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition
Transaction is subsequently consummated at any time, then the Company will, concurrently with the consummation
of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which
Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15
percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50.1 percent.”
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid
to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the
Company must, concurrently with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which
Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(c) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the
Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination
Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee, if, as and when required to be paid
pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company
for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(a) then the Company will pay or cause to be paid to the other party the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’
fees) of Parent in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at
an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal (or other authoritative source to the
extent no such figure is published by The Wall Street Journal) on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received,
or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, “Enforcement Expenses”).
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
(A) the Company’s receipt of the Reimbursement Obligations and the Company’s right to specific performance
pursuant to Section 9.10(b) (solely with respect to specifically enforcing its rights under Section 8.2 and this Section
8.3) and the Company’s rights under the Guarantee will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company Related
Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to
consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure, and, (B) upon payment

any of the Company Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters
forming the basis of such termination, except that, in each case (x) the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both)
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect
to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2 and Section 8.3(a), as applicable; and (y) Guarantor will remain
obligated, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor from any
liability (1) for any intentional common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Parent Related Parties (including for any Willful
Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement, the
Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, exceed an amount,
in the aggregate, equal to $140,000,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations (such aggregate amount, the “Parent
Liability Limitation”) or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; or (3) pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as
applicable. In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in
excess of the Parent Liability Limitation (except for intentional common law fraud or pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable) against the Parent Related Parties, and, other than with
respect to intentional common law fraud or pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
as applicable, in no event will any Company Related Parties be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of
any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation
against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Merger, the Equity Commitment Letter,
the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Guarantee, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure. Nothing in this Section 8.3(e)(ii) will preclude any liability of the Debt Financing
Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or limit
the Company (following the Closing), Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain
equitable relief from or with respect to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to
the Debt Financing. In no event will any Parent Related Party other than Guarantor (solely as and to the extent
provided in the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter), Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary
damages to the Company or any other Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger.
(ii) For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), any Enforcement
Expenses and Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10(b) will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the
termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger. Upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) and any Enforcement Expenses, none of the Company Related
Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties or any other Person relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, except that the Parties or their
respective Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.2 and Section 8.3(a), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(ii) will not relieve the Company from any liability (1) for any intentional common law
fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages
payable by the Company for breaches (including for any Willful Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount, in the aggregate, equal to the amount of the Company
Termination Fee plus any Enforcement Expenses (such aggregate amount, the “Company Liability Limitation”) or (2)
for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; or (3) pursuant to Section 8.3(a). In no event will any of the Parent
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their
behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation (except for
intentional common law fraud, pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable)
against the Company Related Parties, and, other than with respect to intentional common law fraud, pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be
entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect

respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or

of doubt, other than the obligations of the Company provided in this Agreement, no Company Related Party or any
