majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon (the “Company
stockholder approval”). Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote
is a condition to the consummation of the merger. The approval of the proposal to approve, by advisory
(non-binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the consummation of the merger (the “advisory compensation proposal”)
requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at
the special meeting. The approval of the proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at
the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement (the “adjournment proposal”) requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting (whether or not a quorum is
present). Approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal is not a
condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement
proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice
versa.
Voting by Company Directors, Executive Officers and Principal
Securityholders
(page 37)
As of October 18, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the
aggregate 325,199 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 1.1% of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock as of October 18, 2022. Although none of the directors or executive
officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger agreement proposal, we currently expect that each of
these individuals will vote all of his or her shares “FOR” each of the proposals to be presented at the
special meeting.
The Merger; Certain Effects of the Merger; Consideration To Be Received in
the Merger
(page 43, page 74 and page 96)
On August 4, 2022, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and MergerCo,
providing for, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of specified conditions,
the acquisition of the Company by Parent at a price of $102.50, without interest, per share of Company
common stock issued and outstanding (the “merger consideration”). Subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, MergerCo will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”),
with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “surviving
corporation”). A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement.
If the merger is consummated, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time the merger is consummated (the “effective time”) will be converted
automatically into, and will thereafter represent only, the right to receive $102.50 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, other than shares of Company common stock that
are (i) owned by the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the effective time or held by
Parent or MergerCo, which will be canceled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the “excluded shares”) and (ii) owned by the Company’s
stockholders

(page 66)
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”) was retained by the Company to act as its financial
advisor and to render a financial opinion in connection with a potential sale of the Company. The
Company selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s
experience in transactions similar to the merger, qualifications, expertise and reputation and its
knowledge of the Company and its business and the industries in which the Company conducts its
business. As part of this engagement, the Board requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement. On August 3, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion to the Board, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 3, 2022, to the effect that, as of
the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and appraisal shares)
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the
Company common stock, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”.
The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion to the Board, dated August 3, 2022, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. The Company stockholders
are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was directed to the Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness,
from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the excluded
shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did
not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions or any term
or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement
entered into or amended in connection therewith and does not address the relative merits of
the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or
whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to,
and does not, constitute an opinion or recommendation as to how the holders of Company
common stock should vote at the special meeting. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion
set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
Morgan Stanley’s opinion.",15,15

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Board was
aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and to recommend that Company
stockholders approve the merger agreement proposal. These interests may include:
the treatment of Company long-term incentive awards provided for under the merger agreement (as
described below in “The Merger Agreement -",17,18

(page 96)
Each long-term incentive award outstanding as of August 4, 2022 will be treated as follows:
each restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company common stock subject to time-based
vesting conditions (each, a “Company RSU”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will
vest and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration
multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company RSU;
each performance-based restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company common stock
subject to both time- and performance-based vesting conditions (each, a “Company PSU”)
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled in exchange for a lump-
sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares subject to
such Company PSU, assuming the maximum level of achievement of any applicable Company PSU
performance criteria (such performance criteria are currently trending at or near the maximum level
irrespective of the transaction); and
each long-term cash incentive award (each, a “Company cash award”) outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time will vest and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to
the amount payable under the applicable award agreement assuming all relevant conditions were
met and the maximum level of achievement of any applicable Company cash award performance
criteria (such performance criteria are currently trending at or near the maximum level irrespective of
the transaction).
With respect to the awards described above, the payments described above will be made, subject to
any applicable withholding taxes, as soon as practicable following the effective time (and in no event
later than the second regular payroll date following the effective time).
With respect to awards granted following August 4, 2022, the awards will be granted in the form of cash
awards (each, a “post-signing cash award”), with such post-signing cash award vesting and being paid
in equal annual installments over the three-year period from the applicable grant date, with accelerated
vesting terms upon a qualifying termination of employment.

On October 7, 2022, a complaint, captioned Stein v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case
No. 1:22-cv-08555, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by
plaintiff Shiva Stein, a purported Company stockholder (the “Stein complaint”), and on October 14, 2022,
a complaint, captioned Okin v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08778, was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by plaintiff Alexander Okin,
a purported Company stockholder, in each case naming as defendants the Company and members of
the Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed a
materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to the merger in violation of Sections 14(a)
and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the
merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly
omitted from the preliminary proxy statement, rescinding the merger agreement or any of the terms
thereof to the extent already implemented or granting rescissory damages, awarding the plaintiff the
costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses,
and granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Stein complaint
additionally seeks an order directing the defendants to account to the plaintiff for all damages suffered
as a result of the alleged wrongdoing.
On October 18, 2022, the Company also received a demand letter from a purported Company
stockholder alleging disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy statement and demanding that the
Company and the Board promptly issue corrective disclosures to cure the proxy statement prior to the
anticipated stockholder vote on the merger.
The Company has not yet formally responded to the complaints or to the demand, but believes that the
allegations contained therein are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement

The consummation of the merger is subject to the requirements of and review under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
“HSR Act”) and the rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). As described below in
the section entitled “- Conditions of the Merger”, the obligations of the parties to effect the merger are
subject to, among other things, the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the merger
under the HSR Act having been terminated or expired and the receipt of certain other regulatory
approvals, including regulatory approvals from the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), as well as antitrust approvals in the European Union, the
People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Japan. Both the Company and Parent filed their
respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on August
12, 2022. On September 12, 2022, Parent withdrew its filing and refiled on September 14, 2022 in order
to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ with an additional 30-day period to review the
filings. The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act expired on
October 14, 2022. The parties also made the required filings with the European Union on September 13,
2022, the People’s Republic of China on September 16, 2022, the Republic of Korea on September 26,
2022 and Japan on September 30, 2022. Antitrust clearance in the People’s Republic of China was
received on October 13, 2022.
The merger agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts
to cause the closing conditions to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to take
certain actions to resolve objections under any applicable laws.
In addition, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any
restraint (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions of the Merger”) that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions, Parent has agreed to (i)
execute settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any
governmental authority or any other person, (ii) sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate
particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of Parent, its subsidiaries or any controlled
affiliate of the foregoing, (iii) agree to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any particular
assets or categories of assets or businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries contemporaneously

(page 79)
If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled
to seek appraisal of their shares of Company common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures
described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their
shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Delaware Court”),
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value”
of your shares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less
than, or the same as, the merger consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the
merger agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a
notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger
consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement.
They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company
common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons
considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company
common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than
the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure
to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the
withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of
the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to
consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (i) continuously holds
such shares through the effective time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the merger
or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under
Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v)
in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the
holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of
such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true
and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive
the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL
MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions
regarding the special meeting, the merger and the merger agreement. These questions and answers may
not address all questions that may be important to you. You should read the more detailed information
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents
referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
On August 4, 2022, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and MergerCo.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, MergerCo will be merged with and into the Company,
with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Parent.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in
favor of the merger agreement proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting
described below under “- What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?”
As a holder of Company common stock, what will I receive in the merger?
If the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $102.50 in cash, without interest and
subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Company common stock that you own
immediately prior to the effective time.
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 88 for a more detailed description of the
United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax
advisor for a full understanding of how the merger will affect your federal, state, local and/or non-U.S.
taxes.
When and where is the special meeting of our stockholders?
The special meeting of Company stockholders will be held on November 29, 2022, at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. In light of ongoing concerns regarding the coronavirus
pandemic, and to support the health and safety of our stockholders, employees and communities,
Company stockholders may only attend the special meeting virtually. The Company stockholders will
not be able to physically attend the special meeting. To access the virtual special meeting, you should
visit http://meetnow.global/MFRXD6X. You will be required to enter a control number, included on your
proxy card, voting instruction form or as you may otherwise receive, which will allow you to participate
in the virtual meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a Company stockholder as of
the record date. We encourage you to access the special meeting before the start time of 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time. Please allow ample time to log into the audio webcast and test your computer
systems.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
Who is entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting?
Only Company stockholders of record at the close of business on October 18, 2022, the record date
for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any
postponement or adjournment thereof. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
28,383,523 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each Company stockholder is
entitled to one vote per share of common stock held by such Company stockholder on the record date
on each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement.
If on October 18, 2022, you were a “record” holder of Company common stock (that is, if you
held Company common stock in your own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer
agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”)), you are entitled to attend and vote at
the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you intend to attend the virtual special meeting,
we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote now, online, by phone or by proxy card to ensure that
your vote is counted.
If on October 18, 2022, you were the beneficial owner of Company common stock held in
“street name” (that is, if you held Company common stock through your bank, broker or other
nominee), then these materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. You may direct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your Company common stock by following the voting
instructions on the form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you hold any Company
common stock through your bank, broker or other nominee and wish to attend the virtual special
meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting but may not be able to vote unless you first
obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from such broker, bank or other nominee. Once you have
received a legal proxy issued in your name from your bank, broker or other nominee, please email a
scan or image of it to Computershare at legalproxy@computershare.com with “Legal Proxy” noted in
the subject line. Upon receipt of your legal proxy, Computershare will provide you with a control
number by email. The cut-off time for requesting a control number is November 21, 2022, five business
days prior to the date of the special meeting, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
For additional information on how to vote at the special meeting, please see the section entitled “The
Special Meeting - Voting Procedures”.
For a description of certain restrictions on voting by Company stockholders who are not “U.S.
citizens”, as defined by applicable laws and regulations, please see the section “The Special
Meeting - Limited Voting by Foreign Owners” of this proxy statement.
At the virtual special meeting and for 10 days prior to the special meeting, the names of Company
stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection for any purpose
germane to the meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, at the
Company’s principal executive offices located at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, New York
10577, by contacting the Secretary of the Company.
What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?
At the special meeting, Company stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:
the merger agreement proposal;

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
the advisory compensation proposal; and
the adjournment proposal.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, “FOR” the advisory
compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of
the merger agreement proposal, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - 
Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 55.
In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement,
you should be aware that some of the Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that
may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company stockholders generally. Please
see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 83.
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?
The holders of a majority of all of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum of Company stockholders
for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting
constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-
votes will not be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum
unless your bank, broker or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the
proposals presented in this proxy statement. If a quorum is not present or represented at the special
meeting of the Company stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or the stockholders entitled to vote
thereat, present in person or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, without notice, if the time
and place of the new meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which Company
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such adjourned meeting,
are announced at the special meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If, however, the adjournment
is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, we will provide a notice of the adjourned meeting to each Company stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special
meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional
proxies.
What vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon.
Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the
consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and
vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company

stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the merger agreement proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by
proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is
present at the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to
vote on a Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of
the advisory compensation proposal.
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a
majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at
the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a
Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the
adjournment proposal. The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger
agreement proposal is approved at the special meeting.
A broker “non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner
does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power
with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, but does
have discretionary voting power over other “routine” items and submits votes for those matters. The
Company does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable
to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide such organization with discretionary authority to
vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
special meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be
permitted to vote your shares of Company common stock at the special meeting without receiving
instructions.
How do the Company’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
As of October 18, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the
aggregate 325,199 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 1.1% of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock as of October 18, 2022. Although none of the directors or
executive officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger agreement proposal, we currently expect
that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares “FOR” each of the proposals to be
presented at the special meeting.
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, my interests as a Company stockholder?
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting of Company stockholders, you
should be aware that the Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the
merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a Company stockholder. The
members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to
approve and declare advisable the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and to recommend that Company
stockholders approve the merger agreement proposal. These interests may include:
the treatment of Company long-term incentive awards provided for under the merger agreement (as
described below in “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Long-Term Incentive
Awards”);

under the terms of individual employment agreements or the Company’s benefits program;
vesting and payment of account balances in the 401(k) Restoration Plan;
the potential to receive an annual bonus for 2022 at the greater of target or actual performance
levels;
the potential grant of cash-based retention awards under a program established for the benefit of
certain Company employees; and
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the organizational
documents of the Company and its subsidiaries and indemnification agreements the Company and
any of its subsidiaries has entered into with each of its directors and executive officers.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger” beginning on page 83.
What will happen to outstanding Company long-term incentive awards in the merger?
Each long-term incentive award outstanding as of August 4, 2022 shall be treated as follows:
each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled
in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the
number of shares subject to such Company RSU;
each Company PSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled
in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the
number of shares subject to such Company PSU, assuming the maximum level of achievement of
any applicable Company PSU performance criteria (such performance criteria are currently
trending at or near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction); and
each Company cash award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be
canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the amount payable under the
applicable award agreement assuming all relevant conditions were met and the maximum level of
achievement of any applicable Company cash award performance criteria (such performance
criteria are currently trending at or near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction).
With respect to the awards described above, the payments described above will be made, subject to
any applicable withholding taxes, as soon as practicable following the effective time (and in no event
later than the second regular payroll date following the effective time).
With respect to each post-signing cash award, such award will vest and be paid in equal annual
installments over the three-year period from the applicable grant date, with such post-signing cash
award vesting and being paid in equal annual installments over the three-year period from the
applicable grant date, with accelerated vesting terms upon a qualifying termination of employment.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
What happens if I transfer my Company common stock before the special meeting?
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own
Company common stock on the record date and transfer your shares after the record date but prior to
the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of Company common stock at the
special meeting. However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to
whom you transferred your shares of Company common stock.
How do I vote if I am a Company stockholder of record or hold my shares in “street name”?
If you are a Company stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the
special meeting by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the envelope
provided. You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live
webcast.
If your shares of Company common stock are held in a stock brokerage account by a bank, broker or
other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name”, and these
proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee that is considered
the Company stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to
direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares via the internet or by phone if the
bank, broker or other nominee offers these options to you or by completing, dating, signing and
returning a voting instruction form. Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you instructions on
how to submit your voting instructions for your shares of Company common stock. To vote at the
virtual special meeting, which will have the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting
instructions, you will need to register in advance. Please see “The Special Meeting - Registering for
the Special Meeting” beginning on page 32 for information on how to register in advance.
For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures” beginning on page 35.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your
vote is counted. You may still attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you
have already voted by proxy.
What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon. If
you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, the effect will be that the shares of
Company common stock that you own will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
merger agreement proposal.
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the
affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Assuming a
quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or vote at the virtual special
meeting, or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote, it will have no effect on
the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will not be considered votes cast and therefore will have
no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
Yes. For the Company stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and
before the proxy card is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:
you may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier
proxy or voting instructions) in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting Procedures”; or
you may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company’s Secretary at Atlas Air Worldwide
Holdings, Inc., 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577; or
you may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the
virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.
Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of
revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of
revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name”, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through
your broker, bank or other nominee and in accordance with its procedures. If your broker, bank or
other nominee allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by telephone, you may be able to
change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or by mail). To vote at the
virtual special meeting, which will have the same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting
instructions, you will need to register in advance. Please see “The Special Meeting - Registering for
the Special Meeting” beginning on page 32 for information on how to register in advance.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement or multiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your Company
common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
for each brokerage account in which you hold Company common stock. Please submit each proxy
and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your shares of Company
common stock are voted.
If I hold my Company common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock
certificates now?
No. Parent will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent for the payment of the merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement.
At or prior to the effective time, Parent will cause to be deposited with the paying agent an amount in
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. Promptly after the effective time, and in any
event not later than the third business day after the effective time, the surviving corporation will cause
the paying agent to mail to each holder of Company common stock, who holds share certificates or
book-entry shares not held through the Depository Trust Corporation (“DTC”), entitled to the merger
consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such Company stockholder how to
surrender its Company common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of
Company common stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration upon, in the case of
holders of share certificates, the surrender of such certificates for cancelation to the paying agent or,

in the case of holders of non-certificated book-entry shares not held through the DTC, the transfer of
such book-entry shares by book receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form by the paying
agent, and, in each case, together with the associated letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the paying agent. You should not return your stock certificates with the
enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a
letter of transmittal. If you hold non-certificated book-entry shares of Company common stock through
the DTC, you will not be required to deliver a stock certificate or letter of transmittal, and you will
instead receive your cash payment after the paying agent receives the documents requested in the
applicable instruction from the DTC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Payment for Stock”.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for
my Company common stock?
Yes. Holders of Company common stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL so long as they take certain actions and meet certain conditions, including that they do not
vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal. For more information regarding
appraisal rights, see “The Merger - Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 79. Failure to strictly comply
with Section 262 of the DGCL may result in your waiver of, or inability to exercise, appraisal rights.
When is the merger expected to be consummated?
We currently expect to consummate the merger during the fourth quarter of 2022 or first quarter of
2023, subject to receipt of the Company stockholder approval and the required regulatory approvals
and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.
What effect will the merger have on the Company?
If the merger is consummated, MergerCo will be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is consummated,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company common stock to be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the common stock will no longer
be publicly traded.
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not
consummated for any other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their
shares of Company common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain
an independent public company, the Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
NASDAQ, the Company common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the
Company stockholders will continue to own their shares of Company common stock and will continue
to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to
ownership of the Company common stock.
Under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to
$97.5 million and, under certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a

termination fee equal to $227.4 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees”.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the
delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more of the
Company stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to
those Company stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”,
potentially means extra convenience for Company stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Banks, brokers or other nominees with account holders who are Company stockholders may be
“householding” proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple Company
stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected
Company stockholders. If you have received notice from your bank, broker or other nominee that they
will be “householding” communications to your address, such “householding” will continue until you
are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to
participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify
your bank, broker or other nominee and write or call us at the following address or phone number:
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Attention: Office of the Secretary, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings,
Inc., 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577, ((914) 701-8000). Company stockholders who
currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request
“householding” of their communications should contact their banks, brokers or other nominees. We
will promptly deliver an additional copy of the proxy statement to any stockholder who so requests.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-
LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor
provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
and includes this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Those
statements are based on management’s beliefs, plans, expectations and assumptions, and on
information currently available to management. Generally, the words “will”, “may”, “should”, “could”,
“would”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “continue”, “believe”, “seek”, “project”, “estimate”, and
similar expressions used in this proxy statement that do not relate to historical facts are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements
regarding the proposed merger and related matters; the expected timetable for completing the proposed
merger; prospective performance and opportunities; general business outlook; filings and approvals
relating to the transactions; the ability to complete the transactions considering the various closing
conditions; and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.
Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date as of this proxy statement. They are and will
be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to the operations and
business environments of the Company that may cause the actual results of the Company or its
subsidiaries to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, in such forward-looking
statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, the following: (i) the risk that the merger may not be completed in a timely manner
or at all; (ii) the failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals of the merger by
Company stockholders; (iii) the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of
the merger may not be satisfied or waived, including the failure to receive any required regulatory
approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed
on such approvals); (iv) the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for the Company will
be made; (v) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the
termination of the merger agreement relating to the merger, including in circumstances which would
require the Company to pay a termination fee; (vi) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the
merger on the Company’s ability to attract, motivate or retain key executives, pilots and associates, its
ability to maintain relationships with its customers, including Amazon.com, Inc., vendors, service

Approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal
The approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the
holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon. Under
Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the
consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote
not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder’s
behalf) and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement
proposal.
Approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal
The approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at
the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a
Company stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory
compensation proposal.
The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the
merger agreement proposal. Because the vote on the advisory compensation proposal is advisory only, it
will not be binding on the Company, the Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because
the Company is contractually obligated to pay the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger, if the merger is approved
by our stockholders, such compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory compensation proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority
of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special
meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company
stockholder’s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger agreement proposal is approved
at the special meeting.

THE SPECIAL MEETING
The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger
agreement proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to
approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.
Approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal is not a condition to the
consummation of the merger.
A broker “non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner
does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with
respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, but does have
discretionary voting power over other “routine” items and submits votes for those matters. The Company
does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks,
brokers and other nominees only provide banks, brokers and other nominees with discretionary authority
to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
special meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be
permitted to vote your shares of Company common stock at the special meeting without receiving
instructions.",43,44

Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting and regardless of the number of shares of
Company common stock you own, your careful consideration of, and vote on, the merger agreement is
important and we encourage you to vote promptly.
If you are a record holder of Company common stock (in other words, you held Company common
stock in your own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare) and to
ensure that your shares of Company common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that
you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the virtual special meeting. In
order to vote by proxy card, please complete, sign, date and mail the enclosed proxy card in the envelope
provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 28, 2022. You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and voting during the live
webcast.
If you hold your shares in “street name”  (in other words, your Company common stock is held in the
name of your bank, broker or other nominee), you should have received a proxy card and voting
instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from the Company. In order to
vote, complete and mail the proxy card received from your broker, bank or other nominee to ensure that
your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over the internet as instructed by your
broker. To vote at the virtual special meeting, which will have the same effect as revoking any previously
submitted voting instructions, you will need to register in advance. Please see “- Registering for the
Special Meeting” above for information on how to register in advance. Without following the voting
and/or registration instructions, your common stock held in “street name” will not be voted,
which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal and will
not have any effect on the advisory compensation proposal and adjournment proposal.

To comply with restrictions imposed by federal aviation law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, the
Company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws restrict foreign ownership of shares of its Company
common stock. The restrictions imposed by federal aviation law (49 U.S.C. §411 02) currently include a
requirement that no more than 25% of the Company’s voting stock be owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by persons who are not “Citizens of the United States”. There is a separate requirement that the
Company be under the actual control of Citizens of the United States.
Pursuant to the Company’s by-laws, there is a separate stock record, designated the “Foreign Stock
Record” for the registration of Voting Stock that is Beneficially Owned by aliens. “Voting Stock” means all
outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock that the Company may issue from time to time which,
by their terms, may vote. “Beneficially Owned” refers to owners of the Company’s securities who, directly
or indirectly, have or share voting power and/or investment power.
At no time will ownership of shares of Company common stock representing more than the Maximum
Percentage be registered in the Foreign Stock Record. “Maximum Percentage” refers to the maximum
percentage of voting power of Voting Stock which may be voted by, or at the direction of, aliens without
violating applicable statutory, regulatory or interpretative restrictions or adversely affecting the operating
certificates or authorities, in each case, of the Company, Atlas Air, Inc. or Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc.
If the Company finds that the combined voting power of Voting Stock then registered in the Foreign Stock
Record exceeds the Maximum Percentage, the registration of such shares will be removed from the
Foreign Stock Record sufficient to reduce the combined voting power of the shares so registered to an
amount not in excess of the Maximum Percentage.
The enclosed proxy card contains a certification that by signing the proxy card the Company
stockholder certifies that such stockholder is a “Citizen of the United States” as defined by 49
U.S.C. §40102(a)(15) or that the shares represented by the proxy card have been registered on

described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their
shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Company common
stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger
consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are
known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger
consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement.
They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company

considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company

agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to
comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal,
loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions
of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and
financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (i) continuously holds
such shares through the effective time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the merger
or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under
Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in
the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder
of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such
beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and
correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger - Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the
fair value of his, her or its shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the consummation of the merger. As required by those rules, the Company is asking
holders of Company common stock to vote on the approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled
“Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers”, including the associated narrative discussion, and the
agreements, arrangements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or

separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve such compensation and vice versa.
Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board; as the
Company is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, such compensation will be paid or

As part of their ongoing review of the Company’s business, in concert with financial and legal advisors, the
Board and the Company’s senior management team periodically review and evaluate the Company’s
business and long-term strategy, competitive position, historical performance, future prospects and
opportunities to increase stockholder value. These reviews have included discussions as to whether the
Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone company, consider alternative
capital allocation approaches, pursue various acquisitions or pursue a sale of the Company. As part of
these reviews, the Board, together with Company management and with the assistance of the Company’s
advisors, has considered from time to time potential alternatives to enhance stockholder value along with
the potential benefits and risks of any potential alternative.
On June 1, 2021, the Company received an unsolicited letter from Hill City, JFLCO and Apollo
(collectively, the “Consortium”), which included a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash
consideration of $83.50 per share, subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation,
execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by
the Board and the Consortium’s investment committees, approval of the transaction by Company
stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory and other third-party approvals (the “June 1 Offer”). The
June 1 Offer represented a 11.4% premium to the Company common stock’s closing share price of
$74.93 on May 28, 2021, the most recent trading day prior to the June 1 Offer.
On June 3, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley, the Company’s financial advisor, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (“Cravath”), the
Company’s legal advisor, in attendance, to evaluate the June 1 Offer. Representatives of Cravath reviewed
with the Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale
transaction. The Board determined at the meeting that Timothy Bernlohr, a director who had disclosed to
the Board that he had a family connection to a principal of a member of the Consortium, could participate
in discussions regarding strategic alternatives to the June 1 Offer but would recuse himself from
discussions related to the Consortium and the June 1 Offer at the meeting and at subsequent Board
meetings. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the key financial metrics underlying
the June 1 Offer, the Company’s historical stock price performance and a preliminary illustrative financial
analysis of the Company, and Company management provided perspectives on the Company’s recent
performance and outlook. Following discussion, the Board directed that Company management reject the
June 1 Offer on the basis that it did not present sufficient value to Company stockholders.

On June 4, 2021, as required by the terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated
as of March 27, 2019, by and between the Company and Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) (the “Amazon
Stockholders Agreement”), the Company sent a notice to Amazon stating that the Company had received
an acquisition proposal.
On June 7, 2021, the Company sent a letter to the Consortium rejecting the June 1 Offer and stating that
the June 1 Offer was not at a value that the Board believed provided a basis for discussion with the
Consortium regarding a potential transaction.
On February 25, 2022, John Dietrich, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, had a telephone call with
Chip Frazier, Portfolio Manager at Hill City, at Mr. Frazier’s initiation. On the call, Mr. Frazier indicated
that the Consortium remained interested in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. Mr. Dietrich
indicated that while the Company was not currently looking to pursue a sale, the Company was always
open to considering how best to maximize stockholder value. Mr. Dietrich requested that the Company’s
Chief Financial Officer, Spencer Schwartz, be present for further discussion on this topic. Later in the
same day, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz had a follow-up call with Mr. Frazier. Mr. Frazier shared his
perspectives regarding the Company’s stock price performance and the drivers behind public investors’
valuations of the Company. Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz indicated that they would be in touch with Mr.
Frazier the following week after discussing with the Board Mr. Frazier’s outreach.
On February 28, 2022, representatives from Morgan Stanley received an unsolicited phone call from a
representative of Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”), the Consortium’s financial advisor. The representative
from Evercore indicated that the Consortium remained interested in pursuing an acquisition of the
Company and intended to deliver a written acquisition proposal to the Board in the coming days.
On March 2, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss, among other items, the recent unsolicited
approach by the Consortium and potential responses to the approach. The Board determined at the
meeting that Mr. Dietrich should convey to the Consortium that the Company was not looking to pursue a
sale, but that any formal acquisition proposal submitted by the Consortium would be reviewed by the
Board, and that the Board would not be likely to find any proposal of interest unless it presented
compelling stockholder value and a substantial premium to the Company’s then all-time high closing
share price of $95.78, reached on January 4, 2022.
Following the meeting of the Board on March 2, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz called Mr. Frazier to
convey the Board’s message.
Later on March 2, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a
non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $98.00 per share, subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory
definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium’s investment
committees, approval of the transaction by Company stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory
and other third-party approvals (the “March 2 Offer”). The March 2 Offer represented a 21.2% premium to
the Company common stock’s closing share price of $80.84 on March 2, 2022, and a 2.3% premium to
its then all-time high closing share price of $95.78.
On March 4, 2022, pursuant to the Amazon Stockholders Agreement, the Company sent notice to
Amazon of its receipt of an acquisition proposal.

On March 14 and 15, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting. On March 15, with
Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, the Board
discussed, among other items, the March 2 Offer. Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board’s
fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the March 2 Offer. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley also discussed the cyclical nature of the business and risks associated with an evolving
macroeconomic environment, including rising inflation, supply chain challenges and geopolitical instability,
along with historical trends in the Company’s business and how the Company common stock had traded
relative to the Company’s peers in the freight industry. Company management then discussed with the
Board management’s strategic plan, including the Base Management Case (as defined in “- Certain
Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 62), key assumptions underlying the management strategic plan
and key drivers of potential opportunities and risks going forward. Representatives from Morgan Stanley
also presented certain preliminary financial analyses of the Company based on the Base Management
Case. Following discussion, the Board determined that Mr. Dietrich should convey to the Consortium: that
the Board was not looking to pursue a sale of the Company, but is always open to considering what may
be in the best interests of Company stockholders; that the Board had carefully considered the March 2
Offer and determined that it was not at a high enough value for the Company to engage with the
Consortium regarding a potential transaction; and that any proposal would have to be at a substantial
premium to the Company’s recent all-time high stock price of $95.78 to provide a basis for further
engagement.
On March 18, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz had a call with Mr. Frazier, during which Mr. Dietrich
communicated the Board’s message and determinations, including that the Board had rejected the March
2 Offer.
On March 23, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a non-
binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $107.00 per share, subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory
definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium’s investment
committees, approval of the transaction by Company stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory
and other third-party approvals (the “March 23 Offer”). The March 23 Offer represented a 23.6% premium
to the Company common stock’s closing share price of $86.60 on March 23, 2022 and a 11.7% premium
to its then all-time high closing share price of $95.78.
On March 25, 2022, pursuant to the Amazon Stockholders Agreement, the Company sent notice to
Amazon of its receipt of an acquisition proposal.
On March 29, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz called Mr. Frazier to inform him that the March 23 Offer
was under review by the Board and Company management.
On March 30, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss the March 23 Offer. At the
meeting, representatives from Cravath reviewed with the Board their fiduciary duties and other legal
matters in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction. Representatives from Morgan Stanley
reviewed with the Board the March 23 Offer, including how the March 23 Offer compared to the prior offers
received from the Consortium. The Board discussed with Company management and the representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Cravath various potential ways in which the Company could respond to the March
23 Offer. Following discussion, the Board determined that Mr. Dietrich should inform the Consortium that
the Board was not willing to consummate a transaction at the price proposed in the

March 23 Offer, but that the Board was willing to allow the Consortium to conduct limited due diligence to
see if it would be prepared to offer increased value, subject to the Consortium’s agreement to a customary
confidentiality agreement (the “Consortium NDA”).
On April 1, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz had a call with Mr. Frazier, during which Mr. Dietrich
communicated the Board’s message and determinations to Mr. Frazier and the parties discussed next
steps regarding due diligence and the proposed entry into the Consortium NDA.
On April 4, 2022, representatives of the Company provided the Consortium with a draft of the Consortium
NDA. Between April 4 and April 12, the parties exchanged drafts of and negotiated the Consortium NDA.
On April 8, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. At the meeting, among other things, the Board reviewed the
materials that Company management prepared for a management presentation, including the Seller Case
(as defined in “- Certain Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 62), to be delivered to the Consortium at
a meeting scheduled for April 12, 2022. The Board also discussed the differences between the Seller
Case and the Base Management Case (as described further in “- Certain Financial Forecasts” beginning
on page 62).
On April 12, 2022, the Company and funds affiliated with the members of the Consortium executed the
Consortium NDA, which did not contain a “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision and contained standstill
provisions that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition
agreement with a third party.
Later on April 12, 2022, representatives of the Company, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in
attendance, held a management presentation for, and provided the Seller Case to, representatives of the
Consortium and Evercore.
Between April 12 and late May 2022, the Company provided due diligence materials to the Consortium,
including through a virtual data room containing initial due diligence materials, and representatives of
Company management and Morgan Stanley had numerous calls with representatives of the Consortium
and Evercore regarding due diligence.
On May 3, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. Company management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed with the Board the March 23 Offer, as well as the prior offers submitted by the
Consortium. The Board discussed with its advisors trends in the U.S. equity and debt markets, and how
the Company’s stock price, and the stock prices of its peers in the freight sector, had decreased since
the March 23 Offer was submitted. After discussing various alternative approaches to continuing
engagement with the Consortium, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company
and Company stockholders to continue facilitating the Consortium’s due diligence and to encourage the
Consortium to submit an updated proposal after the Company’s earnings call for the first quarter of 2022,
scheduled for May 5, 2022.
On May 6, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of Evercore to request that
the Consortium submit a revised acquisition proposal representing its best offer.
On May 12, 2022, with the Company’s permission and to facilitate the Consortium’s transaction analysis
and to avoid the risk of leaks, the Consortium had a discussion with a leveraged finance team at Morgan

Stanley regarding the condition of the financing markets, with the understanding that Morgan Stanley and
its affiliates would not provide financing to the Consortium or any other potential buyers in a potential
strategic transaction with the Company.
On May 19, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a
reaffirmed, non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $107.00 per share,
subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually
satisfactory definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium’s
investment committees, approval of the transaction by the Company stockholders and receipt of
customary regulatory and other third-party approvals (the “May 19 Offer”). As of the May 19 Offer, the U.S.
equity and debt markets had experienced significant downturns since the Consortium had sent its letter
containing the March 23 Offer. These downturns coincided with a period of rising interest rates and oil
prices, increased inflation and geopolitical instability, resulting in a general decline in the stock prices of
the Company and its industry peers in the freight sector relative to earlier periods in the year. In its letter,
the Consortium noted that since the March 23 Offer had been communicated, macroeconomic conditions
had changed, and that the May 19 Offer, which maintained the $107.00 per share price despite such
headwinds, represented a significant increase in the premium offered per share as compared to the March
23 Offer. The May 19 Offer represented a 54.8% premium to the Company common stock’s closing share
price of $69.10 on May 18, 2022, and an 11.7% premium to its then all-time high closing share price of
$95.78.
On May 24, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided to the Company a disclosure statement identifying prior and
current engagements and relationships between Morgan Stanley and affiliates of members of the
Consortium.
Later on May 24, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss, among other items, the May 19
Offer. Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the May 19
Offer, along with current industry and macroeconomic trends, highlighting the deteriorating market
conditions due to strong inflation, rising oil prices and the conflict in Ukraine, which was resulting in higher
costs of capital in the U.S. debt and equity markets. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board
its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction. The
Board discussed with Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath
potentially initiating an exploratory process involving outreach to additional potential counterparties to a
strategic transaction. In an executive session attended by only the Board, Company management and the
representatives of Cravath, the Board concluded, following discussion, that Mr. Dietrich and Company
management, together with the Company’s advisors, should (i) continue to advance more fulsome due
diligence with the Consortium, while continuing to seek to obtain a higher price from the Consortium, and
(ii) begin a process of soliciting proposals from a group of other potential acquirors, and to compare those
proposals with that received from the Consortium and the Company’s standalone outlook. The Board then
directed Company management to begin outreach to a list of potential strategic and financial
counterparties identified during the meeting.
On May 25, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley called representatives of Evercore to convey that,
while the Board was disappointed that the May 19 Offer had not improved in absolute terms upon the
March 23 Offer, the Company intended to continue working with the Consortium toward a potential
transaction, including by providing access to a virtual data room containing additional due diligence
materials. The representatives of Morgan Stanley emphasized that the Board and Company management
continued to believe that a higher price was appropriate.

Between May 27 and June 7, 2022, the Company and its advisors negotiated and executed confidentiality

Evercore, regarding due diligence. Also throughout this period, the Board received periodic updates from
Company management and the Company’s financial and legal advisors.
On June 9, 2022, representatives of the Company and Morgan Stanley called representatives of each of
Party C, Party E, Party F and Party I and requested that the parties each submit an initial acquisition

also offered each prospective bidder the opportunity to speak with a leveraged finance team at Morgan
Stanley to discuss the condition of the financing market, with the understanding that Morgan Stanley
would not provide financing to any of the potential buyers in a potential strategic transaction with the

Party H each noting that an acquisition of the Company did not align with its current strategic direction.
On June 13, 2022, a telephonic meeting was held, with Duncan McNabb, the Chairman of the Board, Mr.
Dietrich, and the Company’s three newest directors, Messrs. Borst, Conner and Willis, as well as certain
members of Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, for
the purpose of providing the new directors with an overview of the Company’s ongoing exploratory process
of soliciting proposals from potential acquirors and the acquisition proposals received to date from the
Consortium, including by having the representatives of Morgan Stanley review with the directors certain
preliminary financial analyses previously presented to the Board.
On June 15 and June 16, 2022, Party F and Party C, respectively, informed representatives of Morgan
Stanley that neither would be submitting an acquisition proposal. Party F noted that the opportunity was
not the right fit for its company. Party C noted that it did not believe it would be able to offer a competitive
valuation.
Also on June 16, 2022, Party E delivered a letter to the Company that included a non-binding offer to
acquire the Company for cash consideration of $100.00 per share, subject to satisfactory completion of
due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement, and approval of the definitive agreement by Party
E’s investment committee (the “Party E Offer”). The letter stated that the Party E Offer was not contingent
on securing any third-party equity capital commitments, and that Party E expected to fund a component
of the purchase price with third-party debt.
Also on June 16, 2022, Party I delivered a letter to the Company that included a non-binding offer to
acquire the Company for cash consideration within the range of $95.00 to $110.00 per share, subject to
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement, and formal approval of
the definitive agreement by Party I’s investment committee (the “Party I Offer”). The letter indicated that
the price per share was presented as a range due to Party I not having completed due diligence into the
Company’s contracts and not having finalized the terms of its proposed financing. The letter also
expressed skepticism that Party I would be able to obtain the debt financing it required on terms it would
find acceptable.
On June 16 and June 17, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley held calls with representatives of each
of Party E and Party I to discuss the Party E Offer and Party I Offer, respectively, including the factors
driving the valuation implied by the applicable offer. The representatives of Party E indicated to Morgan
Stanley that the $100.00 per share valuation included in the Party E Offer assumed a fully favorable due
diligence investigation based on forecasts presented by Company management and Party E’s ability to
obtain acceptable financing terms. The representatives of Party I indicated that the range included in the
Party I Offer was contingent upon gaining greater visibility into the Company’s contracted business,
improvement in the conditions in the financing markets and its ability to obtain acceptable financing
terms, and that each of these components would need to turn out favorably to justify a price at the high
end of such range.
On June 18, 2022, following receipt of the Party E Offer and the Party I Offer, pursuant to the Amazon
Stockholders Agreement, the Company sent notice to Amazon of its receipt of two acquisition proposals.

On June 21, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss, among other items, updates related to the
ongoing bidding process, including the Party E Offer and the Party I Offer, and corresponding next steps.
Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the
context of a review of a potential sale transaction. Company management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley provided an update on the ongoing engagement with the Consortium, and representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the Party E Offer and the Party I Offer. Following discussion, the
Board directed Company management and the Company’s advisors to: (i) invite Party E and Party I to
engage with the Company on a timeline to announce any proposed transaction before the Company’s
second quarter earnings release in early August, with a final bid deadline of July 26, 2022, (ii) provide
Party E and Party I with the same due diligence information made available to the Consortium, (iii) deliver
a draft merger agreement to each of Party E, Party I and the Consortium, (iv) communicate to the
Consortium the proposed transaction timeline and July 26 final bid deadline and (v) inform the Consortium
about the existence of other prospective bidders.
Later on June 21, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of each of the
Consortium, Party E and Party I to communicate the proposed transaction timing and July 26 final bid
deadline, and to discuss providing each party with access to expanded due diligence information.
On June 22, 2022, Party E and Party I were each granted access to a virtual data room containing the
Seller Case and other due diligence materials that had been made available to the Consortium.
On June 23, 2022, at the request of directors of the Company, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to
representatives of a strategic party we refer to as “Party J” to determine if such party would be interested
in a potential strategic transaction with the Company. On June 28, 2022, Party J informed representatives
of Morgan Stanley that it was not interested in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company at that
time as the opportunity did not align with its current strategic direction.
Also on June 28, 2022, Party E informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party E was unlikely to
increase its offer above $100 per share based on the work it had done to date.
On June 29, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. The Board discussed with its advisors the ongoing diligence
processes conducted by the Consortium, Party E and Party I, as well as the draft merger agreement that
was proposed to be provided to each prospective bidder. The Board also approved the terms of the
proposed form of engagement letter providing for Morgan Stanley’s engagement as the Company’s
financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of the Company, which was executed by Company
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley on June 30, 2022.
Also on June 29, 2022, a draft of the merger agreement prepared by Cravath was provided to
representatives of the Consortium, Party E and Party I. This draft of the merger agreement provided for,
among other things: a “go-shop” period of 30 days (with an extension period of up to 15 days); a
termination fee payable by the Company of (i) 0.75% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company in the
event the merger agreement was terminated for the Company to enter into a superior proposal received
during the go-shop period and (ii) 1.5% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company otherwise; a
reverse termination fee payable by the prospective buyer of 10% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company; and a “fiduciary out” provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation that Company
stockholders approve the merger agreement either upon receipt of a superior takeover

proposal or if the failure to change such recommendation is inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law.
On July 1, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted each of the Consortium, Party E and Party
I to request a markup of the draft merger agreement by July 18, 2022, and to confirm the request for a final
acquisition proposal by July 26, 2022.
On July 6, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley informed Antoine Munfakh, as a representative of the
Consortium, that the Company had engaged with other prospective bidders that were exploring a potential
transaction with the Company in parallel to the Consortium. Mr. Munfakh had previously requested a
meeting with Mr. Dietrich to discuss the Company and its prospects. That meeting was scheduled for July
11, 2022.
Between early June and late July 2022, the Company provided its consent to the Consortium to engage in
conversations with various debt financing sources to discuss financing terms.
On July 11, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Munfakh met for lunch. Mr. Munfakh affirmed the Consortium’s
continued interest in acquiring the Company, and noted that significant resources had been devoted to the
potential transaction and to advancing due diligence. Mr. Munfakh noted, however, that the Consortium’s
most significant challenge was obtaining acceptable financing terms. Mr. Dietrich answered questions
that Mr. Munfakh had asked regarding the Company’s business and discussed certain of the Company’s
business opportunities. Mr. Munfakh and Mr. Dietrich also discussed the timeline for the bidding process,
and Mr. Munfakh indicated he expected the Consortium would be able to submit a draft merger agreement
mark-up and final proposal on the timeline provided by the Company.
On July 13, 2022, representatives of Party I informed Morgan Stanley that Party I would not submit a final
proposal to acquire the Company, citing that Party I had been unable to secure financing on acceptable
terms given the current condition of the financing markets, and that it had been unable to substantiate
value anywhere near the top end of the range provided in the Party I Offer. The representatives of Party I
inquired as to whether the Company would be willing to delay its timeline for entering into a potential
transaction to allow the conditions of the financing market to improve, but the representatives of Morgan
Stanley responded, on behalf of the Board, that the Company was seeking to conclude the process prior
to its earnings release for the second quarter of 2022, scheduled for early August.
On July 18, 2022, representatives of Party E had informed Morgan Stanley that Party E would not submit
a final proposal to acquire the Company, citing the condition of the financing markets and that it was
unable to substantiate additional value beyond the $100.00 per share amount set forth in the Party E
Offer.
Also on July 18, 2022, the Company issued a press release setting August 5, 2022 as the date of its
earnings call for the second quarter of 2022.
On July 19, 2022, representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), the
Consortium’s legal advisor, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Cravath on
behalf of the Consortium. This draft of the merger agreement reduced the proposed “go-shop” extension
period down to five days and also bracketed the go-shop provision as under consideration by the
Consortium; it proposed a Company termination fee of 3.5% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company following the go-shop period; it proposed a reverse termination fee of 5% of the fully diluted
equity value of the Company; it provided that the Company was to reimburse the Consortium’s transaction

expenses up to an undetermined value if the deal was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain
stockholder approval; it provided that the Company would use commercially reasonable efforts to have no
less than $700 million in cash and cash equivalents at the closing of the merger; and it revised the
“fiduciary out” provision to require that the Company only change its recommendation to Company
stockholders with respect to approval of the merger agreement in the event of a conflict with its fiduciary
duties upon the occurrence of a material event or development that was neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Board prior to the date of the merger agreement, and which is not related to a takeover
proposal.
On July 20, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives
of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board its
fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Company management updated the Board on Party E’s and Party
I’s withdrawal from the bidding process, noting that Party I in particular had cited the conditions of the
financing market and its inability to obtain acceptable financing terms in its decision to withdraw. The
Board determined that it would continue to engage with the Consortium in advance of receipt of its final
acquisition proposal the following week.
On July 22, 2022, Company management held a call with representatives of the Consortium to discuss
the Company’s results for the second quarter of 2022, scheduled to be announced on August 5, 2022, and
the updated forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022, which information was also provided to the
Consortium as part of its due diligence.
On July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath held a call with representatives of Paul Weiss to discuss the
revised draft of the merger agreement received from Paul Weiss on July 19, 2022.
Later on July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Paul Weiss on behalf of the Company. This version of the merger agreement increased
the go-shop extension period to 15 days; it proposed a Company termination fee of 1.5% of the fully
diluted equity value of the Company following the go-shop extension period; it proposed a reverse
termination fee of 10% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company; it removed the Company’s
obligation to reimburse the Consortium’s transaction expenses up to an undetermined value if the deal
was terminated due to the Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval; and it removed the provision
requiring the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to have no less than $700 million in cash
and cash equivalents at the closing of the merger.
From July 22 until the execution of the merger agreement on August 4, 2022, representatives of Cravath
and other legal advisors to the Company (including Hogan Lovells, as regulatory legal counsel to the
Company (“Hogan Lovells”), and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, as aircraft legal counsel to the
Company) had calls and exchanged correspondence with Paul Weiss and other legal advisors to the
Consortium (including KMA Zuckert LLC, as regulatory legal counsel to the Consortium) related to the
draft merger agreement and other related draft transaction documentation.
On July 26, 2022, representatives of the Consortium informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that they
would not be able to submit a final bid that day, as had been requested by the Company, as they required
additional time to finalize the details of the Consortium’s financing package. The Consortium indicated,
however, that it expected to submit a final bid later in the week.

THE MERGER
Between July 26 and July 28, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of the
Consortium to communicate the importance of the Consortium providing a bid prior to the Board meeting
scheduled for the morning of July 29, 2022.
On the morning of July 29, 2022, representatives of the Consortium delivered to the Board a letter which
included a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $101.00 per share,
subject to the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements, approval
of the transaction by Company stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory and other third-party
approvals (the “July 29 Offer”). The Consortium further noted in its letter that it had completed its due
diligence. In advance of delivering the letter, Mr. Munfakh called Mr. Dietrich to preview the updated bid
and explained the decreased bid price relative to the Consortium’s prior bid price was a result of the
Consortium’s increased costs and potential inability to obtain acceptable financing terms to the extent
required to maintain its previously offered price per share, as well as the Company’s actual results for the
second quarter of 2022 and forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022 previously made available to the
Consortium. The July 29 Offer represented a 38.0% premium to the Company common stock’s closing
share price of $73.19 on July 28, 2022, and a 5.4% premium to its then all-time high closing share price of
$95.78.
Also in the morning on July 29, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss sent a revised draft of the merger
agreement to representatives of Cravath on behalf of the Consortium. This draft of the merger agreement
reduced the proposed go-shop extension period down to five days and bracketed the go-shop period as
under consideration by the Consortium; it increased the Company termination fee to 3.5% of the fully
diluted equity value of the Company following the go-shop period; it decreased the reverse termination fee
of 5% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company; and it provided that the Company was to reimburse
the Consortium’s transaction expenses up to an undetermined value if the deal was terminated due to the
Company’s failure to obtain stockholder approval.
Later in the morning of July 29, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company
management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. Members of Company
management summarized negotiations with the Consortium to date and explained to the Board that the
Consortium had cited the absorption of increased costs, the difficulties in obtaining acceptable financing
terms, the broader macroeconomic climate and the Company’s actual results for the second quarter of
2022 and forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022 previously made available to the Consortium as the
predominant factors driving a bid that was lower than the March 23 Offer and the May 19 Offer.
Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the
context of a review of a potential sale transaction, and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed for the
Board the terms of the July 29 Offer and presented an updated financial analysis to account for the current
state of the financing market and the Company’s performance since the March 23 Offer and the May 19
Offer. Members of the Company management presented to the Board the Updated Management Case (as
defined in “- Certain Financial Forecasts”). The Company’s management also discussed their views on the
outlook for the Company’s business on a standalone basis. Following discussion, the Board directed that
Mr. Dietrich send the Consortium a counteroffer of $105.00 per share, provided that the Consortium
respond as soon as possible and that the Consortium finalize its financing commitments by August 2,
2022.
Later in the day on July 29, 2022, Mr. Dietrich talked to Mr. Munfakh on the phone and communicated the
Board’s counteroffer of $105.00 per share and the Board’s other messages.
On July 30, 2022, Mr. Munfakh called Mr. Dietrich to provide a counteroffer of $102.50 per share (the “July
30 Offer”), which he confirmed was the highest bid the Consortium would be willing to offer.

Later in the day on July 30, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. Mr. Dietrich provided the Board with a
summary of his conversation with Mr. Munfakh. After discussion and careful deliberation, the Board
authorized Company management and the Company’s advisors to move forward with the Consortium’s
proposed acquisition price of $102.50 per share in cash, provided that all remaining deal points and
documentation could be negotiated with the Consortium and finalized on terms acceptable to the
Company prior to the Company’s scheduled earnings announcement date of August 5, 2022.
Later on July 30, 2022, Mr. Dietrich called Mr. Munfakh and communicated the Board’s willingness to
move forward with an acquisition at $102.50 per share and agreed to remove the go-shop provision from
the merger agreement in exchange for the Consortium’s agreement to certain terms in the merger
agreement, including, among other items, (i) a reverse termination fee of 8% of the fully diluted equity
value of the Company and (ii) a Company termination fee of 3% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company.
On July 31, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Munfakh agreed that the merger agreement would not include a go-
shop provision; would include a Company termination fee of 3% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company; and would include a reverse termination fee of 7% of the fully diluted equity value of the
Company.
Between July 29, 2022 and August 3, 2022, the Company and its advisors continued to negotiate with the

On the evening of August 2, 2022, Bloomberg published an article stating that an investor group led by

agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the following non-exhaustive list of

the Board’s understanding of the risks and uncertainties in the industry in which the Company
competes, and the risks that the Company would face if it continued to operate on a stand-alone
public company basis, including:
risks relating to the air cargo services industry, including, but not limited to, the competitive market
for air cargo services, the failure to comply with extensive governmental laws and regulations in the
U.S. and abroad and the imposition of more stringent regulations and rules on the air cargo
services industry, and the initiatives to address global climate change;

risks relating to the Company’s agreements with Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Fulfillment
Services, Inc. (collectively, “Amazon parties”), including that the Amazon parties may exercise
their termination rights under certain agreements with the Company, which may result in the
Company’s inability to realize the full benefits of the agreements, the Amazon parties may
exercise their right to acquire additional shares of Company common stock pursuant to the
warrants granted to the Amazon parties which may, amongst other things, entitle the Amazon
parties to appoint a director to the Board, dilute the current ownership interests and adversely
affect the market price of Company common stock;
risks that revenues from the AMC, which accounted for total operating revenue of approximately
10.5% in 2021, 15.9% in 2020 and 24.6% in 2019, may decline over time and that teaming
arrangements may affect the Company’s relative share of AMC flying and the associated revenue;
risks relating to the Company’s dry leasing business, including the risk of failure to realize the
anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Company’s dry leasing joint venture with Bain
Capital Credit, LP and the risk of default by the Company’s dry lease customers, including, but not
limited to, the failure to make timely payments, the failure to maintain insurance and the failure to
properly maintain the Company’s aircraft;

ability to raise additional capital to fund its aircraft purchases, operations or other capital
requirements; and
other risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022;
the Board’s assessment of potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with remaining an
independent public company as a possible strategic alternative to the sale of the entire Company
(including the potential value to Company stockholders based on the Company’s strategic plan that
could be expected to be generated from remaining an independent public company), and the Board’s
resulting determination that such alternative did not represent an attractive alternative to the merger;
the Board’s consideration of the current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty
surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near term and the long term, which could
negatively affect the Company’s financial performance;
the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, which provides certainty, immediate value and
liquidity to holders of Company common stock, especially when viewed against any internal or
external risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s stand-alone strategy, immediately
upon the closing of the merger;
the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board by representatives of Morgan Stanley,

based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in
Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the

common stock, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described below in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “- Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”;

the Board’s assessment, taking into account the other factors described herein, of the Company’s
value on a stand-alone basis relative to the $102.50 per share of Company common stock to be paid
in cash in connection with the merger, and the possibility that the trading price of shares of Company
common stock would not reach and sustain such price, or that doing so could take a considerable
period of time;
the Company’s operating and financial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective
forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company’s senior management, which reflect an
application of various assumptions of senior management, and the inherent uncertainty of achieving
senior management’s prospective forecasts, as set forth below under the section entitled “- Certain
Financial Forecasts”, and that as a result the Company’s actual financial results in future periods
could differ materially from senior management’s forecasts;
the Board’s process for soliciting and responding to offers from the financial and strategic third parties
that were believed to be the most willing and able to pay the highest price for the Company, which
included contacting, or responding to, 11 potential acquirors, entering into non-disclosure agreements
with five potential acquirors, providing management presentations to five potential acquirors, granting
access to a data room containing detailed due diligence materials to three potential acquirors,
receiving non-binding offers from three potential acquirors and receiving one final proposal, which was
from the Consortium, as well as providing Amazon.com, Inc. with an opportunity to make an
acquisition proposal by notifying Amazon.com, Inc. of the Company’s receipt of acquisition proposals
from third parties as required by the terms of the Amazon Stockholders Agreement, and the fact that,
although several of the potential acquirors, including Party E and Party I, had cited the amount of
available financing and the terms available in the current condition of the financing markets as reasons
for withdrawing from the sale process, the Consortium had obtained committed debt and equity
financing for the full amount in cash necessary to fund the aggregate merger consideration, in each
case as further described above under the section entitled “- Background of the Merger”;
the course and history of competitive arm’s-length negotiations with all three third parties that
submitted non-binding offers, which negotiations the Board believed resulted in the Company obtaining
the highest price that the Consortium, as the last remaining bidder, was willing to pay for the
Company, as evidenced by the Company’s ability to increase the Consortium’s proposed price per
share of Company common stock from $83.50 in its June 1, 2021 initial proposal to $102.50 per share
in its July 30, 2022 final offer, as further described above under the section entitled “- Background of
the Merger”;
the Board’s belief that, based on discussions with the Consortium and other potential counterparties,
the final proposal submitted by the Consortium represented the best and final offer and the highest
price per share of Company common stock that the Consortium or any other potential counterparty
would be willing to pay, particularly given the condition of the financing market and broader
macroeconomic climate, and any request for a further price increase or solicitation of additional bids
from other third parties would have created a meaningful risk that the Consortium might determine not
to enter into the transaction and to terminate negotiations, in which event Company stockholders
would lose the opportunity to obtain the proposed $102.50 per share of Company common stock in
cash being offered;

track record that Apollo and JFLCO have developed in acquiring other companies;
the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition, that the Consortium obtained
committed debt financing for the merger from reputable financing sources, and that each of the Apollo

committed debt

financing, to fund the aggregate merger consideration, as further described below in the section
entitled “- Financing of the Merger”;
the fact that if any portion of the debt financing for the merger becomes unavailable, Parent is required
to use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to consummate
the merger;
the fact that the Apollo Guarantors, certain of the JFLCO Funds and the Hill City Fund have provided
certain limited guarantees, which support Parent’s obligation to pay Parent’s termination fee to the
extent payable, in favor of the Company as described below in the section entitled “- Financing of the
Merger”;
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company (i) to seek specific performance of
Parent to perform its obligations under the merger agreement, including to use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain debt financing, and (ii) if the debt financing is available at closing, to force the equity
financing to be funded and to cause the merger to occur;
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, in response to certain unsolicited
takeover proposals, to furnish information to and conduct discussions and negotiations with third
parties prior to the Company stockholder approval under certain circumstances and, under certain
conditions, to accept a superior proposal, and the Company’s corresponding right to terminate the
merger agreement (subject to the payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $97.5 million
and certain rights of Parent to match the superior proposal) in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of such superior proposal;
the provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Board, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of
the merger agreement proposal, to not include, withdraw or modify (or modify, amend or qualify in a
matter adverse to Parent) its recommendation in the proxy statement that our stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement, under certain circumstances relating to a superior proposal or intervening
event, subject to payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $97.5 million if Parent elects to
terminate the merger agreement in such circumstances, and that the amount of the Company
termination fee is comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable,
would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be paid unless the Company
entered into a more favorable transaction;
the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the debt and equity financing documents,
which were reviewed by the Board with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
and the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties;
the high probability that the merger would be consummated based on, among other things, the
absence of a financing contingency and the $227.4 million Parent termination fee, payable to the
Company if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is
guaranteed by the Apollo Guarantors, the JFLCO Funds and the Hill City Fund in accordance with
their maximum caps as described in “- Financing of the Merger - Limited Guarantees”, pursuant to the
limited guarantees delivered by them, the Consortium members’ ability to complete large acquisition
transactions and Apollo’s experience with transactions in the airline industry;
the high probability that the merger would be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly
manner, which could reduce the period during which the Company’s business would be subject to the
potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption;
the fact that resolutions approving the merger were unanimously approved by the Board, which is
comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not affiliated with the Company and are not
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and our stockholders
would be free to reject the merger by voting against the adoption of the merger agreement; and
the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company stockholders who comply with all of the
required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the merger,
including the fact that such stockholders will have the right to demand appraisal and payment of the
fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court, as further described in the section
entitled “- Appraisal Rights”.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing
factors related to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following material factors:
the potential upside in the Company’s stand-alone strategic plan;
the possibility that the merger might not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated
or at all due to a failure of certain conditions, including with respect to the required approval of the
transaction by the required regulatory authorities;
the risks and costs to the Company if the merger does not close in a timely manner or at all,
including:
the trading price of Company common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of the
Company common stock currently reflects positive market assumptions that the merger will be
consummated;
the potential negative impact on the Company’s ability to attract, hire and retain key employees,
as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the
Company following the merger;
the potential disruption to the Company’s business and distraction of its workforce and
management team from day-to-day operations and from pursuing other opportunities that could be
beneficial to the Company, in each case without realizing any of the benefits of having the merger
completed; and
reputational harm to the Company’s relationships with investors, customers, suppliers, business
partners and other third parties due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully
complete the merger.
the fact that holders of Company common stock will have no ongoing equity interest in the surviving
corporation following the merger, meaning that the holders of Company common stock will not (by
virtue of their holding Company common stock) participate in the Company’s potential future earnings
or growth;
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the merger,
which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking certain significant financing transactions
and business opportunities that may arise or any other action that it might otherwise take with respect
to the operations and strategy of the Company, even if such actions would prove beneficial to the
Company;
the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and material delays resulting from seeking
regulatory approvals and other clearances, consents and approvals necessary for consummation of
the merger;
the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the Company’s ability to solicit or participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding alternative takeover proposals with third parties, subject to
specified exceptions, and that require the Company to negotiate with Parent (if Parent desires to
propose revisions to the merger agreement and negotiate) prior to the Company being able to
terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal;

THE MERGER
the possibility that the Company’s obligation to pay the Company termination fee of $97.5 million to
Parent upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage
other potential acquirors from making an alternative proposal to acquire the Company;
the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and consummating
the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and integration costs, and the fact that if the
merger is not consummated, the Company may be required to bear such costs;
the possibility that, although the merger provides the Company stockholders the opportunity to realize
a premium to the price at which Company common stock traded prior to the public announcement of
the merger, the price of Company common stock might have increased in the future to a price greater
than the merger consideration;
the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the consummation
of the merger and the other transactions contemplated therein;
the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the holders of common stock that are U.S.
holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
various other risks associated with the merger and the business of the Company, as more fully
described above in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that the Company’s directors and executive
officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the
Company stockholders generally, as described more fully below in the section entitled “- Interests of the
Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but
rather includes the material factors considered by the Board. The Board unanimously reached the
conclusion to (i) determine and declare that it is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and Company stockholders, that the Company enter into the merger agreement and
consummate the transactions, (ii) approve and declare the advisability of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the transactions, including the merger, (iii) recommend that the Company stockholders
entitled to vote adopt the merger agreement and (iv) direct that the merger agreement be submitted to the
Company’s stockholders entitled to vote for adoption in light of the factors described above and other
factors that the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the
Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did
not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or
unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its recommendation based
on the totality of the information available to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the
Company’s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above,
individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors.
This explanation of the Board’s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this
section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
beginning on page 28.

Other than annual guidance - including the guidance included in the Company’s press release dated
February 17, 2022 and the updates of such guidance in the Company’s press release dated May 5, 2022
(the “2022 earnings guidance”), with respect to revenues, adjusted EBITDA, net income, core capital
expenditures and certain other performance measures, some of which guidance the Company presents as
a range - the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future
performance, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, the Company has included in this proxy statement certain financial forecasts of the
Company that, to the extent described herein, were furnished to (i) the Board, the Company’s financial
advisor and the Consortium, in connection with the discussions concerning the proposed merger and (ii)
certain other parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company.
These Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or
with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the
SEC regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States (“GAAP”). A summary of this information is presented below.
No assurances can be made regarding future events and the estimates and assumptions underlying these
financial forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive,
regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that
are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and
contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic
conditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates, and the risk and uncertainties
described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 28, all
of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company and, upon
consummation of the merger, will be beyond the control of the Consortium and the surviving corporation.
Company stockholders are urged to review the Company’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with
respect to the Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions will
prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized. Actual results likely will differ, and may
differ materially, from those reflected in the Financial Forecasts, whether or not the merger is
consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial Forecasts below should not be
regarded as an indication that the Company, the Consortium, their respective boards of directors (or
equivalent governing bodies) or their respective financial advisors considered, or now consider, these
forecasts to be a reliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they
nor any underlying assumptions should be relied upon as being indicative of future results. Readers of this
proxy statement are cautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial Forecasts assume
that the Company would continue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impact of
the merger, except as described below for the Seller Case.
Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are
not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the
amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement
have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to
investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures in this proxy
statement and the accompanying footnotes may be calculated differently from, and may not be directly
comparable to, similarly titled measures used by the Company’s competitors and other companies, or
any similarly titled measures used by any member of the Consortium or any of their respective affiliates.

THE MERGER
Due to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP
measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below provide
certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
The Financial Forecasts included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,
the Company’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor has not audited,
reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the accompanying
Financial Forecasts and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any
other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by
reference in this document relates to the Company’s previously issued financial statements. It does not
extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts that were approved by the
Company for use by Morgan Stanley (consisting of the Updated Management Case and the Company
Unlevered Free Cash Flow (as defined below)) were relied upon by Morgan Stanley for its financial
analysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its consideration of the
merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in connection with a business combination
transaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures. In
addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board or Morgan
Stanley in connection with their respective evaluations of the merger. Accordingly, the Company has not
provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts to the
relevant GAAP financial measures.
By including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, none of the Company or the
Consortium members or any of their respective representatives has made or makes any representation to
any person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in
the Financial Forecasts. Accordingly, the Financial Forecasts should not be construed as financial
guidance, nor relied upon as such, and the Financial Forecasts may differ in important respects from the
2022 earnings guidance, some of which guidance is presented as a range, and which the Company’s
management prepared based on a different set of assumptions. The inclusion of the Financial Forecasts
in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company that the
information contained therein is material. The Financial Forecasts summarized in this section reflected
the opinions, estimates and judgments of the Company’s management at the time they were prepared
and have not been updated to reflect any changes since such Financial Forecasts were prepared. NONE
OF THE COMPANY, THE CONSORTIUM MEMBERS OR, AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER,
THE SURVIVING CORPORATION, UNDERTAKES ANY OBLIGATION, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW,
TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE FINANCIAL FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES
EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION, CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY
CONDITIONS OR THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY
OR ALL OF THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR.
The Company’s management prepared nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal
years 2022 through 2026 (which we refer to as the “Base Management Case”) for the Company’s internal
use, that was first reviewed by the Board at its meeting held on March 15, 2022. The Base Management
Case was not made available to the Consortium or the other parties potentially interested in a transaction
with the Company.

The Company’s management also prepared a so-called “Seller Case” that was reviewed by the Board at
its meeting held on April 8, 2022 and was also made available to the Consortium and certain other parties
potentially interested in a transaction with the Company in the course of their due diligence and in
connection with their review of a possible transaction with the Company. The Seller Case reflected certain
assumptions with respect to yields, crew costs, crew availability and operating as a private entity.
In addition, in connection with the Company’s evaluation of a proposed transaction in July 2022, the
Company’s management updated the Base Management Case (which we refer to as the “Updated
Management Case”) to reflect (i) the actual results for the second quarter of 2022 and (ii) an updated
forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022 and for fiscal years 2023 through 2026, which updated forecast
took into account certain adjustments relating to, among other things, the developments with respect to
yields, crew costs, crew availability, fuel costs (which generally impact revenue but do not result in
material changes to EBITDAR) and the Company and its subsidiaries entering into new customer
agreements. The Updated Management Case was relied upon by the Board in reaching its determination
on August 3, 2022 to approve and declare advisable the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and to recommend that the Company’s shareholders vote to adopt the merger
agreement, and was the only forecast prepared by management that was approved by the Company for
use by Morgan Stanley in connection with rendering its oral opinion delivered to the Board, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of August 3, 2022, and performing its
financial analysis in connection therewith, as summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-",71,75

Morgan Stanley was retained by the Company to act as its financial advisor and to render a financial
opinion in connection with a potential sale of the Company. The Company selected Morgan Stanley to act
as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s experience in transactions similar to the merger,
qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the Company and its business and the
industries in which the Company conducts its business. As part of this engagement, the Board requested
that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and
appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger agreement. On August 3, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its
oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August
3, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, the merger consideration
to be received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the excluded shares
and appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of shares of the Company common stock, as set forth in such opinion. The full text of Morgan
Stanley’s written opinion to the Board, dated August 3, 2022, is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The
opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion. Company stockholders are urged to, and should, read the
opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Board, in its
capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date
of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the
merger agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address any other term or aspect of the
merger agreement or the transactions or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the merger agreement entered into or amended in connection
therewith and does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could
be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or
recommendation as to how the holders of Company common stock should vote at the special
meeting. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of
the Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company

Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition

Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and
Parent and certain parties and their financial and legal advisors;
Reviewed the merger agreement, the commitment letters from certain lenders (the “reviewed
commitment letters”) and certain related documents; and
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for Morgan Stanley’s
opinion. With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan
Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among
other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the reviewed
commitment letters and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from
the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt
of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed
merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan
Stanley noted that it is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only
and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or
regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion
with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers,
directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be received
by the holders of shares of the Company common stock in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not make
any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor was Morgan Stanley
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Morgan Stanley as of August 3, 2022. Morgan Stanley noted that its opinion is not a solvency opinion and
did not in any way address the solvency or financial condition of the Company and whether other strategic
alternatives existed for the Company or whether such alternatives were available. Morgan Stanley did not
express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement
or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith. Events
occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it,
and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated August 3, 2022 to the Board. The
following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses
performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of
analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. The financial
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The
analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion
of such analyses and of the factors, without considering all analyses and factors reviewed, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Except as otherwise
noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data as it existed on or before July 29, 2022, the last unaffected trading day prior to media
speculation regarding a potential transaction.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, at
the direction of the Board, used and relied upon certain financial projections provided by Company
management on July 23, 2022 and referred to in this proxy statement as the Updated Management Case.
For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger - Certain Financial Forecasts”.
Certain of the following terms are used throughout this summary of financial analyses:
“AAV” refers to adjusted aggregate value, calculated as fully diluted market capitalization plus total
debt, including capitalized operating lease liabilities, plus preferred stock, plus non-controlling interest,
less cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities and short-term investments).
“AV” refers to aggregate value, calculated as fully diluted market capitalization plus total debt,
excluding capitalized operating lease liabilities, plus preferred stock, plus non-controlling interest, less
cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities and short-term investments).
“EBIT” refers to earnings before interest and taxes.
“EBITDA” refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
“EBITDAR” refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value
of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and
terminal value of a company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied values per share of Company
common stock based on estimates of future unlevered free cash flows for the second half of fiscal year
2022 and each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2026 contained in the Updated Management Case. For
purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as EBITDAR, less rent expense, less
unlevered cash tax expense, less change in net working capital, less capital expenditures, plus deferred
taxes.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized a ratio comparing estimated AAV of the Company
to the EBITDAR of the Company for fiscal year 2026, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as “LTM Exit
AAV / EBITDAR”. Morgan Stanley calculated terminal values for the Company by applying a range of
multiples of LTM Exit AAV / EBITDAR of 4.25x to 5.25x, based on Morgan Stanley’s professional
68

THE MERGER
judgment, to the EBITDAR of the Company for the calendar year 2026. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the
terminal value for the capitalized operating leases at December 31, 2026 (based on the Updated
Management Case) and discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present value as of
June 30, 2022 using mid-year convention and a range of discount rates from 6.3% to 7.3%, to reflect an
estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a range of estimated implied values per share of
Company common stock of $93.00 to $113.00, rounded to the nearest dollar, as compared to the
consideration offered and payable pursuant to the merger agreement of $102.50 per share.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a
theoretical estimate of the future implied value of a company’s common equity as a function of that
company’s estimated future earnings. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an
estimate of the implied present value for such company’s potential future per share equity value. In
connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present per share equity
values per share on a stand-alone basis for the Company.
To calculate the discounted per share equity value for the Company, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated
EBITDAR for the next 12 months (which we refer to as “NTM”) following December 31, 2022 of $1,073
million and December 31, 2023 of $958 million based on the Updated Management Case. Based upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a range of multiples of

3.5x to 4.5x, and discounted the resulting equity values to June 30, 2022 at a discount rate of 9.3% based
on Morgan Stanley’s estimate of the Company’s then-current cost of equity. Based on this analysis,
Morgan Stanley derived ranges of estimated implied values per share of Company common stock of
$59.00 to $93.00, rounded to the nearest dollar, discounted as of December 31, 2022 and $54.00 to
$82.00, rounded to the nearest dollar, discounted as of December 31, 2023, and each as compared to the
consideration offered and payable pursuant to the merger agreement of $102.50 per share.

Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis.
Morgan Stanley performed a publicly traded comparable companies analysis, which attempts to provide
an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan
Stanley reviewed and compared, using publicly available information, certain future financial information for
the Company with corresponding future financial information, ratios and public market multiples for other
companies that shared certain similar characteristics to the Company (the “Comparable

following companies:
The Company

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the Comparable Companies and taking into
consideration the different business, financial and operating characteristics of the Comparable Companies
as compared to the Company and considering historical trading multiples of the Company and upon the
application of its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of AAV /
EBITDAR multiples for fiscal year 2022 of 3.5x to 4.5x and applied these ranges of multiples to estimates
of fiscal year 2022 EBITDAR of $1,020 million and $1,043 million, based on the estimated EBITDAR
provided by the Company management in the Updated Management Case and consensus estimates from
Capital IQ as of July 29, 2022, respectively. Morgan Stanley derived a range of an implied

No company utilized in the publicly traded comparable companies analysis is identical to the Company
and hence the foregoing summary and underlying financial analyses involved considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could
affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which the Company was compared. In
evaluating Comparable Companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the business
of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the financial markets
in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using publicly traded comparable
companies data.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Board, including the
following information described below under the sections entitled “- Historical Trading Range”, “- Equity
Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets”, “- Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis” and “- Precedent
Transactions Analysis”.
Historical Trading Range.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of closing prices of the Company common stock
over the 52-week period ended on July 29, 2022, the last full trading day prior to media speculation
regarding a potential sale of the Company. For the 52-week period reviewed, Morgan Stanley observed
that the high and low closing prices of the Company common stock were $59.00 and $96.00 per share,
rounded to the nearest dollar, respectively.
Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for the Company
common stock prepared and published by seven equity research analysts prior to July 29, 2022, the last
full trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company. These forward
targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the 12-month future public market trading price of the
Company common stock. Morgan Stanley also discounted such 12-month future market trading price
estimates by the estimated cost of equity of 9.3% for the Company. Based on the foregoing, the indicative
discounted value range of the research analysts’ price targets for the Company, rounded to the nearest
dollar, was $49.00 to $119.00 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect
current market trading prices for the Company common stock and these estimates are subject to
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company, and future financial market
conditions.

THE MERGER
Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley performed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the
prices at which a financial sponsor might effect a leveraged buyout of the Company. Morgan Stanley
based its analysis on the Updated Management Case. Based on its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley assumed (i) a transaction date of June 30, 2022 and an investment period
ending December 31, 2026, (ii) a target range of annualized internal rates of return for the financial
sponsor of 12.5% to 17.5%, (iii) a 50% debt-to-capitalization ratio and (iv) a range from 4.25x to 5.25x of
AAV / LTM EBITDAR exit multiples. Based on these calculations, this analysis indicated a range of
implied equity value per share of Company common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, of $59.00 to
$85.00 per share.
Precedent Transactions Analysis.
For reference only, Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which attempts to
provide an implied value of a company based on publicly available financial terms of selected precedent
transactions. Based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, the transactions Morgan
Stanley deemed most relevant and reviewed for purposes of this analysis included the acquisition of
Southern Air Holdings (“Southern Air”) by the Company in April 2016 and the acquisition of Omni Air
Internal LLC (“Omni”) by Air Transport Services Group (“ATSG”) in October 2018.
The selected precedent transactions varied significantly based upon company scale, business risks,
growth prospects and geography, as well as the prevailing market environment at the time of such
transactions. Based on its professional judgment and experience and taking into consideration, among
other things, (i) the observed multiples (identified in the table below) for the precedent transactions listed
above, and (ii) the prevailing market environment for the valuation and performance of the companies in the
Company’s industry at the time of each transaction as compared to the current prevailing market trends,
Morgan Stanley applied AV / EBITDA multiples of 5.3x and 5.8x to the Company’s average annual
EBITDA for the past three years of $805 million. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated
estimated implied values per share of Company common stock of $82.00 and $93.00, each rounded to the
nearest dollar, as compared to the consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement of $102.50
per share.

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to the Company or
the merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions
with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition
on the Company’s business or the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse
material change in the financial condition or prospects of the Company or the industry, or in the financial
markets in general.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is
72

THE MERGER
a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that
selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have
given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the range of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan
Stanley’s view of the actual value of the Company.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These include, among other things, the impact of
competition on the business of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence
of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry,
and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from
a financial point of view of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company common stock (other than the excluded shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated August 3, 2022 to the Board.
The merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and
Parent, and was approved by the Board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to the Board during
these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Company or the
Board, nor opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Board in deciding to approve the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board with
respect to the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Board would have
been willing to agree to different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of
Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its customary practice.
The Board retained Morgan Stanley based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise
and its familiarity with the Company. Under the terms of its engagement letter dated June 30, 2022,
Morgan Stanley provided the Company financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this
section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the merger. As
compensation for Morgan Stanley’s financial advisory services, the Company has agreed to pay Morgan
Stanley a fee, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger, of approximately
$60 million (the “Morgan Stanley Transaction Fee”). As compensation for Morgan Stanley rendering a
financial opinion to the Board, the Company paid Morgan Stanley a fee equal to $3 million, which will be
credited against the Morgan Stanley Transaction Fee payable if the merger is consummated. The
Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred from time to

In the event that the Company stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated
for any other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public
company, the Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ, the Company
common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company stockholders will
continue to own their shares of Company common stock and will continue to be subject to the same
general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of the Company common
stock.
If the merger is not consummated, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities
on the future value of your Company common stock, including the risk that the market price of Company
common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of the Company common stock
reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the merger is not consummated,
there is no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the
business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of the Company will not be adversely
impacted. Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain circumstances the Company is permitted to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative transaction. Please see the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning
on page 118.

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the merger (including amounts
needed to pay the aggregate merger consideration and pay all fees, costs and expenses required to be
paid by Parent or MergerCo at or prior to the closing of the merger in connection with the transactions) will
be approximately $5.113 billion in the aggregate, which will be funded via equity financing and debt
financing as described below, and available cash on our balance sheet, if any. We anticipate that the total
funds available to Parent and MergerCo to pay the amounts described above will be up to $3.213 billion in
the aggregate of equity financing pursuant to the equity commitment letters provided by each of the
Consortium Funds and an aggregate amount of $1.9 billion of debt financing. Parent does not anticipate
requiring additional sources of funding in order to consummate the merger. Parent has received a portion
of the aggregate equity commitment for the equity financing from each of the Consortium Funds as
described below in the section entitled “- Equity Financing” and debt commitments for the debt financing
from the debt financing sources as described below in the section entitled “- Debt Financing”.
The consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of any financing.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the equity commitment letters, the Apollo Funds, JFLCO Funds and Hill City Fund have
committed to contribute or cause to be contributed to Parent an aggregate amount in cash equal to
$3.213 billion (or such lesser amount that, together with the debt financing and our and our subsidiaries’
available cash on the closing date (if any), suffices to fully fund the payment of the aggregate merger
consideration to and pay all fees, costs and expenses required to be paid by Parent or MergerCo as set
forth in the merger agreement), solely to fund the obligations thereunder.
Funding of the equity commitment by each of the Consortium Funds is subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth in the equity commitment letters, each of which include: (i) the satisfaction in full
or valid waiver, on or before the closing of the merger, of all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of Parent and MergerCo (other than those conditions precedent that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the closing of the merger, but subject to the concurrent satisfaction or waiver of such conditions precedent
at the closing of the merger), (ii) the substantially concurrent receipt by Parent or MergerCo of the net
cash proceeds of the contemplated debt financing (on the terms and subject to the conditions described
in the debt commitment letter), (iii) the substantially concurrent receipt by Parent and MergerCo of the
funds contemplated by the equity commitment letters of the other Consortium Funds (on the terms and
subject to the conditions described in each of such other equity commitment letters) and (iv) the
substantially concurrent consummation of the closing of the merger.
The obligation of each of the Consortium Funds to fund their respective portion of the equity financing will
terminate automatically upon the earliest to occur of (i) the valid termination of the merger agreement, (ii)
the closing of the merger, (iii) the valid termination of the equity commitment letter of any of the other
Consortium Funds, (iv) the payment in full by such Consortium Fund of its guaranteed obligation pursuant

or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the equity
financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letters.
The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the right granted to Parent to specific performance
under the equity commitment letters and is entitled to enforce Parent’s rights to specific performance of
the Consortium Funds to fund all or any portion of their respective equity financing obligations under the
equity commitment letters, subject to the terms thereof, if the Company is entitled to specific performance
of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity commitment to be funded pursuant to the merger agreement.
Debt Financing
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Parent received the debt commitment letter from
the debt financing sources. Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, the debt financing sources have
committed to provide, severally but not jointly, the credit facilities.
The commitments of the debt financing sources under the debt commitment letter are subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable debt financing sources) of certain conditions precedent, including,
without limitation:
the merger shall be consummated substantially simultaneously or substantially concurrently with the
initial borrowing under the credit facilities in all material respects on the terms described in the merger
agreement, without giving effect to certain material amendments or waivers absent the consent of the
applicable debt financing sources;
since August 4, 2022, there shall not have occurred any change, event, development, occurrence,

the consummation of the merger having occurred or (iii) the closing of the merger occurs without the use
of the term facility.
Limited Guarantees
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guarantee provided by certain of the
Guarantors, the Guarantors have guaranteed certain payment obligations of Parent under the merger
agreement, subject to an aggregate maximum cap of $178,151,634 for the Apollo Guarantors, a maximum
cap of $36,165,577 for the JFLCO Guarantor and a maximum cap of $18,082,789 for the Hill City Fund for
payment of the guaranteed obligations.
Each limited guarantee is irrevocable, and will not terminate until the earliest to occur of (i) the closing of
the merger; (ii) the payment of the guaranteed obligation in full; (iii) the valid termination of the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms in any circumstances other than pursuant to which Parent would
be required pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement to make any
payment of any guaranteed obligation; (iv) 90 days after the valid termination of the merger agreement if
the merger agreement is terminated in any of the circumstances pursuant to which Parent would be
required pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement to make a payment
of the guaranteed obligation if (A) the Company shall have made a claim in writing with respect to such
guaranteed obligation during such 90-day period and (B) the Company shall have commenced an action
during such 90-day period in accordance with the limited guarantee against the Guarantors pursuant to

limited guarantee shall survive solely with respect to amounts claimed or alleged to be so owing; provided,
that with respect to this clause (iv), the Guarantors pursuant to the limited guarantee shall not have any
further liability or obligation under such limited guarantee from and after the earlier of (x) the entry of a

or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the limited guarantees, merger agreement, the equity
commitment letters or any other document or instrument delivered in connection with the limited
guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the foregoing documents or instruments.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to
seek appraisal of their shares of Company common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures
described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their
shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of Company common
stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger
consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are
known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger
consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement.
They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company
common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons
considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company
common stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the
merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to
comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal,
loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions
of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and
financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available
website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a
complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires
to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his,
her or its legal and financial advisors before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The following
summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons
seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal
rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration under the merger agreement.
A holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (i) continuously holds
such shares through the effective time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the merger
or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under
Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in
the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder
of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such
beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and
correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner

determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of
stockholders, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20)
days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or
information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may
be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our
stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, in compliance with the
requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully
review the text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following
publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to
comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal
rights under the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company common stock, you must satisfy each of the
following conditions: you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of
Company common stock before the taking of the vote on the merger, which demand must reasonably
inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company common stock who intends to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company common stock and, for beneficial owners only,
such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial
ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports
to be, and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by
the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List; you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement; you must hold your shares of Company common stock
continuously through the effective time; and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of
Section 262.
A Company stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand
for appraisal to the following address:
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 
2000 Westchester Avenue 
Purchase, NY 10577
Adam R. Kokas, Esq. 
EVP, General Counsel & Secretary
A record holder who holds shares of Company common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker,
fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all
or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the
demand must set forth the number of shares of Company common stock covered by such demand.
Where the number of shares of Company common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares of Company common stock outstanding in the name of such record owner.
Within ten (10) days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the
merger has become effective to each of (i) each Company stockholder who has properly filed a written
demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and

(ii) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60)
days after the effective time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a
proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the merger consideration specified by
the merger agreement for that person’s shares of Company common stock by delivering to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation
and any person who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section
262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served
on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the
fair value of the shares of Company common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal.
There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the surviving corporation to file an appraisal
petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that the Company and the
surviving corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
shares of Company common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their shares of Company
common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights
within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the effective time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease
and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration
under the merger agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, any person who has theretofore
complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive
from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company
common stock not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were
received by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement
must be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving
corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as
described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the
surviving corporation. The surviving corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such
service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of
Company common stock and with whom the surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the
value of such shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court,
shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail
to the surviving corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court
will determine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights
provided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares of Company common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their
certificates of shares of Company common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to comply with such direction, the
Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, the
shares of the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange, the
Delaware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the

THE MERGER
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided
in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List
may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through
such proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of Company common stock
taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time through the date
the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge)
as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may
pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such
payment only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the
shares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (ii) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.
When the fair value of the shares of Company common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct
the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize
that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the
merger consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the
merger consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of the relevant shares of Company
common stock is less than the merger consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving
the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair
value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the merger
which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is
to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value”, but which rather applies only to the
speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.

Treatment of Company Long-Term Incentive Awards
For information regarding beneficial ownership of shares of Company common stock by each of the
Company’s directors and executive officers and all of such directors and executive officers as a group,
please see the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”,
beginning on page 123. Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive,
for each share of Company common stock he or she holds, the same per share merger consideration in
cash in the same manner as other Company stockholders.
As described further in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Long-Term
Incentive Awards” beginning on page 96, each Company RSU and Company PSU outstanding as of
August 4, 2022 and immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled in exchange for a
lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration for each share of Company common stock
subject to such Company RSU and Company PSU, assuming the achievement of all applicable PSU
performance criteria at the maximum level (such performance criteria are currently trending at or near the
maximum level irrespective of the transaction) (generally at 240% of target levels). Company cash awards
outstanding as of August 4, 2022 and immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled in
exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the amount that would have been payable under the
applicable award agreement assuming all relevant conditions were met and the maximum level of
achievement of any applicable performance criteria (such performance criteria are currently trending at or
near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction) (generally 240% of target levels for awards other
than those subject solely to service reliability goals and 110% for those subject solely to service reliability
goals). In addition, under the 401(k) Restoration Plan, each executive officer is eligible for a 5% employer
credit on eligible compensation, which includes amounts paid in respect of Company cash awards. With
respect to each post-signing cash award, such award will vest and be paid in equal annual installments
over the three-year period from the applicable grant date, with such post-signing cash award vesting and
being paid in equal annual installments over the three-year period from the applicable grant date, with
accelerated vesting terms upon a qualifying termination of employment.
As of October 18, 2022 (the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this
proxy statement) and assuming that (i) all Company RSUs are valued based on the merger consideration
of $102.50 per share, (ii) the merger closes on December 31, 2022, which is the assumed closing date
only for purposes of this compensation-related disclosure and (iii) the directors do not receive any
Company long-term incentive awards or post-signing cash awards or forfeit any Company long-term
incentive awards prior to December 31, 2022, each of the Company’s non-employee directors holds
unvested Company RSUs with a value of $161,745. None of the Company’s non-employee directors holds
Company PSUs or Company cash awards. See “- Quantification of Payments and Benefits” below for the
value of the Company long-term incentive awards held by each of the Company’s executive officers.
Severance Entitlements
Employment Agreement with Mr. Dietrich
Mr. Dietrich is subject to an employment agreement with the Company, as amended, which provides that
if Mr. Dietrich is terminated by the Company without “Cause” or he resigns with “Good Reason”  (each, as
defined in Mr. Dietrich’s employment agreement) within 18 months following a change in control of the
Company (the “CIC Protection Period”), he would be eligible to receive, subject to his execution of a
release of claims in favor of the Company: (i) a lump-sum payment equal to 36 months of his then-current
base salary, (ii) in respect of the year of termination, a payment under the Company’s annual incentive
plan calculated based on the greater of target and actual performance and (iii) continued coverage under

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE MERGER
the Company’s health plans for Mr. Dietrich and his eligible dependents until he becomes eligible for
Medicare or is eligible to be covered by the health plan of a subsequent employer. Mr. Dietrich’s
employment agreement provides that upon a termination by the Company without Cause or his
resignation with Good Reason within six months prior to a change in control, he would also generally be
entitled to the benefits described in the immediately preceding sentence.
In the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Dietrich would constitute a parachute payment
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), then
Mr. Dietrich will either receive all such payments and benefits in full or such payments and benefits will be
reduced to the greatest amount that does not trigger the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code,
whichever results in the greater after-tax amount for Mr. Dietrich (a “280G best-net cutback”).
Benefits Program for Other Executive Officers
The Benefits Program for Senior Executives (the “Benefits Program”), in which each named executive
officer other than Mr. Dietrich participates, provides that if the executive officer’s employment is terminated
by the Company without “Cause” or he resigns with “Good Reason”  (each as defined in the Benefits
Program) during the CIC Protection Period, he will be eligible to receive, subject to execution of a release
of claims in favor of the Company: (i) 36 months of base salary continuation, (ii) in respect of the year of
termination, a payment under the Company’s annual incentive plan calculated based on the greater of
target and actual performance and (iii) (a) reimbursement of COBRA premiums for 12 months following
termination and (b) continued coverage under the Company’s health plans until the executive officer
becomes eligible for Medicare coverage or is eligible to be covered by the health plan of a subsequent
employer. The Benefits Program includes a 280G best-net cutback provision.
401(k) Restoration Plan
The Company’s executive officers participate in the 401(k) Restoration Plan, which is a nonqualified
excess defined contribution plan. Deferrals and employer credits, including all credits in respect of eligible
earnings, under the 401(k) Restoration Plan are credited with notional earnings and balances will be
distributed upon a change in control of the Company (which includes the merger).
Retention Awards
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company may establish a cash-based retention award
program for the benefit of certain Company employees. Pursuant to the program, Parent and management
of the Company will mutually agree to identify and allocate amounts to program participants. As of the
date of this proxy statement, no directors or executive officers have been allocated awards under this
program.
Treatment of Annual Bonuses
The merger agreement provides that if the effective time occurs during the calendar year ending December
31, 2022, each Continuing Employee (as defined below) who is eligible to receive a bonus under the
Company’s annual incentive plan in respect of 2022 (the “2022 Annual Bonuses”) will receive such bonus
at the time that such bonuses are paid in the ordinary course of business, with payout calculated based
on the greater of target or actual performance. In the event an employee’s, including an executive officer’s,
on the greater of target or actual performance. In the event an employee’s, including an executive officer’s,
employment is terminated by the Company without cause or the employee resigns with “Good Reason” or
“Change in Control Good Reason” or dies or becomes disabled (in each case, as defined in the applicable
Company annual incentive plan) prior to December 31, 2022, he or she will

remain eligible to receive his or her respective 2022 Annual Bonus, and such bonus will not be prorated,
subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in the Company’s standard form.
Arrangements with Apollo, JFLCO, Hill City and Parent
Prior to the effective time, the Company’s executive officers expect to enter into discussions with the
Consortium, Apollo, JFLCO, Hill City, Parent or their respective affiliates regarding future compensation
arrangements. However, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company’s directors or
executive officers has entered into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding with the
Consortium, Apollo, JFLCO, Hill City, Parent or any of their respective affiliates regarding employment, or
providing for any compensation or benefits, following the effective time, and the merger is not conditioned
upon any such agreement, arrangement or understanding being entered into.
Section 280G Mitigation Actions
As described above, all executive officers are subject to a 280G best-net cutback. The Company, in
consultation with Parent, is permitted to take certain actions before the effective time to mitigate the
amount of potential “excess parachute payments” for “disqualified individuals”  (each, as defined in Section
280G of the Code), including accelerating the vesting or payment of a portion of each executive officer’s
compensation that would be paid in a future year or at the effective time. As of the date of this proxy
statement, the Company has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate the expected impact of
Section 280G of the Code on the Company and any disqualified individuals. In the event a disqualified
individual has any payments or vesting accelerated, any such accelerated payments would be subject to
repayment if the individual experiences a termination of employment by the Company for cause or in the
event the individual resigns from employment, in each case, prior to the date the accelerated payment
would have ordinarily vested or been made. No tax or other gross-ups have been or will be provided to any
named executive officer, whether related to Section 280G of the Code or otherwise.
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and officers of the Company will
be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies following the merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger agreement
relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 115.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s
named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are payable in connection with
or otherwise relate to the merger. The Company stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory
only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger
agreement proposal is approved by the Company stockholders and the merger is consummated, the
compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation,
subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below
and above under “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-
K. The estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the merger is consummated
86
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement
 
 
 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE MERGER
on December 31, 2022, (ii) the per share merger consideration of $102.50, (iii) the named executive
officers’ salary as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (iv) the number of unvested Company
long-term incentive awards held by the named executive officers as of October 18, 2022, the latest
practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, less any awards
expected to vest in the ordinary course prior to December 31, 2022, and assuming no additional grants or
forfeitures of Company long-term incentive awards or post-signing cash awards will be made prior to
December 31, 2022 and (v) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination of
employment immediately following the consummation of the merger under circumstances that entitle such
named executive officer to receive severance (i.e., a termination without “Cause” or resignation for “Good
Reason”). As such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may
or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect
certain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger. As a result, the
actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts
set forth below.

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of the cash severance each executive is eligible to
receive upon a “Qualifying Termination”, which is defined as a termination without Cause or for Good Reason within the
CIC Protection Period, and consists of three times the executive’s base salary (as described in the section entitled “-
Severance Entitlements”). Each named executive officer’s cash severance payments are “double-trigger”, as such
payments will not be payable solely as a result of the occurrence of the effective time, but would also require a
Qualifying Termination. The amounts shown in the column are consistent with the pre-existing severance terms under
Mr. Dietrich’s employment agreement and the Benefits Program for Senior Executives, as applicable. The amounts do not
include any bonus payments in respect of the year of termination because these amounts assume that a Qualifying
Termination occurs on December 31, 2022 and any such bonus payments would be deemed earned by the named
executive officers.
The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of the executive’s unvested Company long-
term incentive awards, including a 5% employer credit on Company cash awards under the 401(k) Restoration Plan. As
described in the section entitled “- Treatment of Company Long-Term Incentive Awards”, at the effective time, each
Company RSU and Company PSU will vest and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the
merger consideration multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Company RSU or Company PSU, assuming the
maximum level of achievement of any applicable Company PSU performance criteria (such performance criteria are
currently trending at or near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction). Each Company cash award will vest
and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the amount payable under the applicable award
agreement assuming all relevant conditions were met and the maximum level of achievement of any applicable Company
cash award performance criteria (such performance criteria are currently trending at or near the maximum level
irrespective of the transaction). The long-term incentive award amounts shown in this column will be payable on the
effective time regardless of whether or not the executive’s employment is terminated.
The amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate account balance of each named executive officer in the
401(k) Restoration Plan that would vest upon the effective time, as described more fully in the section entitled “- 401(k)
Restoration Plan”. In addition, under the 401(k) Restoration Plan, each executive officer is eligible for a 5% employer
credit on eligible compensation, which includes amounts paid in respect of Company cash awards, and is included in the
“Long-Term Incentives” column of this table. Vesting and payment of the 401(k) Restoration Plan account balance will be
payable on the

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders with
respect to the disposition of Company common stock pursuant to the merger. It is not intended to be a
complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and
does not address consequences to holders of Company long-term incentive awards or Company
Warrants. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code and all of which are subject to change
or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of
the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax
consequences described in this discussion.
This discussion assumes that holders of Company common stock hold their shares as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Company
common stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special
considerations applicable to holders of Common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships
or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or
other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in
securities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign
investment companies, U.S. expatriates, holders who acquired their shares of Company common stock
through vesting of units or otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax,
holders who hold their shares of Company common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale
or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an “applicable financial statement”  (as defined in Section 451
of the Code) and holders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of the
Company common stock (by vote or value) outstanding. In addition, this discussion does not address any
tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-
income tax consequences (e.g., the federal estate or gift tax or the application of the Medicare tax on net
investment income under Section 1411 of the Code).
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common
stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner

and activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding common stock, you should
consult your own tax advisor.
All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to
them (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax
laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the
merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock, that

authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; or
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity classified as a partnership
that is subject to U.S. federal income tax reporting) of Company common stock that is not a U.S. holder.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock converted into cash pursuant to the
merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term
capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a
reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If
a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Company common stock at different times or at different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to
each block of common stock.
A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding (at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the merger, unless such
holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes
the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE MERGER
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required
by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of
an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case
the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder
and, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch
profits tax at the rate of 30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be specified
by an applicable income tax treaty);
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-
U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate)
on any gain derived from the disposition of the Company common stock pursuant to the merger (other
than gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be offset by U.S. source
capital losses; or
the Company stock constitutes a “United States real property interest”  (“USRPI”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”).
If our shares of Company common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. holder would be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain or loss recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for
such shares of Company common stock in the merger on a net basis at applicable U.S. graduated rates
in the same manner as a U.S. holder, and such cash consideration may also be subject to the U.S.
federal withholding tax under FIRPTA at a rate of 15%. A non-U.S. holder’s shares of Company common
stock generally will not constitute a USRPI, and gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder upon receipt of
cash in exchange for our shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income or U.S. federal withholding tax under FIRPTA, if our shares of Company
common stock are “regularly traded”  (within the meaning of applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations) on an
established securities market at the effective time (and the non-U.S. holder holds 5% or less of the total
fair market value of such class of shares at all times during the shorter of (x) the five-year period ending
with the effective date of the merger and (y) the non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares). We
believe we have not been a “United States real property holding corporation” for United States federal
income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in
light of their particular facts and circumstances, the procedures for claiming treaty benefits or otherwise
establishing an exemption from U.S. withholding tax with respect to any portion of the cash consideration
payable to them pursuant to the merger.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup
withholding will apply with respect to the cash received by such holder pursuant to the merger, unless
such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does
not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as defined under
the Code) or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such
non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

On October 7, 2022, a complaint, captioned Stein v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No.
1:22-cv-08555, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by
plaintiff Shiva Stein, a purported Company stockholder (the “Stein complaint”), and on October 14, 2022, a
complaint, captioned Okin v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08778, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by plaintiff Alexander Okin, a
purported Company stockholder, in each case naming as defendants the Company and members of the
Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed a materially
incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC relating to the
merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the
merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly
omitted from the preliminary proxy statement, rescinding the merger agreement or any of the terms
thereof to the extent already implemented or granting rescissory damages, awarding the plaintiff the costs
and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and
granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Stein complaint
additionally seeks an order directing the defendants to account to the plaintiff for all damages suffered as
a result of the alleged wrongdoing.
On October 18, 2022, the Company also received a demand letter from a purported Company stockholder
alleging disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy statement and demanding that the Company and
the Board promptly issue corrective disclosures to cure the proxy statement prior to the anticipated
stockholder vote on the merger.
The Company has not yet formally responded to the complaints or to the demand, but believes that the
allegations contained therein are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement the
proxy statement under applicable laws. As of October 18, 2022, the Company was not aware of the filing
of other lawsuits challenging the merger or the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits may be filed in
the future.",100,100

The parties to the merger agreement intend to, and are obligated to, cooperate with each other and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, amongst other things,
(i) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, exemptions, clearances,
orders and other confirmations from any governmental authority or third-party necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions and (ii) defend or contest in good faith any action or judgment
that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the
consummation of the transactions, in each case, as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Reasonable Best Efforts”. The management of each of the Company
and Parent currently believe that the necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained in the fourth quarter
of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023; however, there can be no assurances that such approvals will be
obtained in accordance with this timing or at all.
HSR Act Clearance
Consummation of the merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the rules promulgated by
the FTC, which prevent transactions such as the merger from being consummated until (i) certain

THE MERGER
information and materials are furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and (ii) the applicable waiting period is
terminated early or expires. The FTC and DOJ have currently suspended the practice of granting early
termination under the HSR Act. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and
Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on August 12, 2022. On September 12,
2022, Parent withdrew its filing and refiled on September 14, 2022 in order to provide the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ with an additional 30-day period to review the filings. The waiting period
applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act expired on October 14, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of
the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws
as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold
separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the
completion of the merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion
of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to
take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a
challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other U.S. Regulatory Approvals
Consummation of the merger is also subject to receipt of certain additional consents, approvals or other
clearances (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties, if permissible under
applicable law), consisting of receipt of approvals from the DOT and the FCC.
There can be no assurance that the requisite approvals will be obtained on a timely basis or at all.
Non-U.S. Regulatory Approvals
Consummation of the merger is also subject to receipt of certain additional consents, approvals or other
clearances (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties, if permissible under
applicable law), consisting of receipt of a clearance decision by (i) the European Union pursuant to
Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 for Europe, (ii) the People’s Republic of China pursuant to the Anti-
monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, (iii) the Republic of Korea pursuant to The Monopoly
Regulation and Fair Trade Act for Korea and (iv) Japan pursuant to The Antimonopoly Act for Japan. The
parties made the required filings with the European Union on September 13, 2022, the People’s Republic
of China on September 16, 2022, the Republic of Korea on September 26, 2022 and Japan on September
30, 2022. Antitrust clearance in the People’s Republic of China was received on October 13, 2022.
In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory
laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the
parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a
challenge is made, we will prevail.
Additional Approvals
In addition, the parties expect to submit a notice of the transactions to the U.S. Defense
Counterintelligence and Security Agency (the “DCSA”).
The Company and Parent also intend to make all required filings under the Exchange Act relating to the
merger and obtain all other approvals and consents that may be necessary to give effect to the merger.

purport to be complete, may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is
important to you, and is qualified in its entirety by the full merger agreement, as attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A. We recommend that you read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety,
as the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The merger agreement is included with this proxy statement only to provide you with information regarding
the terms of the merger agreement and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding the
Company, Parent, MergerCo or their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or businesses. The merger
agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the merger agreement.
These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the
merger agreement and:
have been made only for purposes of the merger agreement;
have been qualified by certain documents filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company prior to
August 4, 2022;
have been qualified by confidential disclosures made by the Company in connection with the merger
agreement;
are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the merger agreement that may differ from what
may be viewed as material by investors;
were made only as of the date of the merger agreement or such other date as is specified in the
merger agreement; and
have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and MergerCo, on the other hand, rather than establishing matters as
facts.
You should not rely on the representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company, Parent, MergerCo or any of their respective
subsidiaries, affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may have changed (and may continue to change) after the date of the
merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s
public disclosures.
Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not
be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy
statement and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The Company will
provide additional disclosure in its public reports of any material information necessary to provide the
Company stockholders with a materially complete understanding of the disclosures relating to the merger

the merger agreement.
For purposes of the merger agreement, a “Material Adverse Effect” with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries means any effect, change, event or occurrence that (i) has, or would be reasonably expected
to have, a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) other than for purposes of the “absence of certain
changes” representation in the merger agreement, would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay, interfere with, impair or hinder the consummation by the Company of the merger or the
transactions or the compliance by the Company with its obligations under the merger agreement;
provided, however, that solely with respect to the foregoing clause (i) none of the following, and no effect,
change, event or occurrence arising out of, or resulting from, the following, will constitute or be taken into

be expected to occur: any effect, change, event or occurrence (A) generally affecting the industry in which
the Company and its subsidiaries operate or the economy, credit or financial or capital markets generally,
in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, monetary policy or

performance of the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions (other than for purposes of
any representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.04(d) and 3.05 of the merger agreement), including
the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors,
partners, employees or regulators to the extent relating to the identity of Parent or MergerCo, or any
litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or violation of law, (3) acts of war (whether or
not declared), military activity, sabotage, civil disobedience or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of
any such acts of war (whether or not declared), military activity, sabotage, civil disobedience or terrorism,

events, casualty events, force majeure events or other comparable events, (5) any action taken by the

market price, or change in trading volume, of the shares of the Company, (8) any failure to meet any
internal or public projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, milestones, budgets or internal or published
financial or operating predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it being understood that
the exceptions in clauses (6), (7) and (8) will not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that the
underlying cause of any such change, decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within
any of the exceptions provided by clause (A) and clauses (B)(1) through (8)) is a Material Adverse Effect)
or (9) any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak (including COVID-19) or any “COVID-19 Measures”

following August 4, 2022; provided further, however, that any effect, change, event or occurrence referred to
in clause (A) or clauses (B)(1), (3), (4) or (9) may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Material Adverse Effect to the extent such effect, change,
event or occurrence has a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other participants in the industry in which the Company and its subsidiaries
operate (in which case only the incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Material
Adverse Effect).

occurrence that would prevent or materially delay, materially interfere with, materially hinder or materially
impair (i) the consummation by Parent or MergerCo of any of the transactions on a timely basis or (ii) the
compliance by Parent or MergerCo with its obligations under the merger agreement.

The Board has agreed that neither it, nor any duly authorized committee thereof, will:
(i) fail to include the Company’s recommendation in this proxy statement, (ii) withdraw or withhold (or
modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw or withhold (or modify,

where the adverse recommendation change is not made in response to a takeover proposal, an
intervening event (as defined below) has occurred and failure to effect an adverse recommendation
change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided that none of the following will constitute an intervening event: (i) any action
that is taken by Parent to the extent required by the affirmative covenants set forth in the merger
agreement, and the consequences of any such action, and (ii) any change in the market price, trading
volume or ratings of any securities or indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided
that the underlying causes of any such change may be considered in determining whether an
intervening event has occurred; and
where the adverse recommendation change is made in response to a takeover proposal, that such
takeover proposal constitutes a superior proposal and the failure to effect an adverse recommendation
change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
The Board will not, and will cause the Company not to, make an adverse recommendation change unless
(i) the Company has given Parent at least four calendar days’ prior written notice of its intention to take
such action, (ii) the Company has negotiated with, and has caused its representatives to negotiate with,
Parent in good faith, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, in order to enable Parent to revise the
terms of the merger agreement so that the failure to make such an adverse recommendation change
would no longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary
duties under applicable law and (iii) following the Company’s and its representatives’ negotiation in good
faith with Parent, the Board (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
determines in good faith that the failure to make such an adverse recommendation change would no
longer be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Board will not cause the Company to enter into a company acquisition agreement with respect to a
takeover proposal unless (i) the Company has given Parent at least four calendar days’ prior written notice
of its intention to take such action, and the Company will have contemporaneously provided a copy of the
relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements with the person, group or entity making such superior
proposal, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, in order to enable Parent to propose in writing a
binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the merger agreement such that it would cause such
superior proposal to no longer constitute a superior proposal, and (iii) following the end of such notice
period, the Board will have considered in good faith such binding offer, and will, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, have determined that the superior proposal would continue to
constitute a superior proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect.
Any termination of the merger agreement pursuant an adverse recommendation change or the Company
entering into a company acquisition agreement with respect to a takeover proposal will be void and of no
force and effect unless the termination is in accordance with the merger agreement and, to the extent
required under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company pays to Parent the applicable company
termination fee.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “acceptable confidentiality agreement” means (i) any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after August 4, 2022 that contains
confidentiality provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement between the Company and certain affiliates of the Consortium
Funds, except that such confidentiality agreement (A) need not include explicit or implicit standstill
provisions or otherwise restrict the making of or amendment or modification to takeover

proposals, (B) will not prohibit the Company from complying with the merger agreement or restrict its
ability to consummate merger transactions and (C) will not include any provision calling for an exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company prior to a valid termination of the merger agreement, or (ii) any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to August 4, 2022 (provided that the Company is entitled to
waive or release any preexisting explicit or implicit standstill provisions or similar agreements with any
person, entity or group to the extent said provision would prohibit them from making, negotiating or
effecting a takeover proposal). For purposes of the merger agreement, “merger transactions” mean,
collectively, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, but excluding,
in any event, the equity financing (as defined in the definition of the equity commitment letters) and the
debt financing (as defined in the definition of debt commitment letter).
For purposes of the merger agreement, “takeover proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person, entity or group (other than Parent and its subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series
of related transactions, any direct or indirect:
acquisition or license of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries
(based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board or any duly authorized committee
thereof) or 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of the Company are attributable,
including through the acquisition of one or more subsidiaries of the Company owning such assets;
acquisition or issuance of securities (whether by merger, consolidation, spin-off, share exchange
(including a split-off), business combination or similar transaction involving an acquisition of the
Company) representing 20% or more of the voting power of any class of equity or voting securities of
the Company (including Company common stock);
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person, entity or group
beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding
Company common stock; and
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which such person,
entity or group (or the stockholders thereof) would acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as
determined by the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof) or to which 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues or earnings of the Company are attributable or securities representing 20% or
more of the aggregate voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities or of the surviving
entity in a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving the
Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each
case, other than the merger transactions.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any bona fide written takeover proposal
made after August 4, 2022 that was not solicited in breach of the merger agreement, that the Board or
any duly authorized committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after taking into account the certainty and timing of
closing and all legal, regulatory, financial, financing and other aspects of such proposal, (i) would be more
favorable to the Company stockholders than the merger transactions from a financial point of view and (ii)
is reasonably capable of being completed (if accepted) in accordance with its terms (provided, that for
purposes of the definition of “superior proposal”, the references to “20%” in the definition of takeover
proposal will be deemed to be references to “50%”).
For purposes of the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means any material event or development or
material change in circumstances with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole

Each of the parties to the merger agreement has agreed to cooperate with the other parties and use (and
cause their respective controlled affiliates to use) their reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any
action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for in the merger agreement) to as promptly
as reasonably practicable:
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to closing

defend or contest in good faith any action brought by any governmental authority or a third party or any
judgment that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect
the consummation of the transactions.
The Company and Parent also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action necessary to
ensure that no anti-takeover law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions and refrain from
taking any actions that would cause the applicability of such laws, and (ii) if the restrictions of any anti-
takeover law become applicable to any of the transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that

such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the
merger agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such anti-takeover laws on such
transactions.
Parent and the Company agreed to jointly, and on an equal basis, (i) control the timing and strategy for
obtaining any approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, exemptions,
clearances, orders and other confirmations from any aviation regulators in connection with the
transactions and (ii) coordinate the overall development of the positions to be taken and the regulatory
actions to be requested in any filing or submission with an aviation regulator in connection with the
transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before, or any
negotiations with, an aviation regulator relating to the transactions and of all other regulatory matters
incidental thereto, including any notice filing with the DOT regarding a substantial change in operations,
ownership or management. Parent will solely control the timing and strategy for obtaining any approvals,
consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, exemptions, clearances, orders and other
confirmations from any other governmental authorities in connection with the transactions and coordinate
the overall development of the positions to be taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in any

connection with any investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before, or any negotiations with, any
such other governmental authority relating to the transactions and of all other regulatory matters incidental
thereto, including the final content of any substantive communications with any applicable governmental
authority; provided that Parent will take into considerations the Company’s views, suggestions and
comments regarding non-confidential strategy, efforts and positions to be taken and regulatory actions
requested in any filing or submission with such other governmental authority.
Each of the parties also agreed to file a notification and report form under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions (which will request the early termination of any applicable waiting period) as promptly as
reasonably practicable following August 4, 2022, and in any event within 10 days following August 4,
2022, and to supply (and cause their respective affiliates or, if required pursuant to the HSR Act, the
parties to the equity commitment letters or their affiliates) as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to
promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under any antitrust laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local
governmental authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to the
merger agreement to consummate the transactions.
The Company and Parent will respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any
objections asserted by any governmental authority related to the transactions. Each of the Company,
Parent and MergerCo will not take (and will cause their respective affiliates not to take) any action with the
intention to, or that would, hinder or delay the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the
HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the DOJ or FTC, as necessary. Nothing in the merger agreement
requires any party thereto to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations
unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the closing. Neither Parent nor
the Company will commit (and will cause their respective affiliates not to commit) to or agree with any
governmental authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
antitrust laws or enter into a timing agreement with any government authority without the prior written

period will end on any earlier date on which the debt financing has been obtained.
Efforts
The merger agreement provides that each of Parent and MergerCo will use, and will cause their affiliates
to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the equity financing and debt
financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the “market flex” provisions) set forth
in the equity commitment letter and debt commitment letters, including using reasonable best efforts to:
maintain in effect and comply with the commitment letters;
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to debt financing on the terms and subject
only to the conditions (including the “market flex” provisions) set forth in the debt commitment letter or
on terms, other than with respect to conditionality, not materially less favorable to Parent or MergerCo
than the terms and conditions (including “market flex” provisions) set forth in the debt commitment
letter;
satisfy (or cause its affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to the funding or investing of
the financing applicable to Parent and its affiliates in the commitment letters and the definitive
agreements related thereto that are within their control that are to be satisfied by Parent or MergerCo;

affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other entities committing to fund
the financing to fund such financing at the closing of the merger; and
enforce its rights under the commitment letters and any definitive agreements relating to the financing
of the merger.
Parent and MergerCo may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any
termination of or amendment or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the
commitment letters if such termination, amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of the financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the financing or otherwise
adversely expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the financing, or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any other provision of the commitment letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the funding of the financing on the closing date or (C) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or MergerCo, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the commitment letters.
Prior to the closing date, the Company has agreed that the Company and its subsidiaries will use their
reasonable best efforts to provide, and will cause their representatives to use reasonable best efforts to
provide, to Parent and MergerCo, in each case at Parent’s sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent, as more fully set forth in the merger agreement, to assist Parent in causing the
conditions in the debt commitment letter to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent or the debt financing sources in connection with the financings contemplated by the debt
commitment letter (including any offering or private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).
Parent and MergerCo obtaining financing, including any alternative financing, is not a condition to the
consummation of the merger.

The merger agreement is governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles. Any legal, regulatory
or administrative proceeding, suit, investigation, arbitration or action arising out of or relating to the merger
agreement or the transactions will be heard and determined in the Delaware Court (or, if the Delaware
Court declines to accept jurisdiction over any action, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware).

have agreed that any legal action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any debt financing sources or their affiliates arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or to

of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof), and that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any provisions in the merger

The parties agreed that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including the termination fees
described above in the section entitled “- Termination Fees”), even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of the merger agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties fail to take any action
required of them to consummate the merger agreement and the transactions.
Subject to certain limitations, the parties acknowledged and agreed that the parties are entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the merger
agreement; that the termination fees described above in the section entitled “- Termination Fees” do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of the merger agreement and will not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair a party’s right to specific enforcement; and that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions and without that right neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into the merger agreement. The parties agreed not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agreed that no debt financing source or its affiliates will have
any liability to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates relating to or arising out of the merger
agreement, any of the transactions contemplated thereby, the debt commitment letter or any debt
financing, or any performance thereof, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, nor will the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates be entitled to specific performance of
any commitment letter (including the debt commitment letter) or similar agreement entered into by Parent

HOUSEHOLDING
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the
delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more Company
stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those
Company stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially
means extra convenience for Company stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders may be “householding” proxy materials. A
single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple Company stockholders sharing an address unless
contrary instructions have been received from the affected Company stockholders. If you have received
notice from your broker that they will be “householding” communications to your address, such
“householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any
time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement, please notify your broker and write or call us at the following address or phone number: Atlas
Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Attention: Office of the Secretary, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., 2000
Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577, (914) 701-8000. Company stockholders who currently receive
multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request “householding” of their
communications should contact their brokers. We will promptly deliver an additional copy of the proxy
statement to any Company stockholder who so requests.

participation in any future stockholder meetings. Until the merger is consummated, you will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in stockholders meetings, including the Company’s annual meetings of
Company stockholders, and we will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the
2023 annual meeting of Company stockholders will be held.
Company stockholders are entitled to present proposals for action and director nominations at the 2023

the proxy rules established by the SEC and the applicable provisions of our by-laws. Under the rules of
the SEC, if a stockholder wants us to include a proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for
presentation at our 2023 annual meeting of Company stockholders, the proposal must be received by our
Secretary no later than December 16, 2022. All stockholder proposals must be made in writing and
addressed to the Office of the Secretary, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., 2000 Westchester Avenue,
Purchase, NY 10577.
Notices of proxy access director nominees for the 2023 annual meeting of Company stockholders must
include the information required by our by-laws and delivered to our Secretary at our principal executive
offices at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577 not earlier than November 16, 2022 and not
later than December 16, 2022. A copy of our by-laws will be sent to any stockholder upon written request
to the Secretary.
In addition, under our by-laws, and as permitted by the rules of the SEC, no stockholder nominations of
persons for election to the Board (other than a director nominee nominated for inclusion in our proxy
materials pursuant to our proxy access by-law) and no other business may be brought before the 2023
annual meeting of Company stockholders except as specified in the notice of the meeting or otherwise
brought before such annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board or by a stockholder entitled to vote
who has delivered notice to us (containing certain information specified in our by-laws) not earlier than
January 31, 2023 and no later than March 2, 2023. A copy of the by-laws will be sent to any stockholder
upon written request to the Secretary of the Company. These requirements are separate and apart from,
and in addition to, the SEC’s requirements that a stockholder must meet in order to have his or her
proposal included in our proxy statement as discussed above.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the
Closing Date shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). Pending its disbursement in accordance with
this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in
(i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America (“U.S.”), (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the U.S. is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. In the event the amount
of the Exchange Fund decreases, as a result of losses with respect to such investments, or otherwise
diminishes below the level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of
Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of a Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares not held,
directly or indirectly, through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) (other than (i) a Share
Certificate representing a share of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b) and (ii) Appraisal Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.07)
(x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Share Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Share Certificates (or affidavits in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent or, in the case of such Book-
Entry Shares upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent, as applicable, in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c).

(ii) Upon delivery of a letter of transmittal (duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto) and either (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of Share Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Share Certificates as provided in this Section 2.02 and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent) or (B) transfer of
Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary
form by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such other
reasonable evidence, if any, of surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), in each case as contemplated in subsection (i) of this Section
2.02(b), the holder of such Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Share Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02,
each Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.
(iii) The Persons who were, at the Effective Time, holders of Book-Entry Shares (other than (i)
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) or (ii)
Appraisal Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.07) held, directly or
indirectly, through DTC shall not be required to deliver a Share Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 2.02. With respect to such Book-Entry Shares held, directly or
indirectly, through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other necessary third-party intermediaries to
ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in
accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by
Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other necessary third-
party intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled
to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to this Section 2.02.
(iv) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Share Certificate is registered, Parent may cause the Paying Agent
to pay the Merger Consideration to such Person only if such Share Certificate (if applicable) is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any
applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Persons in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer records of the Company.
(v) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender of any Company
Common Stock.
(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all ownership rights in such common stock, and at the Effective
Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the

Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Share Certificate as
contemplated by this Article II.
(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been disbursed to
holders of Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders who have not
heretofore complied with this Article II shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for,
payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties
hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(g) Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent,
MergerCo, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld under applicable Tax Law. If any of Parent, MergerCo, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates determines that it is required to deduct and
withhold any amount payable to a holder of Company Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.02(g), then
it shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a notice to such holder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding is required to be made setting forth the amount of the anticipated
deduction and withholding and (ii) cooperate with such holder in good faith to minimize the amount of
deduction and withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the relevant Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Debt Commitment Letter), there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or MergerCo is a
party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof that could (i)

Commitment Letter as and when they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date.
(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and MergerCo, as the case may be, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, except, in each case, as such

or breach on the part of Parent or MergerCo or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
under any of the Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition on the part of
Parent or MergerCo under any of the Commitment Letters or (iii) assuming the satisfaction of the

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of conditions to Parent’s and
MergerCo’s obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters applicable to Parent or
MergerCo, as applicable, will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing required to
satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into consideration the available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) will not be made available to Parent in full on the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing
is funded and/or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters, as applicable, (after netting out
applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving
effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt
Commitment Letter and any related fee letter), Parent and MergerCo will have on the Closing Date
funds sufficient (after taking into consideration the available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries)

all fees and expenses required to be paid at Closing by Parent and MergerCo in connection with the
Merger and the Financing, (iii) prepay or repay any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its

obligations required to be paid at Closing by Parent and MergerCo hereunder in connection with the
Transactions (clauses (i) through (iv), the “Financing Uses”).
(g) The obligations of Parent and MergerCo to consummate the Transactions on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement are not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parent’s
consummation of any financing arrangement, Parent or any of its Affiliates obtaining any financing
(including the Financing or any Alternative Financing) or the availability, grant, provision or extension of
any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Financing or any Alternative Financing).
SECTION 4.06. Solvency. Neither Parent nor MergerCo is entering into this Agreement (and none of the
Guarantors are entering into their respective Limited Guarantees) with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a)
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, (b) the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III and (c) the solvency of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to giving effect to the Transactions, including the payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other amounts required to be paid in pursuant to Article II
(including all amounts payable in respect of Equity-Based Awards, Company Warrants and 2024
Convertible Notes under this Agreement) and the funding of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment
Letters, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the applicable Transactions. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term “Solvent”, when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination, (i) the fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) the present fair saleable value
of the property of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (iii) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be
conducted following the date of determination.
Other than this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantees and the Confidentiality
Agreement, there are no Contracts or other arrangements or commitments to enter into Contracts or other
arrangements between Parent, MergerCo, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any member of the Company’s management or Board of Directors or any beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock, on the other hand, that relate in any material way to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including those businesses and Subsidiaries following the Closing) or the Transactions
(including as to continuing employment or equity roll-over).
SECTION 4.07. U.S. Citizen; Air Carrier. Each of Parent and MergerCo is a “citizen of the United States”
as defined in 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) of the Federal Aviation Act and as interpreted by DOT, and neither
Parent nor MergerCo is an “air carrier” within the meaning of the Federal Aviation Act.
SECTION 4.08. Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or commission, in

considered in good faith such binding offer, and shall, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect (it being

Subsidiary’s past and present directors and/or officers that are insured under the Company’s current

(iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements (including retirement and welfare benefits but excluding
any severance benefits, retiree welfare benefits and defined benefit pension plans) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall establish an equity

each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) as service with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be recognized the dollar amount of all co-payments,

A
and (if it so elects) to conduct a consent solicitation with respect to the outstanding 2024 Convertible
Notes (any such offer to purchase, together with any such consent solicitation, a “Debt Offer”). If the
Parent or MergerCo elect to conduct a Debt Offer, Parent shall provide the Company with drafts of the
necessary offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, supplemental indenture or other related documents
in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time
in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its counsel to review
and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents, and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent will reasonably
consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant
tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or, if applicable, effectiveness) of any Debt Offer shall be
expressly conditioned on the consummation of the Merger (which condition shall not be waivable by
Parent and/or MergerCo) and the acceptance for purchase of the 2024 Convertible Notes by Parent or
MergerCo, as applicable, of all validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the holders thereof in
such Debt Offer. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and MergerCo to cause any
such Debt Offer to close concurrently with the consummation of the Merger. If the Parent and/or
MergerCo elect to conduct a Debt Offer, (i) the Debt Offer shall be conducted in compliance with the
2024 Convertible Notes Indenture and applicable Law, including all SEC rules and regulations, and (ii)
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any Debt Offer, at the sole expense of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
consummation of a Debt Offer shall not be a condition to Closing and (ii) neither the Company nor any
of its directors, officers, employees or affiliates shall be obligated to make any recommendation with
respect to any Debt Offer.
(b) Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents as part of any Debt Offer including a consent
solicitation, the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the 2024 Convertible Notes
Indenture in accordance with the 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture, amending the terms and
provisions of the 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture as described in the Debt Offer Documents as
reasonably requested by Parent or MergerCo, which supplemental indenture shall become operative
no earlier than the consummation of such Debt Offer, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the trustee under the 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior
to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company or any of its officers, directors or other Representatives have any obligation to authorize,
adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that is not permitted under applicable Law or
would become operative prior to the Closing Date or the time of acceptance for purchase of the 2024
Convertible Notes by Parent or MergerCo. The Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the execution of the supplemental indentures referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, at the sole expense of Parent. If requested by Parent, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its legal counsel to provide all customary legal opinions required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.15 to the extent such legal opinion relates to the
Company and is required to be delivered prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Company or its legal counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to a Debt Offer
that in the opinion of the Company or its legal counsel does not comply with applicable Laws or the
2024 Convertible Notes Indenture, or an opinion with respect to financing by Parent or MergerCo.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required by the 2024 Convertible
Notes Indenture to be performed by the Company as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be
required in connection with the 2024 Convertible Notes and the delivery to the trustee under the

be delivered to the trustee under the 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture, in each case, in connection
with the Transactions or otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Convertible Notes
Indenture. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any such notice, certificate, opinion, document or instrument, in each case before such document is
provided to such trustee, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent and its counsel.
(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries and its respective Representatives in connection with any Debt Offer and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with their cooperation in the arrangement of the Financing and the provision of
any information used in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries), in each case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a
result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement
by, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives.
(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will, at Parent’s request, take all actions reasonably
requested by Parent and cooperate with Parent in connection with making elections under, amending,
obtaining waivers, and/or unwinding or otherwise settling the Convertible Notes Hedge Options and the
Convertible Notes Warrants, so that the Convertible Notes Hedge Options and the Convertible Notes
Warrants are terminated at or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. At Parent’s
request, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, cooperate with Parent in connection
with, and at Parent’s request, initiate or continue, any discussions or negotiations with the
counterparties to the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or the Convertible Notes Warrants or any of
their respective affiliates or any other person, in each case, to the extent such affiliate or other person
expressly represents the interests of the counterparties to the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or the
Convertible Notes Warrants or is empowered to make any determinations, cancelations, terminations,
exercises, settlements, adjustments or computations under the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or
the Convertible Notes Warrants (any such counterparty, affiliate or person, a “Hedge Counterparty”),
with respect to any determination, adjustment or computation in connection with the Convertible Notes
Hedge Options or the Convertible Notes Warrants, including with respect to any cash amounts or
shares of Company Common Stock that may be receivable, issuable, deliverable or payable by the
Company pursuant to the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or the Convertible Notes Warrants
(including upon termination thereof), provided that no such determination, adjustment or computation,
including with respect to any cash amounts or shares of Company Common Stock that may be
receivable, issuable, deliverable or payable by the Company pursuant to the Convertible Notes Hedge
Options or the Convertible Notes Warrants (including upon termination thereof), shall take effect prior
to the Effective Time. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with any written notices or other
documents received from any Hedge Counterparty with respect to any determination, cancelation,
termination, exercise, settlement, adjustment or computation under, or in connection with any
discussions or negotiations related to, the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or the Convertible Notes
Warrants. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, except as
contemplated herein, enter into any discussions, negotiations or agreements in respect of the
Convertible Notes Hedge Options or the Convertible Notes Warrants or make any elections,
amendments, modifications or other changes to the terms of the Convertible Notes Hedge Options or
the Convertible Notes Warrants, or make any cash payments or share deliveries with respect to the
