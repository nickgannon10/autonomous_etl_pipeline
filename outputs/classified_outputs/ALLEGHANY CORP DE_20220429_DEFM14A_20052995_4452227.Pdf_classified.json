LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of March 20, 2022 and based\nupon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $848.02 in cash per share of the Company\ncommon stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided financial advisory services and its opinion for\nthe information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs\nopinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect\nto the merger or any other matter.\nPursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay\nGoldman Sachs a transaction fee of $27 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger.\nFor additional information, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cOpinion of the Company\u2019s Financial\nAdvisor\u201d beginning on page 29 and Annex B to this proxy statement.\nCertain Effects of the Merger (page 22)\nIf the conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, Merger Sub will\nbe merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company\nwill continue as the surviving corporation, with all of its property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts,\nliabilities and duties continuing unaffected by the merger. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Company\ncommon stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger, other than shares (i) held\nin the treasury of the Company or owned by Berkshire or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire\nor (ii) held by a stockholder who has demanded and perfected such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal rights in\naccordance with Delaware law, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $848.02 in\ncash, without interest. Following completion of the merger, the Company common stock will no longer be publicly\ntraded, and the Company\u2019s existing stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in the Company.\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTreatment of Company Equity Awards (page 48)\nRestricted Stock Units. Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is not subject to any performance-based vesting\nrequirements (each, an \u201cRSU\u201d), other than any Director RSU (as defined below), including any dividend equivalent\nunits credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving\ncorporation an amount equal to the merger consideration and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will\nbe paid in cash to the holder of such RSU within 15 business days of the existing vesting date applicable to such\nRSU if the holder continues employment through the vesting date, subject to full accelerated vesting and payment\nwithin 15 business days (subject to any required delay in payment required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d)) of the earlier termination of the holder\u2019s employment without cause or due to the holder\u2019s\ndeath, total disability or qualified retirement (which for RSUs is defined as retirement on or after attaining age 60 and\n10 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries that is approved by the Company\u2019s chief executive officer\n(or, in the case of the Company\u2019s chief executive officer, approval by Berkshire\u2019s chief executive officer or the\ncompensation committee of Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors) after at least 90 days\u2019 notice from the holder of his or her\nintent to retire (an \u201cRSU Qualified Retirement\u201d)). For any outstanding RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the\nmerger, the RSU consideration will be paid without interest within 15 business days of closing.\nPerformance Shares. Each outstanding restricted stock unit that is subject to any performance-based vesting\nrequirement (each, a \u201cPSU\u201d), other than the Match Award (as defined below), including any dividend equivalent\nunits credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving\ncorporation an amount equal to the merger consideration (assuming maximum level performance was achieved for\npurposes of determining the number of PSUs) and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in\ncash to the holder of such PSU at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the\ncompletion of the applicable performance period if the holder continues employment through the end of such\nperformance period in accordance with the original payment terms of the award, without any ongoing performance-\nvesting conditions, subject to full accelerated vesting upon the earlier termination of the holder\u2019s employment\nwithout cause or due to holder\u2019s death, total disability or qualified retirement (which for PSUs is defined as retirement\non or after attaining age 60 and 10 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries (a \u201cPSU Qualified\nRetirement\u201d)).\nMatch Award. The PSUs granted under the performance share matching award to Joseph P. Brandon, the Company\u2019s\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, on April 1, 2022, as contemplated by Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment agreement\nwith the Company (the \u201cMatch Award\u201d), including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount in cash equal to the\nmerger consideration less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the time specified in the\napplicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr. Brandon continues\nemployment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment terms of the award.\nHowever, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will not be assumed for\npurposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount payable to Mr. Brandon in\nrespect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the \u201cadjusted book value per\ncommon share\u201d performance goal during the Match Award\u2019s five-year performance period ending December 31, 2026\nand the actual number of PSUs earned during the performance period. The merger agreement provides for full\naccelerated vesting of the right to receive the amount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier\ntermination of Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment without cause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified\nRetirement, consistent with the PSUs held by other employees.\nDirector Awards. Each outstanding RSU granted to our non-employee directors under the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 stock\nplans (the \u201cDirector RSUs\u201d), including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount equal to the merger consideration in\ncash at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement or applicable deferral election.\nExcept as specifically noted above, each RSU, PSU and Director RSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate\nfrom the effective time of the merger until the respective payment date.\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 37)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the\nmerger, you should be aware that aside from their interests as stockholders of the Company, some of the Company\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other\nstockholders of the Company generally. Interests of executive officers and directors that may be different from or in\naddition to the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders include:\n\u2022\nThe treatment of equity awards, including assuming maximum level performance for purposes of\ndetermining the number of PSUs held by PSU holders (other than with respect to the Match Award held by\nthe President and Chief Executive Officer), as of the effective time of the merger.\n\u2022\nCertain of the Company\u2019s executive officers may receive a payment or benefit, which would constitute a\n\u201cparachute payment\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in which case, pursuant to the merger\nagreement, the surviving corporation will provide a tax gross up (including with respect to any such gross\nup payments) to such executive officer for any excise taxes imposed under Section 280G of the Code in\nconnection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification coverage under\nthe merger agreement and the Company\u2019s organizational documents.\nThe Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement and\nthe merger, and in recommending to the stockholders of the Company that the merger agreement and the merger be\napproved and adopted. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d and\nsee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for the Merger.\u201d The Company\u2019s stockholders\nshould take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement and the merger. These interests are described in more detail below in the section of the proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d and\ncertain of them are quantified in the disclosure below.\nFinancing (page 37)\nThe Company and Berkshire estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger will be\napproximately $11.6 billion. We understand that Berkshire intends to fund the merger consideration through available\ncash.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 43)\nIf you are a U.S. holder, the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger\nwill generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger\nwill generally not be a taxable transaction to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless you have certain\nconnections to the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax\nconsequences to you of the exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light\nof your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other\ntax laws).\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 45)\nUnder the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until\nnotifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and\nthe Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The\nCompany and Berkshire filed their respective Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust\nDivision and the FTC on April 6, 2022.\nThe merger is also reportable and subject to the approval of antitrust and competition regulators in the following\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions: Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan and South Africa. In addition, foreign filings\nmight be required in a few other non-U.S. jurisdictions which have yet to be determined by the parties.\nInsurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may directly or indirectly acquire control of an\ninsurance company unless and until that acquisition has been approved by the relevant domiciliary or other\ninsurance regulator of that insurance company. Pursuant to those laws and regulations, Berkshire and/or the\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany have filed, or will file, applications for prior approval or prior notifications relating to the various insurance\ncompany subsidiaries of the Company with a number of state insurance regulators in the United States, the\nPrudential Regulation Authority and Lloyd\u2019s of London in the United Kingdom, the Commissariat Aux Assurances in\nLuxembourg, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission in Gibraltar, the Banco Central del Paraguay in Paraguay,\nthe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in Australia, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions\n(and other provincial regulators) in Canada, the Bermuda Monetary Authority in Bermuda and the Financial Services\nAuthority in Japan. Further, pursuant to the insurance laws and regulations of certain U.S. states, Berkshire has\nprovided, or will provide, a prior notification to a number of applicable insurance regulatory authorities regarding the\nlikely impact of the merger on market competition in its state.\nFilings will also be made by Berkshire seeking non-disapproval of the insurance department of the State of Texas\nrelating to the change of control of the Company\u2019s subsidiary that is licensed as an agent in Texas which is not a\nresident of Texas.\nAlthough Berkshire and the Company do not expect the relevant insurance regulatory authorities to raise any\nsignificant concerns in connection with their review of the merger, there is no assurance that Berkshire or the\nCompany, as applicable, will obtain all required insurance regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or that these\napprovals will not include a restriction, limitation or condition which, in such case, would permit Berkshire to refuse\nto close the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and consummate the merger.\nDissenting Shares (page 49)\nUnder Delaware law, holders of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of approval and adoption of the\nmerger agreement and the merger will have the right to seek appraisal and receive the judicially determined \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of their shares of Company common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the merger closes,\nbut only if they perfect their appraisal rights by precisely complying with the required procedures under the\napplicable provisions of Delaware law. A copy of the Delaware statutory provisions related to appraisal rights is\nattached as Annex C to this proxy statement and a summary of these provisions can be found under \u201cAppraisal\nRights.\u201d This appraisal value could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration that would have\notherwise been received for those shares.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (page 46)\nIf the merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). As such, the Company would no longer file\nperiodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) with respect to the Company common\nstock. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cDelisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock.\u201d\nGo-Shop\u037e No Solicitation by the Company (page 54)\nPursuant to the terms of a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the merger agreement, during the period beginning on the date of\nthe merger agreement and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on April 14, 2022 (such period, the \u201cGo-Shop Period\u201d),\nthe Company was permitted to (i) solicit, initiate or facilitate the making of alternative takeover proposals from third\nparties\u037e (ii) provide non-public information to third parties in connection with alternative takeover proposals\u037e and (iii)\nparticipate in discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding alternative takeover proposals. After the Go-\nShop Period, the Company has agreed not to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals relating\nto alternative takeover transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations\nregarding, or provide any non-public information in connection with, alternative takeover proposals. As described\nbelow, the Company has the right to terminate the merger agreement prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of\nthe merger to accept a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d during or following the Go-Shop Period, subject to the terms and\nconditions of the merger agreement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement- Go-\nShop\u037e No Solicitation by the Company.\u201d There is no termination fee payable in the event of any termination of the\nmerger agreement.\nTermination (page 59)\nThe Company and Berkshire may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the\neffective time of the merger.\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, either the Company or Berkshire may terminate the merger agreement if:\n\u2022\nthe merger is not consummated on or before November 21, 2022 (as it may be extended, the \u201coutside date\u201d),\nsubject to automatic extension to not later than March 21, 2023, if all of the conditions to the completion of\nthe Merger other than the receipt of required regulatory approvals have been satisfied or are capable of\nbeing satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\na governmental entity has issued a permanent injunction or similar order which is final and non-appealable\nrestraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, so long as the party seeking to\nterminate has used the efforts required of it under the merger agreement to prevent the entry of the\npermanent injunction or other order\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe required vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the\nmerger is not obtained at the special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements).\nThe Company may also terminate the merger agreement:\n\u2022\nin connection with entering into a definitive agreement related to a superior proposal prior to the receipt of\nthe required vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the\nmerger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, as further described below under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Termination\u037e\u201d or\n\u2022\nif Berkshire or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements\ncontained in the merger agreement, such that the conditions to the Company\u2019s obligations to complete the\nmerger would not be satisfied, and such breach is not cured by the outside date, as further described below\nunder \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination.\u201d\nBerkshire may also terminate the merger agreement:\n\u2022\nin the event of a withdrawal or change of recommendation by the Board or if the Board approves or\nrecommends a takeover proposal\u037e or\n\u2022\nif the Company has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in\nthe merger agreement, such that the conditions to Berkshire\u2019s obligations to complete the merger would not\nbe satisfied, and such breach is not cured by the outside date, as further described below under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Termination.\u201d\nThere are no termination fees payable upon any termination of the merger agreement.\n7\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

You will not be\nentitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Berkshire.\nThe merger consideration represents a multiple of 1.26 times the Company\u2019s book value at December 31, 2021, a\n29% premium to the Company\u2019s average stock price over the 30 days prior to announcement of the merger\nagreement and a 16% premium to the Company\u2019s 52-week high closing stock price prior to the announcement of\nthe merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhere and when is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will take place at The Penn Club, 30 West 44th Street, New York, New York, on June 9, 2022,\nat 10:00 a.m. local time.\nQ:\nWhat matters will be voted on at the special meeting?\nA:\nYou will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be payable to the named\nexecutive officers of the Company in connection with the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the\nproposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote of the Company\u2019s stockholders is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger?\nA:\nStockholders holding at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of\nCompany common stock at the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders\nentitled to vote at the special meeting must vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement and the merger. A failure to vote your shares of Company common stock or an abstention from voting\nwill have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the\nmerger.\n8TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of the close business on April 28, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 13,454,888 shares\nof Company common stock issued and outstanding.\nQ:\nHave any significant stockholders indicated how they intend to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nJefferson W. Kirby, the Chair of our Board of Directors, controls 2.5% of the Company common stock and has\nindicated that he intends to vote those shares \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\nand the merger.\nQ:\nHow many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\nA:\nA quorum will be present if holders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting on the\nclose of business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a\nquorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to\ntime until a quorum is obtained.\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on\nany of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining\nwhether a quorum is present at the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares of Company common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d with your broker, bank or other nominee\nand you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting since all of the proposals currently expected to\nbe voted on at the special meeting are considered non-routine matters.\nQ:\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve other matters to be discussed at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may be payable to the named executive\nofficers of the Company in connection with the merger and the proposal regarding adjournment of the special\nmeeting each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in person or represented\nby proxy at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between a stockholder of record and a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to\nthose shares. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust company or other nominee,\nthen the broker, bank, trust company or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect\nto those shares, while you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares. In the latter case, your shares are\nsaid to be held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d\nQ:\nIf I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote?\nA:\nIf you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank, trust company or\nother nominee (that is, in street name), you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on\nhow to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee. Please note\nthat you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting\nin person at the special meeting. Further, brokers who hold shares of Company common stock on behalf of their\ncustomers may not give a proxy to the Company to vote those shares without specific instructions from their\ncustomers.\nIf you are a Company stockholder who holds shares of Company common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do\nnot instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may not vote your shares, which will have the\nsame effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and,\nassuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the other proposals.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you\nwish to vote on any particular proposal, the Company common stock represented by your proxy will be voted in\nfavor of each of the proposals.\n9\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may become payable to the\nnamed executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies.\nQ:\nWhat are some of the effects the merger will have on the Company?\nA:\nThe Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is traded on the NYSE under\nthe symbol \u201cY.\u201d As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will\nbecome a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire. Following the consummation of the merger, the Company\ncommon stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will\nno longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to the Company common stock, in each\ncase in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement and the merger are not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the merger is not\nconsummated for any other reason, the Company\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares in\nconnection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of the Company\ncommon stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory proposal on executive compensation that may\nbecome payable to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nA:\nThe approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an\nadvisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Berkshire. If the merger agreement and the merger are\napproved by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be\npaid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Company common stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important. If you are\na stockholder of record, you can ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your\nproxy via:\n\u2022\nmail, using the enclosed postage-paid envelope\u037e\n\u2022\ntelephone, by calling the toll-free number listed on each proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet, by accessing the address provided on each proxy card.\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you\nwish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement and the merger, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may become\npayable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and the proposal to\nadjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.\nIf you hold your shares of Company common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee,\nyou should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your\nbroker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted,\nwhich will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\nand the merger.\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company\u2019s Corporate Secretary in writing at\nAlleghany Corporation, 1411 Broadway, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, Attention: Corporate Secretary,\nor by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy\nbeing revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person\n(simply attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the above-\ndescribed options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow the\ninstructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote?\nA:\nThe vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger is based on the total number of shares of\nCompany common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the record date, not just the\nshares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.\nQ:\nWill my shares of Company common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of Company common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by\na different stockholder than any shares of Company common stock you hold of record, any shares of Company\ncommon stock so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of Company common stock you\nhold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Company common stock in various registered forms, such as\njointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign,\ndate and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Company common stock because they are held in a\ndifferent form of record ownership. Shares of Company common stock held by a corporation or business entity\nmust be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of Company common stock held in an individual\nretirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Company common stock before completion of the merger?\nA:\nIf you transfer your shares of Company common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger\nconsideration in the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of\nCompany common stock through completion of the merger.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the consummation of the\nmerger. So, if you transfer your shares of Company common stock after the record date but before the closing of\nthe merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger, but you will\nhave retained the right to vote at the special meeting.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying\nagent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Company common stock\nfor the merger consideration. If your shares of Company common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker,\nbank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,\nif any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger\nconsideration. Do not send in your certificates now.\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the merger consideration for my shares of Company\ncommon stock?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will\ninclude the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an\naffidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. The Company may also require\nthat you post a bond, in such reasonable amount as the surviving corporation may direct, as indemnity against\nany potential loss.\n1\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nAm I entitled to exercise dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my\nshares of Company common stock?\nA:\nYes. Under Delaware law, holders of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of the approval and\nadoption of the merger agreement and the merger will have the right to seek appraisal and receive the judicially\ndetermined \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Company common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if\nthe merger closes, but only if they perfect their appraisal rights by precisely complying with the required\nprocedures under the applicable provisions of Delaware law. This appraisal value could be more than, the same\nas, or less than the merger consideration that would have otherwise been received for those shares.\nTo exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, stockholders must submit a written demand for appraisal to the\nCompany prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, must not\nvote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, and must continue to\nhold the shares of Company common stock of record through the effective time. Failure to comply strictly with\nthe procedures set forth in the applicable provisions of Delaware law will result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nThe text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nWe encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.\nQ:\nWill I have to pay taxes on the merger consideration I receive?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. holder, the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the\nmerger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a non-U.S. holder,\nthe merger will generally not be a taxable transaction to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless you\nhave certain connections to the United States. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the\nparticular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to\nthe merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or\nforeign income and other tax laws).\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of Company common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you\nwill receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or\nvoting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to\nyou) to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of\nthe meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of\nCompany common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Company\ncommon stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your\nbroker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will\narrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You\nmay decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your\nshares or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact MacKenzie\nPartners, Inc., which is acting as the proxy solicitor for the Company in connection with the merger, or the\nCompany.\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc.\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\nToll-free: (800) 322-2885\nproxy@mackenziepartners.com\n\u2002\nor\n\u2002\nAlleghany Corporation\n1411 Broadway, 34th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\nAttention: Investor Relations\n(212) 752-1356\nIf your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you should also call your broker, bank or other nominee for\nadditional information.\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of their ongoing evaluation of the Company\u2019s business, the Board and the Company\u2019s senior management\nperiodically review and assess the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance, total stockholder return, and\nprospects in light of industry conditions and the general economic environment and their potential impact on the\nCompany\u2019s long-term strategic goals and plans, which review and assessment includes potential opportunities for\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions, dispositions and other financial and strategic alternatives. Over the past few\nyears, the Board has evaluated, and senior management has had conversations with third parties regarding, a\ndisposition, spin-off and/or initial public offering of each of the Company\u2019s Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., RSUI Group,\nInc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. businesses.\nOn the evening of March 7, 2022, Mr. Brandon and Warren E. Buffett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of\nBerkshire, met for dinner in New York City. Mr. Brandon, who took office as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer as\nof December 31, 2021 and previously had worked with Mr. Buffett as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of\nBerkshire\u2019s subsidiary General Re Corporation, had sent Mr. Buffett a copy of the annual letter to the Company\u2019s\nstockholders, which accompanied the Company\u2019s annual report, as the Company had done from time to time in prior\nyears. Following receipt of the annual letter from Mr. Brandon, on February 25, 2022, Mr. Buffett suggested that they\nget together in New York or Nebraska.\nAfter some casual conversation at the March 7 dinner meeting, Mr. Buffett conveyed Berkshire\u2019s interest in acquiring\nthe Company for $850 per share of common stock in cash, less any fee payable to the Company\u2019s financial advisor, if\nthe Board were interested in pursuing a transaction. He stated that Berkshire\u2019s offer was not subject to any financing\ncondition or any geopolitical risks and that Berkshire would not need to conduct any due diligence. Mr. Buffett\nindicated that if the Board were interested in pursuing a transaction at that price, Berkshire\u2019s offer would be subject\nto both parties moving quickly to negotiate and announce a transaction. Mr. Buffett indicated that Berkshire would\nbe willing to agree to a \u201cgo-shop\u201d pursuant to which the Company would be able to solicit alternative proposals\nfollowing execution of a merger agreement with Berkshire. Mr. Brandon said that he would convey Mr. Buffett\u2019s offer\nto the Board, and would let him know if it were interested in pursuing a potential transaction.\nLater on the evening of March 7, Mr. Brandon informed Jefferson W. Kirby, the Chair of the Board, and Christopher\nK. Dalrymple, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, of Berkshire\u2019s proposal. Mr.\nKirby and Mr. Brandon agreed to call a special meeting of the Board to convey the offer and determine whether to\nproceed with further discussions.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with members of senior management and representatives of\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher LLP (\u201cWillkie\u201d), outside legal counsel to the Company. Mr. Brandon provided a\n22TABLE OF CONTENTS\nsummary of his discussion with Mr. Buffett and described the terms of Berkshire\u2019s offer. Representatives of Willkie\nand Mr. Dalrymple reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with considering a potential sale of the\nCompany. The Board determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company to engage in discussions with\nBerkshire about a potential sale of the Company. Accordingly, the Board authorized Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon to\nengage in discussions with representatives of Berkshire about a potential transaction. In light of potential conflicts of\ninterest of the Company\u2019s employees that may arise in connection with a sale of the Company, the Board directed that\nany negotiations with Mr. Buffett or other representatives of Berkshire should include Mr. Kirby. The Board\ndiscussed engaging a financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction to provide advice, render a\nfairness opinion in the event a transaction were agreed to and advise on and coordinate the outreach to potential\nacquirors during the potential \u201cgo-shop\u201d process. The Board discussed the merits of engaging Goldman Sachs\nversus other financial advisors in light of the Berkshire proposal that explicitly deducted the financial advisory fee\n(on a per share basis) from the price per share to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Board considered\nthat Goldman Sachs has extensive knowledge of the industries in which the Company operates and significant\nexperience advising companies similar to the Company in connection with potential strategic transactions, and had\npreviously advised the Company in connection with the evaluation of several strategic transactions and thus knew\nthe Company well and was well known to the Company and its management, which would allow Goldman Sachs to\nmeet the anticipated timeline without sacrificing thoroughness. The Board discussed the desire for confidentiality\nand the possibility of public disclosure if multiple potential investment banks were contacted. The Board determined\nthat in light of the foregoing factors, Mr. Brandon should contact Goldman Sachs to discuss its potential engagement\nand its fee.\nIn an executive session of the non-employee directors, the Board again discussed potential conflicts of interest\narising out of a sale of the Company, including in connection with any amounts that would be payable to\nmanagement as a result of a sale transaction and any future employment of management with the potential buyer,\ntaking into account that Mr. Brandon had previously worked with Mr. Buffett as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nof Berkshire\u2019s subsidiary General Re Corporation. The non-employee directors reiterated that in light of these\npotential conflicts, there should be no discussions with Berkshire regarding management\u2019s possible post-closing\nemployment with the potential buyer or any amounts payable to management as a result of a transaction until after\nthe price per share and other material terms of any transaction had been agreed upon, and that Mr. Kirby should\nparticipate in any price negotiations going forward if and when they occurred.\nOn March 10, 2022, Mr. Brandon and Mr. Dalrymple communicated to Mr. Buffett the Board\u2019s willingness for the\nCompany to pursue discussions regarding a potential transaction with Berkshire. They agreed that the next step\nwould be for Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon to meet with Mr. Buffett in Nebraska. Later that day, the Company and\nBerkshire executed a confidentiality agreement which contained a customary standstill provision.\nOn March 12, 2022, Mr. Kirby and Mr. Brandon met with Mr. Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska. Mr. Buffett confirmed the\nterms of his original offer and underscored Berkshire\u2019s ability to provide closing certainty, reiterating that the offer\nwas not subject to any due diligence nor would the closing be contingent upon Berkshire obtaining third-party\nfinancing. Mr. Brandon left the meeting and Mr. Kirby then met with Mr. Buffett one-on-one. Mr. Kirby asked Mr.\nBuffett to increase the price by increasing the $850 price per share or potentially by eliminating the deduction to the\nmerger consideration for the fee payable to the financial advisor. Mr. Kirby also asked Mr. Buffett if he would\nconsider using Berkshire\u2019s stock as a portion of the deal consideration. Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original\noffer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points.\nOn March 13, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with members of senior management and Willkie. Mr. Kirby\nand Mr. Brandon provided an update on their March 12 meeting with Mr. Buffett. Representatives from Willkie\nprovided an overview of a potential transaction timeline, including the Company\u2019s ability to solicit alternative\nproposals after signing during the Go-Shop Period, to receive unsolicited proposals during the subsequent \u201cno-\nshop\u201d period up until the date of the special meeting of stockholders, and the process to obtain required regulatory\napprovals. Willkie reviewed and the Board discussed its fiduciary duties. At the Board\u2019s request, representatives of\nGoldman Sachs reviewed Mr. Buffett\u2019s offer relative to the Company\u2019s historical and projected performance and its\nvaluation (using several customary financial metrics), led a discussion about the insurance industry and general\nM&A trends, ongoing inflation concerns and uncertain geopolitical conditions, and discussed a number of strategic\nalternatives including remaining as a stand-alone public company. Goldman Sachs also reviewed other potential\nacquirors of the Company and sale process alternatives. Goldman\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSachs then left the meeting and the Board authorized continued discussions about a potential transaction with\nBerkshire and the engagement of Goldman Sachs as financial advisor for a fee of $27 million (representing $1.98 per\nshare of Company common stock, or 0.23% of the $850 per share price), understanding that the financial advisory fee\nwould be deducted from the per share price and that Goldman Sachs\u2019 role in advising the Board would be\ninstrumental in ensuring a full and fair process consistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties, including soliciting\nalternative proposals following the announcement of any transaction with Berkshire in search of the highest price\nreasonably available. Representatives from Willkie reviewed information regarding certain relationships that Goldman\nSachs had with Berkshire and its affiliates, as more fully described on page 29. After participating in a private session\nwith the Board, Mr. Brandon was excused, following which the Board and representatives from Willkie discussed in\nan executive session the transaction and the timeline to potentially execute the merger agreement and to consummate\na merger transaction.\nLater on the evening of March 13, 2022, the Company executed an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs.\nOn March 14, 2022, Munger, Tolles and Olson LLP, outside legal counsel to Berkshire (\u201cMunger\u201d), and Willkie\ndiscussed drafting responsibilities among the lawyers and the anticipated timeline to execute a merger agreement.\nThat afternoon, Munger sent Willkie an initial draft of the merger agreement that, among other things, included a 25-\nday \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, with a right for Berkshire to match any superior proposal with five business days\u2019 notice,\nbut no termination fee would be payable by the Company if, prior to the approval of the merger agreement by the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders, the Company were to terminate the agreement in favor of a superior proposal either during\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d period or thereafter. The draft merger agreement also proposed an outside date six months after the\nsigning date, with the option to extend such date for 60 days to obtain any required regulatory approvals not\nreceived as of the outside date. The treatment of outstanding Company equity awards was not addressed in the draft.\nLater on March 14, 2022, senior management and Mr. Kirby informed Mr. Buffett and Marc D. Hamburg, Chief\nFinancial Officer, Secretary and Senior Vice President of Berkshire, that the Company had engaged Goldman Sachs,\nand had agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a financial advisory fee if a transaction were consummated of $27 million,\nwhich is the equivalent of $1.98 per share of Company common stock.\nOn March 15, 2022, representatives of Willkie and Munger discussed Munger\u2019s initial draft of the merger agreement,\nparticularly the deduction from the purchase price of the financial advisory fee, the 25-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, the five\nbusiness day match right for Berkshire subsequent to a superior offer, the lack of a termination fee payable to\nBerkshire in the event there is a superior offer and the agreement is terminated, the terms of the regulatory approval\nprovisions and the lack of a reverse termination fee in the event regulatory approval is not obtained, and the outside\ndate of six months after signing with one 60-day extension to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOn March 16, 2022, Willkie sent Munger a revised draft of the merger agreement. Willkie\u2019s draft included a \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nperiod of 35 days and eliminated Berkshire\u2019s matching right. The draft also included an outside date of eight months\nafter signing with two automatic 60-day extensions, revisions to the regulatory approval provisions and a reverse\ntermination fee that would be payable by Berkshire to the Company if the Company were to terminate the merger\nagreement due to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals prior to the outside date.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Board met by videoconference with senior management and representatives from Willkie and\nGoldman Sachs. Willkie reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in the context of considering a potential sale of the\nCompany and summarized the material terms of the merger agreement, including unresolved points relating to the\nlength of the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period and inclusion of a match right, the absence of a reverse termination fee due to\nregulatory approval failure, and the outside date and any permitted extension for regulatory approval. Willkie noted\nthat Berkshire did not propose that the Company pay a termination fee if the Company were to terminate the merger\nagreement in order to accept a superior proposal from another acquiror, whether the superior proposal came during\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d period or thereafter during the \u201cno-shop\u201d period up until the actual date of the special meeting of\nstockholders to approve the sale of the Company. The Board discussed that the absence of a termination fee was\nhighly unusual and favorable to the Company because termination fees made it more expensive for alternative\nacquirors to acquire a company and could discourage bidders from submitting proposals during a \u201cgo-shop\u201d period\nor thereafter during the \u201cno-shop\u201d period. Willkie discussed the lack of a reverse termination fee that would be\npayable by Berkshire to the Company if antitrust or other regulatory approvals were not received.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRepresentatives from Goldman Sachs reviewed potential alternatives that could be available to the Company as an\nalternative to the status quo or a transaction with Berkshire, including the potential sale or spin-out of one or more of\nthe Company\u2019s business units, and each alternative\u2019s potential value, execution risk and associated timing\nconsiderations and costs. The Board considered the merits and risks of contacting other potential acquirors prior to\nsigning, including the risk that Berkshire, in light of Mr. Buffett\u2019s past statements that Berkshire avoids auction\nprocesses and Berkshire\u2019s track record of not participating in auctions, would withdraw its proposal, and the risk of a\nleak from such outreach and the impact of such a leak on the process for signing of a definitive agreement. After this\ndiscussion, the Board decided that the potential benefit of contacting other potential acquirors prior to signing was\noutweighed by the risks and that relying on the Company\u2019s ability to solicit and consider superior proposals from an\nalternative acquiror after the announcement of a transaction with Berkshire without the prospect of having to pay\nBerkshire a termination fee if the Company were to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal\nwould be the appropriate strategy to pursue in the Company\u2019s circumstances. In an executive session attended by\nthe non-employee directors and representatives of Willkie, the Board discussed a memorandum prepared by senior\nmanagement outlining a proposal for the treatment of outstanding Company equity awards upon the closing of the\nmerger, and authorized senior management to communicate the proposal to Berkshire.\nOn March 17, 2022, Munger sent Willkie a revised draft of the merger agreement and thereafter Willkie and Munger\nfinalized the open points of the transaction. After discussion and negotiation, the draft merger agreement provided\nfor a 25-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period with two business days\u2019 notice, no termination fees would be payable upon\ntermination of the merger agreement and an outside date of eight months after the signing date with two automatic\n60-day extensions thereof to obtain any regulatory approvals not received as of the outside date.\nOn March 18, 2022, senior management and Mr. Kirby communicated to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Hamburg the Board-\nauthorized proposal for the treatment of outstanding Company equity awards upon the closing of the merger. The\nproposal provided that (i) each outstanding RSU (other than Director RSUs) would be valued at the merger\nconsideration and paid out in cash on the existing vesting schedule following the closing, (ii) each outstanding PSU\n(other than the Match Award) would be valued at the merger consideration (assuming maximum level of performance\nwas achieved) and paid to holders following the completion of the applicable performance period, (iii) each\noutstanding PSU under the Match Award held by Mr. Brandon would be subject to the same treatment as other PSUs\nexcept that in lieu of assuming maximum level performance, the amount of cash payable in respect of the Match\nAward would be determined based on actual attainment of the applicable performance goal during the applicable\nperformance period, and (iv) each outstanding Director RSU of the Company would be valued at the merger\nconsideration and paid to the holders at the same time as specified in the applicable plan and award agreement.\nSubsequently, Berkshire agreed with the material terms of this proposal, and Willkie and Munger reflected the terms\nin the merger agreement.\nOn March 20, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference attended by the Company\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Goldman Sachs and Willkie. Representatives of Willkie reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties\nand other legal matters in connection with the Board\u2019s consideration of the proposed merger agreement, and\nreviewed with the Board the terms of the proposed merger agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then\nreviewed and discussed its financial analyses with respect to the Company and the proposed merger. Thereafter, at\nthe request of the Board, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Board (which was subsequently confirmed\nin writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion dated the same date) as to, as of March 20, 2022, the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company common stock, other than Berkshire and its\naffiliates, of the merger consideration to be received by such stockholders in the merger pursuant to the merger\nagreement.\nThe Board considered the benefits and costs to stockholders of capturing and monetizing the value of the business\nthrough Berkshire\u2019s all-cash proposal, versus the risks and opportunities of continuing on a stand-alone basis or\nsoliciting proposals for various divestiture alternatives such as the sale or spin out of one or more of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness units. The Board considered the terms of the merger agreement that would allow the Company to solicit and\nentertain third-party proposals following the execution and announcement of the merger agreement, without the\nprospect of having to pay a termination fee if the Board were to pursue an alternative proposal that was superior to\nthe merger with Berkshire, no matter when the superior proposal was received prior\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto the special meeting of stockholders to approve the sale of the Company. After discussion, the Board concluded\nthat it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to secure the benefits of the proposed\ntransaction with Berkshire, while retaining the ability to pursue and accept a superior proposal following\nannouncement of a transaction with Berkshire.\nThe Board unanimously approved the merger agreement as being in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders, and unanimously authorized the execution and delivery of the merger agreement.\nThat evening, the Company and Berkshire executed the merger agreement.\nOn the morning of March 21, 2022, prior to the commencement of trading on the NYSE, the Company and Berkshire\nissued a joint press release announcing the transaction and their execution of a definitive merger agreement.\nOn or about March 21, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs began the \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nprocess. During the \u201cgo-shop\u201d process, 23 potential strategic bidders and 8 potential financial sponsor bidders were\ncontacted about their potential interest in submitting a proposal for a transaction with the Company that would be\nsuperior to the one contemplated in the merger agreement with Berkshire. Despite these efforts, at the expiration of\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d process, the Company did not receive any alternative acquisition proposals.",

considered\na variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, each of which the directors\nbelieved supported their decision, including the following material factors:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the Company common stock, including the market performance of\nthe Company common stock relative to general market indices and to other property and casualty\nreinsurance and insurance companies, in particular in light of the fact that the Company\u2019s reinsurance and\ninsurance subsidiaries constituted 84.3% of its stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2021, and that the\n$848.02 per share price to be paid in cash in respect of each share of Company common stock, which\nrepresented a premium of 25.3% over the closing price of the Company common stock on March 18, 2022\n(the last trading day prior to the Board\u2019s approval of the merger agreement), a premium of 29% over the\nvolume-weighted average

the Company, as described more fully below in\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes\nthe material factors considered by the Board. The Board collectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger\nagreement and deem the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company, in light of the various factors described above\nand other factors that the members of the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of factors\nconsidered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the\nBoard did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nspecific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to\nwhether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate\ndetermination of the Board. Rather, the Board made its recommendation based on the totality of the information\navailable to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the Company\u2019s management and the financial\nand legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have given\ndifferent weights to different factors.\nThis explanation of the Board\u2019s reasons for recommending the approval of the merger agreement and other\ninformation presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the\nfactors described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d beginning on page 14.\nRecommendation of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors\nAfter careful consideration, the Board has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement, the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.",

In that\nregard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company\u2019s consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs\ndid not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative\nor other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was\nnot furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and\napprovals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected\nbenefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the merger will be\nconsummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or\ncondition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger\nor the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company\u037e\nnor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Prior to the entry into the merger agreement,\nGoldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an\nacquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $848.02\nin cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire and its affiliates) of the\noutstanding shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not\nexpress any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any\nterm or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or\namended in connection with the merger, including, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in\nconnection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the\nCompany\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether\nrelative to the $848.02 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Berkshire\nand its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any\nopinion as to the prices at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential\neffects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Berkshire or the merger, or as to the\nimpact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company, Berkshire or Merger Sub, or the ability of the\nCompany, Berkshire or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\nwas approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described\nrepresent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise\nnoted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as\nit existed on or before March 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date that Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion\nto the Board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nAnalysis of Implied Premiums\nGoldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for Company common stock for the one-year period ending\nMarch 18, 2022. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of the outstanding\nshares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to:\n\u2022\n$676.75, the closing price of the shares of Company common stock on March 18, 2022 (which we refer to as\nthe \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$610.84, the closing price of the shares of Company common stock on March 7, 2022, the date on which the\nCompany received an acquisition proposal from Berkshire (which we refer to as the \u201cDate of Berkshire Offer\nShare Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$821.58, the all-time highest closing price of the shares of Company common stock, as adjusted for special\ndividends paid by the Company (which we refer to as the \u201cAdjusted All-time High Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$729.80, the highest closing trading price per share of Company common stock for the 52-week period\n\u2022\n$729.80, the highest closing trading price per share of Company common stock for the 52-week period\nended March 18, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week High Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$598.73, the lowest closing trading price per share of Company common stock for the 52-week period ended\nMarch 18, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week Low Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$656.92, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as the \u201cVWAP\u201d) of the shares of Company\ncommon stock over the 30-day period ended March 18, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201c30-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$663.01, the VWAP of the shares of Company common stock over the 90-day period ended March 18, 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201c90-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$663.31, the VWAP of the shares of Company common stock over the 180-day period ended March 18, 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201c180-Day VWAP\u201d).\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share of Company common stock to be paid to the Company stockholders\npursuant to the merger agreement represented:\nImplied Premium \nRepresented by\n$848.02 \nPer Share of\nCompany \nCommon Stock\nMerger \nConsideration\nReference Price Per Share of Company common stock:\nCurrent Share Price of $676.75\n25.3%\nDate of Berkshire Offer Share Price of $610.84\n38.8%\nAdjusted All-time High Share Price of $821.58\n3.2%\n52-Week High Price of $729.80\n16.2%\n52-Week Low Price of $598.73\n41.6%\n30-Day VWAP of $656.92\n29.1%\n90-Day VWAP of $663.01\n27.9%\n180-Day VWAP of $663.31\n27.8%\nIllustrative Dividend Discount Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative dividend discount analysis on the Company to derive a\nrange of illustrative values per share for the Company\u2019s fully diluted shares of Company common stock. Goldman\nSachs discounted the estimated capital return to shareholders (in the form of dividend streams and share\nrepurchases) from the Company for the period 2022 through 2024 as reflected in the Forecasts, which contemplate\nonly share repurchases and no dividends, and the range of terminal values to derive present values, as of December\n31, 2021, for the Company. Goldman Sachs calculated a range of terminal values for the Company by applying P/BV\nmultiples ranging from 0.90x to 1.20x to the projected book value per share (including accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d)) of the Company in 2024 as reflected in the Forecasts. These illustrative P/BV\nmultiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into\naccount, among other things, the current and historical observed P/BV multiples for the Company. Goldman Sachs\nused a range of discount rates from 9.2% to 10.4%, reflecting estimates of the Company\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman\nSachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the U.S. financial\nmarkets generally. This analysis implied a value of $599 to $807 per share of Company common stock (rounded to the\nnearest $1.00) as of December 31, 2021 (based on fully diluted shares of Company common stock outstanding as of\nMarch 18, 2022, as provided by the Company\u2019s management).\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share\nof Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future\nvalue of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs\nused the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated and implied a range of\ntheoretical future values per share of Company common stock as of December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2024,\nby applying illustrative P/BV multiples ranging from 0.90x to 1.20x to the Company\u2019s projected book value per share\nof Company common stock (including AOCI) as of December 31 of each such year, per the Forecasts. These\nillustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into\naccount current and historical observed P/BV multiples for the Company. Goldman Sachs then discounted to present\nvalue as of December 31, 2021 both the range of theoretical future values per share it derived for the Company and\nthe estimated dividends to be paid per share of Company common stock through the end of the applicable period as\nreflected in the Forecasts using a discount rate of 9.8%, reflecting an estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity.\nGoldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the capital asset pricing model, which\nrequires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nU.S. financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $567 to $791 per share\nof Company common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00).\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Precedent Transaction Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced\nsince 2014 involving target companies in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry.\nFor each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared: (i) the equity value of each\ntransaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s book value (including AOCI) as reported or calculated using\npublicly available financial information for the most recent financial period reporting date prior to the announcement\n(\u201cP/BV multiples\u201d) of the applicable transaction. While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are\ndirectly comparable to the Company and none of the selected transactions are directly comparable to the merger, the\ntarget companies in the selected transactions are companies with certain operations that, for the purposes of\nanalysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nP/BV \nMultiple\nOctober 28, 2021\nCov\u00e9a Mutual Group Insurance Company\nPartnerRe Ltd.\n1.28x\nOctober 29, 2018\nRenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.\nTokio Millennium Re AG\n1.02x\nAugust 28, 2018\nApollo Global Management, LLC\nAspen Insurance Holdings Limited\n1.12x\nMarch 5, 2018\nAXA SA\nXL Group Ltd\n1.51x\nJanuary 22, 2018\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\nValidus Holdings, Ltd.\n1.57x\nDecember 18, 2016\nFairfax Financial Holdings Limited\nAllied World Assurance Company\nHoldings, AG\n1.35x\nOctober 5, 2016\nSOMPO Holdings, Inc\nEndurance Specialty Holdings Ltd.\n1.36x\nApril 14, 2015\nExor SpA\nPartnerRe Ltd.\n1.10x\nJuly 27, 2015\nChina Minsheng International Holding Pte.\nLtd.\nSirius International Insurance\nGroup, Ltd.\nN/A\nMarch 31, 2015\nEndurance Specialty Holdings Ltd.\nMontpelier Re Holdings Ltd.\n1.21x\nNovember 24, 2014\nRenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.\nPlatinum Underwriters Holdings,\nLtd.\n1.13x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations of P/BV multiples and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of price to book value (including AOCI) multiples of 1.12x to\n1.36x (representing the 25th and 75th percentile premium, respectively, of the implied price to book value multiples\ncalculated for the transactions as described above) to the Company\u2019s December 31, 2021 fully diluted book value\n(including AOCI) per share of Company common stock of approximately $673.39 (based on fully diluted shares of\nCompany common stock outstanding as of March 18, 2022, as provided by the Company\u2019s management) to derive a\nrange of implied values per share of Company common stock of $756 to $914 (rounded to the nearest $1.00).\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash\nacquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2017 through March 18, 2022 involving\ntargets that were public companies based in the U.S. in which the disclosed enterprise values for the transactions\nwere greater than $1.0 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated\nthe median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the premia paid in the 231 acquisitions announced during such\nperiod relative to the target\u2019s closing stock price one day prior to the original announcement date of the transaction.\nThis analysis indicated (i) a median premium of approximately 29.5%, (ii) a 25th percentile premium of approximately\n16.5% and (iii) a 75th percentile premium of approximately 53.0% across the period. Using this analysis and its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 16.5% to\n53.0% to the closing price per share on March 18, 2022 of $676.75 and calculated a range of implied values per Share\nof $788 to $1,035 (rounded to the nearest $1.00).\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or\nBerkshire or the merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than Berkshire and its\naffiliates) of the outstanding shares of Company common stock of the $848.02 in cash per share of Company common\nstock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals\nnor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based\nupon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly\nmore or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to\nuncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective\nadvisors, none of the Company, Berkshire, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future\nresults are materially different from those forecasts.\nThe consideration of $848.02 in cash per share of Company common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between the Company and Berkshire and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice\nto the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only\nappropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the\nBoard in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in\nwhich they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold\nor vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Berkshire, any of their respective affiliates and third\nparties, including affiliates of Warren Buffett, a significant shareholder of Berkshire (the \u201cSignificant Shareholder\u201d) or\nany currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman\nSachs acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and has participated in certain of the\nnegotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting\nservices to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Goldman Sachs Investment Banking\nDivision has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a book runner with respect to a\npublic offering of the Company\u2019s 3.25% senior unsecured notes due August 2051 (aggregate principal amount\n$500,000,000) in July 2021\u037e and as a book runner with respect to a public offering of the Company\u2019s 3.625% senior\nunsecured notes due May 2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in May 2020. During the two-year period\nended March 20, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has also been engaged by Berkshire or its\naffiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized\ncompensation, including having acted as a book runner with respect to a public offering by Burlington Northern\nSanta Fe Corporation, a subsidiary of Berkshire, of its investment grade bonds due in 2051 (aggregate principal\namount $925,000,000) in March 2021\u037e as a book runner with respect to a public offering of Berkshire\u2019s JPY-\ndenominated senior notes (aggregate principal amount $2,316,000,000) in April 2020\u037e and as a book runner with\nrespect to a public offering of Burlington Northern\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSanta Fe Corporation\u2019s investment grade bonds (aggregate principal amount $575,000,000) in April 2020. Goldman\nSachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Berkshire, the\nSignificant Shareholder and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division may\nreceive compensation.\nThe Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment\nbanking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to an engagement letter,\ndated March 13, 2022, as amended, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection\nwith the merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of\n$27 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to\nindemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against certain liabilities that may arise out of Goldman Sachs\u2019\nengagement.",

The PSUs granted to Mr. Brandon under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units\ncredited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an\namount in cash equal to the merger consideration less any required withholding taxes, payable to Mr. Brandon at the\ntime specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.\nBrandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment\nterms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will\nnot be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount\npayable to Mr. Brandon in respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the\n\u201cadjusted book value per common share\u201d performance goal during the Match Award\u2019s five-year performance period\nending December 31, 2026 and the actual number of\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPSUs earned during the performance period. The merger agreement provides for full accelerated vesting of the right\nto receive the amount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier termination of Mr. Brandon\u2019s\nemployment without cause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement, consistent with the PSUs\nheld by other employees. The number of shares subject to the PSUs under Mr. Brandon\u2019s Match Award are 11,457\nassuming target level performance and 22,914 assuming maximum level performance.\nIn addition, similar \u201cat risk\u201d treatment may apply to other PSUs held by Mr. Brandon to the extent necessary to\neliminate or reduce exposure to Mr. Brandon under Section 280G of the Code, as agreed to by the Company, which\ncould result in a reduced payout to Mr. Brandon in respect of his other PSUs depending on the actual attainment of\nthe performance goals during the applicable performance period.\nDirector Awards. Each outstanding Director RSU, including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect thereto,\nwill be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation the merger consideration in\ncash at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement or applicable deferral election. In addition, the\nequity awards made to our non-employee directors on the business day following our 2021 annual meeting of\nstockholders pursuant to the Company\u2019s 2015 Directors\u2019 Stock Plan will vest as of April 30, 2022.\nEach RSU (except for any RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the merger), PSU and Director RSU will be\ncredited with interest at the prime rate from the effective time of the merger until the respective payment date.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The Company\u2019s Officers and Highly Compensated Employees Nonqualified Deferred\nCompensation Plan (the \u201cDCP\u201d) provides for unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements for the\nbenefit of officers and highly compensated employees of the Company and certain subsidiaries. Under the DCP, the\nCompany may make contributions to a participant\u2019s plan account and participants may elect to defer all or a portion\nof their base salary or non-equity incentive compensation under the plan. A participant may elect to have amounts\nunder the plan either credited with interest at the prime rate (\u201cnotional prime rate election\u201d), treated as though\ninvested in the Company\u2019s common stock (\u201ccommon stock election\u201d), or increased or decreased by an amount\nproportionate to the growth or decline in the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity per share (\u201cstockholders equity\nelection\u201d). The merger agreement provides that any amounts for which a \u201ccommon stock election\u201d or a \u201cstockholders\nequity election\u201d is in effect under the DCP will be deemed reinvested into the \u201cnotional prime rate election\u201d\nalternative thereunder. After the closing of the merger, no further \u201ccommon stock elections\u201d or \u201cstockholders equity\nelections\u201d will be permitted under the DCP.\nQuantification of Payments. For an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers in respect of their equity awards in connection with the merger, see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below.\nWe estimate that the aggregate amount that would be realized by the Company\u2019s eight non-employee directors in\nrespect of their equity-based awards is $15,985,805.\nCEO Employment Agreement\nMr. Brandon\u2019s employment agreement provides that, in the event of a termination of his employment by the Company\nwithout cause (other than due to death or total disability), subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of\nthe Company and its affiliates, he will be entitled to continued payment of his base salary until such payments\naggregate $1,050,000 on a gross basis, as severance. Such severance payments shall be conditioned on Mr.\nBrandon\u2019s compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including a confidentiality provision, an invention\nassignment provision and one-year post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. Mr. Brandon\u2019s\nseverance payments would be payable over time following a qualifying termination of employment without regard to\nthe consummation of the merger and are not enhanced by reason of the merger or a termination of employment\nfollowing the merger.\nFor an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Mr.\nBrandon, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the\nCompany\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below.\nMatch Award\nPursuant to Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment agreement, he is entitled to receive a matching PSU award covering the first\n$7.5 million worth of shares of Company common stock (assuming target level performance) that he purchased during\nthe period between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022 and shares of Company common\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstock that he notionally invested into his account under the DCP as of April 1, 2022. Between October 1, 2021 and\nMarch 4, 2022, Mr. Brandon purchased 9,085 shares of Company common stock on the open market and, pursuant to\nthe terms of the DCP and his Match Award agreement, his account under the DCP was notionally invested on March\n1, 2022 into another 2,386.9279 shares of Company common stock, which shares became subject to the Match Award\nagreement.\nThe award agreement for Mr. Brandon\u2019s Match Award provides that PSUs will be earned based on the Company\u2019s\n\u201cAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share\u201d (as defined in the award agreement) achievement during the five year\nperiod commencing January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2026. 200% of the target PSUs will be earned for\nAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement of 10% or more, 100% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value\nPer Common Share achievement of 7%, 50% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement\nof 4% and 0% will be earned for Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share achievement of less than 4%, with straight-\nline interpolation used to calculate the earned amount if achievement is between the percentages above.\nPursuant to the Match Award agreement, to earn the PSUs under the Match Award, Mr. Brandon would be required\nto remain in continued employment with the Company through the end of the performance period, except that, if his\nemployment terminates on or after December 31, 2024 (i) by the Company without \u201cCause\u201d (as defined in Mr.\nBrandon\u2019s employment agreement), or (ii) due to his death, total disability or retirement (which is defined in Mr.\nBrandon\u2019s Match Award agreement as his retirement from the Company that occurs after he has attained age 65 and\nhas completed 12 years of service, provided that he has not engaged in conduct that constitutes \u201cCause\u201d prior to his\nretirement), Mr. Brandon would be entitled to pro-rata vesting of his matching PSUs based on the Company\u2019s\n\u201cAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share\u201d achievement during the performance period as of the December 31st\nimmediately preceding his termination date or, if his employment terminates on December 31st, as of such date.\nUnder the merger agreement, each outstanding PSU under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units\ncredited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an\namount equal to the merger consideration, less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the\ntime specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.\nBrandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment\nterms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will\nnot be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award. Instead, the amount\npayable to Mr. Brandon in respect of the Match Award will be determined based on the actual attainment of the\n\u201cadjusted book value per common share\u201d performance goal during the Match Award\u2019s five-year performance period\nending December 31, 2026. The merger agreement provides for full accelerated vesting of the right to receive the\namount payable in respect of the Match Award upon the earlier termination of Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment without\ncause or due to his death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement, consistent with the PSUs held by other\nemployees.\nMr. Brandon\u2019s award agreement also provides that he must maintain unencumbered beneficial ownership of the\npurchased shares and notional shares credited under the DCP on which matching PSUs were granted and shares of\nthe Company\u2019s common stock he owned as of the date of grant of the Match Award, which covered a total of\n34,325.9279 shares of Company common stock (collectively, the \u201cVested Securities\u201d), throughout the five-year\nperformance period in order to receive the full amount of matching PSUs. However, pursuant to the merger agreement,\nshares of common stock owned by Mr. Brandon that are treated as Vested Securities will be converted into the right\nto receive an amount in cash based on the per share merger consideration, and notional shares of common stock\ncredited to Mr. Brandon under the DCP that are treated as Vested Securities will be deemed to be reinvested into the\n\u201cnotional prime rate election\u201d alternative under the DCP. As a result, after the merger, Mr. Brandon will no longer hold\nany Vested Securities and, consequently, the foregoing restriction on transferring Vested Securities will cease to\napply.\nInterim Period Director Cash Compensation\nIn connection with the merger agreement, commencing effective May 1, 2022, the non-employee directors will be paid\na fixed monthly cash retainer for their continued service on the Board until the closing of the merger consisting of: (i)\n$12,500 per month, which is being paid in lieu of the grant of an annual equity award in respect of 2022\u037e (ii) $8,333.33\n(or, for Mr. Kirby, $17,500) per month, which is being paid in lieu of the annual\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncash retainer for Board service that non-employee directors are otherwise entitled to receive\u037e and (iii) the amount of\nannual cash payments that non-employee directors are otherwise entitled to receive for committee service, paid pro\nrata on a monthly basis until the closing of the merger.\nThe non-employee directors were granted annual equity awards on the business day following the 2021 annual\nmeeting of stockholders, which are scheduled to vest at the next annual meeting of stockholders, which was expected\nto occur in April 2022. The 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is not expected to be held in April 2022. As a result,\nin connection with the merger agreement, the Company agreed to cause the 2021 annual equity awards granted to the\nCompany\u2019s non-employee directors to vest on April 30, 2022.\nPost-Closing Severance\nIn accordance with the disclosure letter to the merger agreement, Berkshire will cause the surviving corporation to\nprovide severance to any employee, including any executive officer, who is terminated without cause by Berkshire or\nits subsidiaries within one year following the effective time of the merger, equal to one year\u2019s salary and target annual\nbonus (or, for John F. Shannon, the Company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, his maximum\nannual bonus), plus full COBRA premium subsidy for such period, subject to such employee\u2019s execution of an\neffective general release of claims in favor of the surviving corporation and its affiliates (the \u201cPost-Closing Severance\nProgram\u201d).\nFor an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to each\nof the Company\u2019s named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Quantification of\nPayments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below.\nSection 280G Tax Gross Up Payments and Mitigation\nIf any payment or benefit to Kerry J. Jacobs, the Company\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, or\nMr. Shannon results in the payment of a \u201cparachute payment\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (as\ndefined below), Berkshire and the Company have agreed that the surviving corporation will provide a tax gross up\n(including with respect to any such gross up payments) to such executive officer for any excise taxes imposed under\nSection 280G of the Code in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including by\nreason of a termination of employment in connection therewith (and the severance payable in respect thereto). No\nother named executive officers are entitled to a Section 280G tax gross up.\nIf and to the extent necessary or appropriate to mitigate or eliminate the imposition of excise taxes under Section 280G\non Mr. Brandon, the Company may agree to make PSU awards held by Mr. Brandon subject to similar \u201cat-risk\u201d\ntreatment as the Match Award, whereby the amount of the cash payment for the PSU award will be based on the\nactual attainment of the \u201cadjusted book value per common share\u201d performance goal during the applicable\nperformance period.\nFor an estimate of the value of the tax gross-up payments described above that would be payable to Ms. Jacobs or\nMr. Shannon, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the\nCompany\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below.\nIndemnification\nUnder the merger agreement, from and after the effective time of the merger, Berkshire has agreed that it will, and will\ncause the surviving corporation to, subject to certain limitations, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person\nwho is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement or who becomes such prior to the\neffective time of the merger, an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (\u201cindemnified parties\u201d),\nagainst (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts incurred by\nsuch person in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or\narising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries and (ii) all of such liabilities based in whole or in part on, or pertaining to, the merger agreement or the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nFrom the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation will\ncontain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation set forth in the certificate of incorporation and\namended and restated bylaws of the Company, which provisions will not be amended,\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmodified or otherwise repealed for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger in any manner that would\ndiminish or adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified party as of the effective time, unless such\nmodification is required after the effective time by law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\nThe information in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires\ndisclosure of information about certain compensation for each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers that is\nbased on or otherwise related to the merger, and assumes, among other things, that each named executive officer will\nexperience a qualifying termination immediately following the consummation of the merger. Please note that the\namounts described and quantified below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the\neffective time of the merger. For purposes of calculating the amounts included in the table below, we have assumed\nDecember 31, 2022 as the closing date of the merger and a termination of each named executive officer\u2019s employment\nby Berkshire or its subsidiaries without cause immediately following the effective time of the merger.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nName\nCash ($)\n(1)\nEquity ($)\n(2)\nTax \nReimbursements\n($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nWeston M.

Shannon\n1,157,333\n5,433,938\n2,570,444\n9,161,715\n(1)\nRepresents cash payments under the Post-Closing Severance Program upon a termination without cause by Berkshire or its\nsubsidiaries within one year following the effective time of the merger, including (i) a cash severance payment in an amount equal\nto the sum of the named executive officer\u2019s annual base salary ($1,050,000 for Mr. Brandon, $715,000 for Ms. Jacobs, $800,000\nfor Mr. Dalrymple and $500,000 for Mr. Shannon) plus the named executive officer\u2019s target annual incentive bonus or, for Mr.\nShannon, his maximum annual bonus ($2,100,000 for Mr. Brandon, $950,950 for Ms. Jacobs, $800,000 for Mr. Dalrymple and\n$600,000 for Mr. Shannon), plus (ii) a full COBRA premium cash subsidy for the one-year period following the effective time of\nthe merger (equal to $57,333 for Messrs. Brandon, Dalrymple and Shannon and $34,199 for Ms. Jacobs). All such payments are\n\u201cdouble-trigger\u201d (i.e., payable upon a qualifying termination following the effective time of the merger). Receipt of these\npayments is subject to the employee\u2019s execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates.\nMr. Brandon will receive the enhanced severance described above only if his employment termination occurs within one year\nfollowing the effective time of the merger. If Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d (other\nthan due to death or total disability) prior to the effective time of the merger, he would instead be entitled to cash severance of\n$1,050,000 pursuant to his employment agreement, subject to (i) his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company\nand its affiliates and (ii) his compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including a confidentiality provision, an invention\nassignment provision and one-year post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. Mr. Brandon\u2019s cash\nseverance pursuant to his employment agreement would be payable over time following such termination and would not be\nenhanced by reason of the merger if the effective time of the merger occurs after his termination date. For purposes of\ncalculating the amounts included in the table above, we have assumed that Mr. Brandon\u2019s employment will be terminated by the\nCompany without cause immediately following the effective time of the merger, and so we have included Mr. Brandon\u2019s enhanced\nseverance under the Post-Closing Severance Program in the table.\n(2)\nRepresents the following equity-based award related amounts for the named executive officers: (i) the value of unvested RSUs\nbased on the merger consideration\u037e and (ii) the value of unvested PSUs based on the merger consideration (assuming maximum\nlevel performance is achieved for purposes of determining the number of PSUs)\u037e in each case that would become fully vested\nupon a termination of the recipient\u2019s employment or other service by Berkshire or its subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the\nrecipient\u2019s death, \u201ctotal disability\u201d or qualified retirement (i.e., an RSU Qualified Retirement or PSU Qualified Retirement, as\napplicable) that occurs immediately following the effective time of the merger.

        "Section Text": "Treatment of Company Equity Awards\nUnder the merger agreement, equity-based awards outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be treated at\nthe effective time of the merger as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units. Each outstanding RSU, other than any Director RSU, including any dividend equivalent units\ncredited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an\namount equal to the merger consideration and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash\nto the holder of such RSU within 15 business days of the existing vesting date applicable to such RSU if the holder\ncontinues employment through the vesting date, subject to full accelerated vesting and payment within 15 business\ndays (subject to any required delay in payment required under Section 409A of the Code) of the earlier termination of\nthe holder\u2019s employment without cause or due to the holder\u2019s death, total disability or RSU Qualified Retirement. The\namount payable in respect of each RSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate until the respective payment\ndate. For any outstanding RSU that vests prior to the effective time of the merger, the RSU consideration will be paid\nwithout interest within 15 business days of the closing of the merger.\nPerformance Shares. Each outstanding PSU, other than the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units\ncredited in respect thereto, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an\namount equal to the merger consideration (assuming maximum level performance was achieved for purposes of\ndetermining the number of PSUs) and such amount, less any required withholding taxes, will be paid in cash to the\nholder of such PSU at the time specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the\napplicable performance period if the holder continues employment through the end of such performance period in\naccordance with the original payment terms of the award, without any ongoing performance-vesting conditions,\nsubject to full accelerated vesting upon the earlier termination of the holder\u2019s employment without cause or due to\nholder\u2019s death, total disability or PSU Qualified Retirement. Each PSU will be credited with interest at the prime rate\nuntil the respective payment date.\nMatch Award. The PSUs granted under the Match Award, including any dividend equivalent units credited in respect\nthereto, will also be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an\n48TABLE OF CONTENTS\namount equal to the merger consideration, less any required withholding taxes, payable in cash to Mr. Brandon at the\ntime specified in the applicable plan and award agreement following the completion of the performance period if Mr.\nBrandon continues employment through the end of such performance period in accordance with the original payment\nterms of the award. However, unlike the PSUs held by other employees, maximum level performance achievement will\nnot be assumed for purposes of determining the number of PSUs under the Match Award.

        "Section Text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nUnder Delaware law, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights of appraisal in\nconnection with the merger, provided that such holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL\n(\u201cSection 262\u201d). Pursuant to Section 262, stockholders of the Company who do not vote in favor of the merger and\nwho comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of\ntheir shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the \u201cCourt\u201d) if the merger is completed. It is possible\nthat the fair value as determined by the Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger consideration.\nStockholders should note that investment banking opinions as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, are not opinions as to, and do not in any manner\naddress, fair value under the DGCL. Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the strict\nprocedures set forth in Section 262 in order to demand and perfect their rights. Any stockholder of the Company\nwishing to preserve its rights to appraisal must make a demand for appraisal as described below.\nThe following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Section 262 required to be followed by\ndissenting Company stockholders wishing to demand and perfect their appraisal rights. This summary, however, is\nnot a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to\nSection 262, the full text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement.\nUnder Section 262, the Company is required to notify stockholders not less than 20 days before the special meeting\nto vote on the merger that appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 must be included with that notice.\nThe special meeting will be held on June 9, 2022.\nThis proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to its stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in\nconnection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 set forth\nin Annex C to this proxy statement and consult your legal advisor. If you fail to timely and properly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262, your appraisal rights may be lost. To exercise appraisal rights with respect to your\nshares of Company common stock, you must:\n\u2022\nNOT vote your shares of Company common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger\nagreement and the merger\u037e\n\u2022\ndeliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the date of the special\nmeeting, as described further below under \u201c-Written Demand and Notice\u037e\u201d\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold your shares of Company common stock through the date the merger is consummated\u037e\nand\n\u2022\notherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262.\nIf you sign, date and return a proxy card, or submit a proxy by telephone or through the internet, that does not\ncontain voting instructions, you will effectively waive your appraisal rights because such shares represented by the\nproxy, unless the proxy is revoked, will be voted for the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the\nmerger. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a\nproxy containing instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger or\nabstain from voting on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Company common stock, or a person duly authorized and explicitly purporting to\nact on that stockholder\u2019s behalf, is entitled to assert appraisal rights for the shares of Company common stock\nregistered in that stockholder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company\nof the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s Company common stock. A proxy or vote against the merger shall not constitute such a demand.\nBeneficial owners who do not also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to the\nCompany. The beneficial owner must, in such cases, have the registered stockholder submit the required demand in\nrespect of those shares.\nIf the shares of Company common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares of Company common stock are\nowned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the\n67TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more\njoint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify\nthe record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent\nfor such owner or owners. Stockholders who hold their shares of Company common stock in brokerage accounts or\nother nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine\nthe appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.\nFailure to strictly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss, termination or waiver of\nappraisal rights. Stockholders who vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the\nmerger will not have a right to have the fair market value of their shares of Company common stock determined.\nHowever, failure to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger is not\nsufficient to perfect appraisal rights. If you desire to exercise your appraisal rights, you must also submit to the\nCompany a written demand for payment of the fair value of the Company common stock held by you. In order to\nassist stockholders in determining whether to exercise appraisal rights, copies of the Company\u2019s audited\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are incorporated by reference in\nthis proxy statement.\nWritten Demand and Notice\nA written demand for appraisal should be filed with the Company before the special meeting. The demand notice shall\nbe sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company of your identity and that you wish to seek appraisal with respect to\nyour shares of Company common stock. All demands should be delivered to: Alleghany Corporation, 1411 Broadway,\n34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, Attention: Corporate Secretary.\nThe surviving corporation, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, will notify each stockholder who has\ncomplied with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger of the effective date of the merger.\nJudicial Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation or any stockholder who is entitled to\nappraisal rights and has otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a\npetition with the Court demanding a determination of the value of the Company common stock held by all such\nstockholders. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and\nholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the\nholders of Company common stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights within the time\nprescribed in Section 262. If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is\ndelivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving\nservice of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly\nverified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of\nCompany common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Company common stock have\nnot been reached by the surviving corporation. After notice to the surviving corporation and dissenting\nstockholders who demanded payment of their shares of Company common stock, the Court is empowered to conduct\na hearing upon the petition, and to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL\nand who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Court may require the stockholders who\nhave demanded appraisal for their shares of Company common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register\nin Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to\ncomply with that direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.\nAfter the Court determines the holders of Company common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding\nshall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal\nproceedings. Through this proceeding, the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element\nof value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid, if any,\nupon the amount determined to be \u201cfair value\u201d in an appraisal proceeding. In determining the fair value of the shares\nthe Court will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court\ndiscussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that\n\u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201cfair price obviously\nrequires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that\nthrow any light on future prospects of the corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,\nthe Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that \u201celements of future\nvalue, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established\nfrom time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment.\nStockholders who consider seeking appraisal should consider that the fair value of their shares under Section 262\ncould be more than, the same as, or less than, the value of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement\nwithout the exercise of appraisal rights. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Court. Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenter\u2019s exclusive remedy. The Court may determine the cost of the appraisal\nproceeding and assess it against the parties as the Court deems equitable. Upon application of a dissenting\nstockholder, the Court may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in\nconnection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and\nexpenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company common stock entitled to\nappraisal. In the absence of a court determination or assessment, each party will bear its own expenses.\nAny stockholder who has demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time, be\nentitled to vote such stock for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or other distributions, if any, on the\nCompany common stock, except for dividends or distributions, if any, payable to stockholders of record at a date\nbefore the merger.\nRequest for Appraisal Data\nIf you submit a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock and otherwise properly\nperfect your appraisal rights, you may, upon written request mailed to the surviving corporation within 120 days after\nthe effective date of the merger, receive a written statement identifying (i) the aggregate number of shares of\nCompany common stock that were not voted in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the\nmerger and with respect to which the Company has received written demands for appraisal\u037e and (ii) the aggregate\nnumber of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation will mail this statement to you within 10 days after\nreceiving your written request. If no petition is filed by either the surviving corporation or any dissenting stockholder\nwithin the 120-day period after the effective date of the merger, the rights of all dissenting stockholders to appraisal\nwill cease. Stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file\na petition with respect to the appraisal of the fair value of their shares or that the surviving corporation will initiate\nany negotiations with respect to the fair value of those shares. The surviving corporation will be under no obligation\nto take any action in this regard and the Company and Berkshire have no present intention to do so. Accordingly, it\nis the obligation of stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company common stock to initiate all\nnecessary action with respect to the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. Failure to file the petition on a timely basis will cause the stockholder\u2019s right to an appraisal\nto cease.\nWithdrawal\nEven if you submit a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock and otherwise properly\nperfect your appraisal rights, you may withdraw your demand at any time after the effective date of the merger, except\nthat any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require the\nwritten approval of the surviving corporation and, once a petition for appraisal is filed, the\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any holder absent court approval. The foregoing, however, will not\naffect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered under the merger\nagreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If you withdraw your demand, you will be deemed to\nhave accepted the terms of the merger agreement, which terms are summarized in this proxy statement and which\nagreement is attached in its entirety as Annex A to this proxy statement.\nThe foregoing summary is not intended to be a complete statement of the procedures for exercising appraisal rights\nunder Section 262 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262, a copy of which is\nattached as Annex C to this proxy statement. The Company urges any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal\nrights, if any, to read this summary and Section 262 carefully, and to consult legal counsel before attempting to\nexercise appraisal rights. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the\nloss of your statutory appraisal rights.\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon\nlearning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the\nSurviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability\nwhich it may have under this Section 6.7 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party). The\nIndemnified Parties (as a group) may each retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel in each\napplicable jurisdiction if reasonably required) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is\na conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.\n(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with\nrespect to indemnification and exculpation set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and\nRestated By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a\nperiod of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would diminish or adversely affect the rights of an\nIndemnified Party thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at the Effective Time is an\nIndemnified Party, unless such modification is required after the Effective Time by Law and then only to the\nminimum extent required by such Law.\n(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such individual\nmay have under the governing documents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or\nany other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries. The rights under this Section 6.7 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to\nbenefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.\n(d) In the event that Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)\nconsolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or\nA-27TABLE OF CONTENTS\nentity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and\nassets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and\nassigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.\n(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the\nCompany or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being\nunderstood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.7 is not prior to or in substitution\nfor any such claims under such policies\u037e provided, however, that following the Closing there shall be no\nobligation to continue or extend such policies.\nSection 6.8",
