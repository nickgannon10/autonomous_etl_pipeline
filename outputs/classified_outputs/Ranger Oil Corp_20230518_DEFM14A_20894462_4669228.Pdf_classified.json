The company merger cannot be completed without the approval of the Ranger Merger\nProposal by the Ranger shareholders. The Class B Holders, which collectively hold approximately 54%\nof the outstanding voting power of the Ranger common stock are parties to the Support Agreement with\nBaytex pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, except in limited circumstances, to (i) vote in\nfavor of the company merger, (ii) not transfer their Ranger Class B common stock and common units in\nROCC Energy Holdings, L.P. (\u201cOpco common units\u201d) between signing the Merger Agreement and the\nclosing of the Merger Transactions and (iii) exercise their right to exchange (the \u201cOpco Unit Exchange\u201d)\nall of their Opco common units and shares of Ranger Class B common stock, for shares of Ranger Class\nA common stock. For more information, please see \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fThe Support Agreement\u201d.\nWhat constitutes a quorum, and what vote is required to approve each proposal at the Ranger special meeting?\nA quorum of Ranger\u2019s shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by\nproxy, of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Ranger special\nmeeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions will be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum.\nBroker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Ranger special\nmeeting, unless the broker, bank or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the\nproposals.\nIf a quorum is not present at the Ranger special meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled\nto vote who are present or represented by proxy have the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting\nfrom time to time without notice, other than an announcement at the Ranger special meeting of the time\nand place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum is present. In addition, under the Ranger Bylaws, the\nchairman of Ranger\u2019s board has the power to adjourn the Ranger special meeting for any reason from\ntime to time without notice, other than an announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting,\nprovided that a new record date is not set. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present,\nany business may be transacted that may have been transacted at the Ranger special meeting.\nxiv \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nApproval of the Ranger Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on\nthe Ranger Merger Proposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to vote will not count as votes\ncast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the Ranger Merger Proposal. The Class B\nHolders collectively own more than a majority of the outstanding shares of Ranger common stock\nentitled to vote on the Ranger Merger Proposal and, pursuant to the Support Agreement, are obligated,\nexcept in limited circumstances, to vote these shares in favor of the Ranger Merger Proposal, which\nwould ensure its approval.\nApproval of each of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal and the Ranger Adjournment\nProposal requires that the votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal exceed the votes cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to vote will not count as votes cast and, therefore,\nwill have no effect on the outcome of the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal or the Ranger\nAdjournment Proposal.\nWhat will Ranger shareholders receive for their Ranger Class A common stock or Ranger Class B common\nstock if the Merger Transactions are completed?\nAs a condition to the completion of the Merger Transactions, immediately prior to the company merger,\nthe Class B Holders will exchange all of their shares of Ranger Class B common stock and Opco common\nunits for shares of Ranger Class A common stock in the Opco Unit Exchange. As a result, no shares of\nRanger Class B common stock will be outstanding following the Opco Unit Exchange and immediately\nprior to the merger effective time. Under the Merger Agreement, at the merger effective time, each\neligible share will be converted into the right to receive (i) 7.49 validly issued, fully paid and non-\nassessable Baytex common shares (the \u201cshare consideration\u201d) and (ii) $13.31 in cash, without interest\n(the \u201ccash consideration\u201d and, together with the share consideration, the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d). Each\nholder of Ranger Class A common stock will receive cash (without interest) in lieu of any fractional\nBaytex common shares that such shareholder would otherwise receive as share consideration in the\nMerger Transactions.\nThe share consideration is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect changes in the price of Ranger Class\nA common stock or Baytex common shares prior to the merger effective time. The Baytex common shares\nare currently listed on the NYSE and TSX under the symbol \u201cBTE.\u201d Based on the number of shares of\nRanger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock issuable pursuant to Ranger equity\nawards and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on May 17, 2023, at the merger effective\ntime, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger\u2019s equity awards, collectively, are expected to\nown approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares, and holders of Baytex common\nshares immediately prior to the Merger Transactions will own approximately 63% of the outstanding\nBaytex common shares, including for these purposes, the shares underlying the Converted Baytex\nTRSU awards. Ranger Class A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cROCC.\u201d\nWhen the company merger is completed, the Ranger Class A common stock will cease to be traded on\nthe NASDAQ and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. Ranger encourages you to obtain\ncurrent quotes for the Baytex common shares and the Ranger Class A common stock.\nBecause Baytex will issue a fixed number of Baytex common shares in exchange for each share of Ranger\nClass A common stock, the value of the merger consideration that Ranger shareholders will receive in\nthe Merger Transactions will depend on the market price of Baytex common shares at the merger\neffective time and will not be known at the time that Ranger shareholders vote on the Merger\nTransactions. The market price of Baytex common shares that Ranger shareholders receive at the merger\neffective time could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of Baytex common shares\non the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Ranger special meeting. Based on\nthe closing price of Baytex common shares of $4.31 on the NYSE on February 27, 2023, the last full\ntrading day prior to the day on which the company merger was announced, the implied value of the\nmerger consideration to Ranger shareholders was approximately $45.59 per share of Ranger Class A\ncommon stock. On May 17, 2023, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the closing price of Baytex common shares on the NYSE was $3.35 per share,\nresulting in an implied value of the merger consideration to Ranger shareholders of $38.40 per share of\nRanger Class A common stock.\nxv \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in oil and natural gas prices,\nBaytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations and\ngeneral business, market, industry or economic conditions. However, the merger consideration will be\nequitably adjusted to provide Ranger and Baytex shareholders with the same economic effect as\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement in the event of any reclassification, stock split (including a\nreverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger or other similar transaction\ninvolving Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares prior to the merger effective time.\nFor more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Ranger shareholders if the\nMerger Transactions are completed, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMerger Consideration\u201d on\npage 44.\nWhat will holders of Ranger equity awards receive in the company merger?\nEach Ranger TRSU award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award,\nin each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into\nConverted Baytex TRSU awards at the closing, with the number of Baytex common shares subject to the\nConverted Baytex TRSU awards equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ranger common\nstock subject to such Ranger TRSU award or Ranger PBRSU award (at the maximum level of\nperformance), as applicable, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the cash consideration divided by the\nvolume weighted average price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive\ntrading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (y) the share\nconsideration, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Converted Baytex TRSU awards\nin respect of Ranger TRSU awards will remain subject to the same vesting schedule and Converted\nBaytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU awards will be converted based on the number of\nshares payable upon maximum performance and will remain subject to the same time-vesting schedule.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, upon (i) an involuntary termination of the holder\u2019s employment or\nservice by Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without \u201cCause\u201d  (as defined in the Ranger Equity\nPlan) or (ii) solely with respect to a Converted Baytex TRSU award that was converted from a Ranger\nequity award that had such a provision in the award agreement pursuant to which such Ranger equity\naward was granted, a resignation by the holder for \u201cGood Reason\u201d  (as defined in such applicable award\nagreement), in each case, that occurs on or within 12 months following the merger effective time, such\nawards will immediately vest in full as of such termination date.\nAny dividend equivalents that have been accrued with respect to Ranger equity awards will become\npayable ratably if and when such underlying Converted Baytex TRSU award vests.\nEach Ranger Director TRSU award will vest in full at the merger effective time and, by virtue of the\noccurrence of the closing, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, without interest, the\nmerger consideration with respect to each share of Ranger common stock subject to such Ranger\nDirector TRSU award plus the amount of any dividend equivalents payable with respect to such Ranger\nDirector TRSU award that remain unpaid as of the merger effective time. No fractional Baytex common\nshare will be issued in respect of a Ranger Director TRSU award, and any such fractional Baytex\ncommon share will instead be paid in cash.\nFor additional information regarding the treatment of Ranger equity awards, please see \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Ranger Equity Awards.\u201d\nHow do I vote my shares of Ranger common stock?\nIf you were a holder of record of Ranger common stock as of the Ranger Record Date, you may submit\nyour proxy before the Ranger special meeting in one of the following ways:\nTelephone\u202f-\u202fuse the toll-free number shown on your proxy card\u037e\nInternet\u202f-\u202fvisit the website shown on your proxy card to vote via the Internet\u037e or\nMail\u202f-\u202fcomplete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.\nxvi \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank\nor other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee to\nensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted.

Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.\nWhat happens if the Merger Transactions are not completed?\nIf the Ranger Merger Proposal is not approved by Ranger shareholders or the Baytex share issuance\nresolution is not approved by the Baytex shareholders, or if the Merger Transactions are not completed\nfor any other reason, Ranger shareholders will not receive the merger consideration or any other\nconsideration in connection with the Merger Transactions, and their Ranger common stock will remain\noutstanding.\nIf the Merger Transactions are not completed, Baytex and Ranger will each remain public companies\nindependent of one another, the Ranger Class A common stock will continue to be listed and traded on\nthe NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cROCC,\u201d and the Baytex common shares will continue to trade on the\nNYSE and TSX under the symbol \u201cBTE.\u201d\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Ranger may be required to pay\nBaytex a termination payment of $60.0 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified\ncircumstances, Baytex may be required to pay Ranger a termination payment of $100.0 million. See the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger Agreement\u201d on page 140 for a more\ndetailed discussion of the termination payments.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal?\nUnder SEC rules, Ranger is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote of its shareholders with\nrespect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Ranger\u2019s named executive officers\nthat is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement.\nWhat happens if Ranger shareholders do not approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal?\nBecause the vote to approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal is advisory in nature, the\noutcome of the vote will not be binding upon Ranger or the combined company, and the completion of\nthe Merger Transactions are not conditioned or dependent upon the approval of the Ranger\nCompensation Advisory Proposal. Accordingly, the compensation that is subject to the vote, which is\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of Ranger\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nxvii \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Merger\u201d on page 79 of this proxy statement/prospectus, may be paid to Ranger\u2019s named executive\nofficers even if Ranger\u2019s shareholders do not approve the Ranger Compensation Advisory Proposal.\nWhat is the difference between a shareholder of record and a shareholder who holds Ranger common stock in\nstreet name?\nShareholders of Record.

The Merger Agreement requires Baytex\u2019s acquisition of Ranger to be completed by\nthe outside date of October 15, 2023.\nWhat equity stake will Ranger shareholders hold in Baytex immediately following the Merger Transactions?\nBased on the number of shares of Ranger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock\nissuable pursuant to Ranger equity awards, and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on\nMay 17, 2023, at the merger effective time, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger\u2019s equity\nawards, collectively, are expected to own approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares,\nincluding the shares issuable upon future settlement of the converted awards, and persons who were\nBaytex shareholders immediately prior to the Merger Transactions are expected to own approximately\n63% of the outstanding Baytex common shares, including for these purposes, the shares underlying the\nConverted Baytex TRSU awards. The relative ownership interests of Baytex shareholders and former\nRanger shareholders in Baytex immediately following the Merger Transactions will depend on the\nnumber of Baytex common shares and shares of Ranger common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the merger effective time.\nIf I am a holder of Ranger Class A common stock, how will I receive the merger consideration to which I am\nentitled?\nIf you hold your shares of Ranger Class A common stock in book-entry form, whether through The\nx\nx \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDepository Trust Company or otherwise, you will not be required to take any specific actions to\nexchange your Ranger Class A common stock for Baytex common shares and the cash consideration.\nYour shares of Ranger Class A common stock will, at the merger effective time, be automatically\nexchanged for the Baytex common shares and cash (including any cash in lieu of fractional Baytex\ncommon shares) to which you are entitled.

The historical and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information\npresented below has been derived from the audited historical financial statements of Baytex and Ranger as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2022 and from the unaudited interim financial statements of Baytex and\nRanger as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2023, with certain pro forma adjustments to\ngive pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that Baytex uses to\nmonitor its financial leverage and compliance with financial covenants and is calculated by adjusting net\nincome or loss for financing and interest expenses, income tax, non-recurring items, and certain unrealized\nand non-cash transactions as set forth in the following table. Adjusted EBITDA does not have a\nstandardized meaning prescribed by IFRS or GAAP and may not be comparable with calculations of similar\nmeasures presented by other reporting issuers. Adjusted EBITDA allows Baytex\u2019s management to evaluate\nits financial performance and compare results between periods without regard to capital structure. Baytex\nmanagement believes adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in assessing its financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and the investment community.\nPeriod Ended \nMarch 31, 2023\nBaytex\nUSD \nRanger\nCAD \nRanger\nPresentation \nconforming \nadjustments\nNote\nCAD \nRanger \nAdjusted \nBalances \n(Note 3g)\nFinancing \nTransactions \n(Note 3h)\nNotes\nMerger \nTransactions\nNote\nPro forma \nconsolidated\nIFRS\nGAAP\nGAAP\nIFRS\nIFRS\nIFRS\nNet income\n$ 51,441 $113,791 $153,928\n$(29,071\n$124,857\n(17,824\n$(23,896\n$134,578\nTransaction\ncosts\n8,871\n-\n-\n3,334\n3,334\n-\n(12,205\n6a\n-\nExploration and\nevaluation\n163\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n163\nDepletion and\ndepreciation\n165,999\n85,303\n115,389\n27,847\n3d\n143,236\n-\n14,013\n6b\n323,248\nNon-cash share-\nbased \ncompensation\n-\n-\n-\n2,774\n3c\n2,774\n-\n-\n2,774\nFinancing and \ninterest\n23,725\n14,718\n19,909\n1,224\n3f\n21,133\n17,824\n6c\n-\n62,682\nUnrealized\nfinancial\nderivatives\n(gain) \nloss\n(9,210\n(33,016\n(44,661\n-\n(44,661\n-\n-\n(53,871\nUnrealized\nforeign\nexchange gain\n(213\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(213\nLoss on\ndispositions\n336\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n336\nNon-cash other \nincome\n(1,271\n349\n472\n-\n472\n-\n-\n(799\nCurrent income\ntax expense\n1,120\n185\n250\n-\n250\n-\n-\n1,370\nDeferred\nincome tax\nexpense\n15,523\n806\n1,090\n-\n1,090\n-\n22,088\n6d\n38,701\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\n$256,484 $182,136 $246,377\n$\n6,108\n$252,485\n$\n0\n$\n0\n$508,969\n12 \n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information set forth in\nand incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, before making a decision on the\nRanger Proposals. As Baytex shareholders following the merger effective time, Ranger shareholders will be\nsubject to all risks inherent in the business of Baytex in addition to the risks relating to Ranger. The\nmarket value of Baytex common shares will reflect the performance of the business relative to, among other\nthings, that of the competitors of Baytex and Ranger and general economic, market and industry\nconditions. The value of your investment may increase or may decline and could result in a loss.\nIn addition, Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s respective businesses are subject to numerous risks and\nuncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described, in the case of Ranger, in its Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and, in the case of Baytex, in its Annual Report on\nForm 40-F and corresponding Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2022, and\nsubsequent filings with the SEC which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nFor more information, please see the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information\u201d\non page 196.\nRisks Relating to the Merger Transactions\nBecause the number of Baytex common shares constituting part of the merger consideration is fixed and the market\nprice of Baytex common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, Ranger shareholders cannot be sure of\nthe value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger Transactions prior to the closing of the Merger\nTransactions.\nAt the merger effective time, each eligible share will be converted into the right to receive 7.49 Baytex\ncommon shares and $13.31 in cash, without interest. Because the number of Baytex common shares that\nconstitute part of the merger consideration is fixed, the value of the merger consideration will depend on the\nmarket price of Baytex common shares at the merger effective time. The market price of Baytex common\nshares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Transactions and is expected to\ncontinue to fluctuate from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus until the closing date, which could\noccur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Changes in the price of Baytex common shares\nmay result from a variety of factors, including, among others, crude oil and natural gas prices, general market\nand economic conditions, changes in Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s respective businesses, operations and\nprospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that\nthe Merger Transactions will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the Merger\nTransactions and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the Merger Transactions and\nregulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s control.\nThe Baytex common shares to be received by Ranger shareholders at the merger effective time will have different\nrights from shares of Ranger Class A common stock.\nAt the merger effective time, Ranger shareholders will no longer be shareholders of Ranger but will\ninstead have the right to become shareholders of Baytex. The rights of former Ranger shareholders will then\nbe governed by Alberta law and by the terms of the Baytex Articles and Baytex By-laws, which are in some\nrespects materially different than the terms of the Ranger Articles and Ranger Bylaws, which currently\ngovern the rights of Ranger shareholders. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled\n\u201cComparison of Rights of Baytex and Ranger Shareholders,\u201d on page 168 for a discussion of the different\nrights associated with Baytex common shares and Ranger common stock.\nThe Merger Transactions are subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals\nas well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when they may be completed.\nClosing of the Merger Transactions is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions\nspecified in the Merger Agreement, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise\nmaterially adversely affect the completion of the Merger Transactions. These conditions include, among\nother\n17 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthings: (1) receipt of the Ranger shareholder approval\u037e (2) receipt of the Baytex shareholder approval\u037e (3)\neffectiveness of the Form F-4 (of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part) in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form F-4 having been\nissued and remaining in effect and no proceeding to that effect having been commenced\u037e (4) the absence of\nany injunction or similar order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger Transactions\u037e\n(5) approval of applicable antitrust authorities\u037e (6) the Baytex common shares issuable in the company\nmerger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX,\nsubject to customary listing requirements\u037e (7) the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties,\nsubject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e (8) compliance by each party in all\nmaterial respects with such party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement\u037e and (9) with respect to Baytex,\nthe absence of a Ranger material adverse effect, and with respect to Ranger, the absence of a Baytex material\nadverse effect\u037e and (10) consummation of the Opco Unit Exchange.\nThe governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in\nadministering the governing laws and regulations and may take into account various facts and\ncircumstances in their consideration of the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThese governmental authorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the Merger\nTransactions. As a condition to authorization of the Merger Transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require\ndivestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Baytex\u2019s business after the combination of Baytex and\nRanger following receipt of final antitrust approval. Additionally, if the marketing period has not ended at the\ntime of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the closing can be\ndelayed until the second business day following the final day of the marketing period (provided that Baytex\nmay elect to terminate the marketing period early on no less than two business days\u2019 notice to Ranger).\nBaytex and Ranger cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be\nobtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required\nconsents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable),\nBaytex and Ranger cannot provide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents\nand approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger Transactions. Many of the conditions to\ncompletion of the Merger Transactions are not within either Ranger\u2019s or Baytex\u2019s control, and neither\ncompany can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in\ncompleting the Merger Transactions could cause Ranger and/or Baytex not to realize some or all of the\nbenefits that each expects to achieve if the Merger Transactions are successfully completed within the\nexpected timeframe. Moreover, if the company merger is not completed by October 15, 2023, either Baytex or\nRanger may choose not to proceed with the company merger, and the parties can mutually decide to\nterminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. In addition, Baytex and\nRanger may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the\nMerger Agreement.\nIn order to complete the Merger Transactions, Baytex and Ranger must obtain certain governmental approvals,\nand if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties,\ncompletion of the Merger Transactions may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented and the anticipated benefits of the\nMerger Transactions could be reduced.\nOn April 12, 2023 (at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time), the waiting period under the HSR Act expired. The\nexpiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the conditions of the Merger\nTransactions. No assurance can be given that other required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained\nor that the required conditions to the completion of the Merger Transactions will be satisfied. Even if all such\nconsents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as\nto the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents,\norders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations\nor assets of Ranger and Baytex or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the\nconduct of Ranger\u2019s or Baytex\u2019s business, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended\nperiod of time to be obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that an adverse event\noccurs with respect to Ranger or Baytex. Such extended period of time also may increase the chance that\nother adverse effects with respect to Ranger or Baytex could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Even\n18 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nif all necessary approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of\nsuch approvals. For more information, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fRegulatory Approvals\nRequired for the Merger Transactions\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the\nCompany Merger,\u201d on pages 87 and 139, respectively.\nThe Ranger special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been\nobtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if\nthe Ranger Merger Proposal is approved by Ranger shareholders, Ranger may not be required to seek further\napproval of Ranger shareholders.\nAfter Baytex\u2019s combination with Ranger, Baytex may fail to realize projected benefits of the combination, which\ncould adversely affect the value of Baytex common shares.\nBaytex and Ranger have operated and, pending closing of the company merger, will continue to operate\nindependently. The success of Baytex\u2019s combination with Ranger will depend, in part, on Baytex\u2019s ability to\nrealize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Ranger and Baytex following the company\nmerger, including operational and financial benefits that Baytex and Ranger believe the combined company\nwill achieve. The anticipated benefits of Baytex\u2019s combination with Ranger may not be realized fully or at all,\nmay take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that Baytex and Ranger do not\ncurrently foresee. Some of the assumptions that have been made, which include but are not limited to,\nincreased shareholder returns, enhanced inventory and a lower asset level free cash flow break-even price,\nmay not be realized. The integration process may, for Ranger and Baytex, result in the loss of key employees,\nthe disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nThere could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger\nTransactions that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain\naspects of the operations and personnel of Baytex with Ranger after the combination of Baytex and Ranger\nwill involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. Additionally, the\nintegration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may\ndisrupt the business of the combined company.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger Transactions could adversely affect each of Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger Transactions could cause disruptions in and create\nuncertainty surrounding Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s business, including affecting Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s\nrelationships with their existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an\nadverse effect on Ranger\u2019s or Baytex\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of\nwhether the Merger Transactions are completed. In particular, Ranger and Baytex could potentially lose\nimportant personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in\nlight of the Merger Transactions. Ranger and Baytex could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and\nnew customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. The attention of Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s\nrespective management may be directed towards closing the Merger Transactions, including obtaining\nrequired approvals and other Transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day\nbusiness operations of Ranger and Baytex and matters related to the Merger Transactions may require\ncommitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that\nmight have been beneficial to Ranger and Baytex. Additionally, the Merger Agreement requires each party to\nobtain the other party\u2019s consent prior to taking certain specified actions while the Merger Transactions are\npending. These restrictions may prevent Baytex and Ranger from pursuing otherwise attractive business\nopportunities prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions. Any of these matters could adversely affect\nthe businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of Ranger or Baytex\nand the market value of Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares.\nIf the Merger Transactions do not close, the prices of Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex\ncommon shares may fall to the extent that the current prices of Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex\ncommon shares reflect a market assumption that the Merger Transactions will close. In addition, the failure to\nclose the Merger Transactions may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of Ranger or Baytex\nin the investment community and may affect Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s relationship with employees, customers,\nsuppliers and other partners in the business community.\n19 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRanger and Baytex will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger Transactions.\nRanger and Baytex have incurred and expect to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in\nconnection with the Merger Transactions, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals and, in\nthe case of Ranger, compensation payments to its executives triggered by the change in control of Ranger as\na result of the Merger Transactions. Ranger and Baytex have incurred significant financial services,\naccounting, tax and legal fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the\nMerger Transactions. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of\ncoordinating and combining the businesses of Ranger and Baytex. Even if the Merger Transactions do not\nclose, Ranger and Baytex will need to pay certain costs relating to the Merger Transactions incurred prior to\nthe date the Merger Transactions were abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing\nand printing fees. Such costs may be significant and could have an adverse effect on the parties\u2019 future\nresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Ranger will be required to pay to Baytex a\n$60.0 million termination payment. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated under specified circumstances, Baytex may be required to pay $100.0 million to Ranger. For more\ninformation, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement,\u201d on\npage 140.\nCompletion of the Merger Transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to\nwhich Ranger is a party.\nThe completion of the Merger Transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain\nagreements to which Ranger is a party. If Ranger is unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the\ncounterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the\nagreements, or seeking monetary damages. Even if Ranger is able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties\nmay require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Ranger.\nSignificant demands will be placed on Baytex and Ranger as a result of the combination of the two companies.\nAs a result of the combination of Baytex and Ranger, significant demands will be placed on the\nmanagerial, operational, and financial personnel and systems of Baytex and Ranger. Baytex and Ranger\ncannot assure you that their respective systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the\nexpansion of operations following and resulting from the combination of the two companies. The future\noperating results of the combined company will be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to\nmanage changing business conditions and to implement and expand its operational and financial controls\nand reporting systems in response to the Merger Transactions.\nThe unaudited pro forma reserve and production data included in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for\nillustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the reserves or production of the combined company\nfollowing the combination of Baytex and Ranger.\nThe pro forma reserve and production information in this proxy statement/prospectus is presented for\nillustrative purposes only, is based on certain assumptions, addresses a hypothetical situation and reflects\nlimited historical reserves and production data. Therefore, the pro forma reserve and production information\nis not necessarily indicative of what the combined company\u2019s actual reserve or production data would have\nbeen had the Merger Transactions been completed on the date indicated or of the future reserve or\nproduction of the combined company. Accordingly, the combined company\u2019s reserves and production may\ndiffer significantly from those indicated by the pro forma reserve and production information included in this\nproxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial\nInformation,\u201d on page 148, for additional information.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Ranger and Baytex is presented for illustrative\npurposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition of the combined company\nfollowing the combination of Baytex and Ranger.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus\nhas been prepared using the consolidated historical financial statements of Baytex and Ranger,\n20 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nis presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an indication of the results of\noperations or financial condition of the combined company after the combination of Baytex and Ranger. In\naddition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information included in this proxy statement/\u200b\nprospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the Merger Transactions. These assumptions\nmay not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company\u2019s results of operations or\nfinancial condition following the combination of Baytex and Ranger. Accordingly, the historical information\nincorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and unaudited pro forma consolidated financial\ninformation included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily represent the combined\ncompany\u2019s results of operations and financial condition had Ranger and Baytex operated as a combined\nentity during the periods presented, or of the combined company\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition after the combination of Baytex and Ranger. The combined company\u2019s potential for future\nbusiness success and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses\nand difficulties typically encountered by recently combined companies.\nIn preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information contained in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, Baytex has given effect to, among other items, the combination of Baytex and Ranger,\nthe payment of the merger consideration and the indebtedness of Baytex on a consolidated basis after giving\neffect to the combination of Baytex and Ranger, including the indebtedness of Ranger. The unaudited pro\nforma consolidated financial information may not reflect all of the costs that are expected to be incurred by\nRanger and Baytex in connection with the Merger Transactions. For more information, see the section\nentitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information,\u201d on page 148.\nBaytex or Ranger may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting shareholder approval.\nCertain conditions to Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s obligations, respectively, to close the Merger Transactions\nmay be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally permissible, either unilaterally or by agreement of\nBaytex and Ranger. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of Baytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s\nshareholders or an amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable, the parties will have the\ndiscretion to close the Merger Transactions without seeking further approval of Baytex or Ranger\nshareholders, as applicable.\nThe opinion of Ranger\u2019s financial advisor rendered to the Ranger board does not reflect changes in circumstances\nbetween the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger Transactions.\nThe Ranger board has received an opinion from BofA Securities, Ranger\u2019s financial advisor, dated\nFebruary 27, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the various\nassumptions and limitations as described in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by\nthe Ranger shareholders was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Ranger shareholders, but has not\nobtained an updated opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Changes in the operations\nand prospects of Baytex or Ranger, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be\nbeyond the control of Baytex or Ranger, and on which the forecasts and assumptions used by BofA\nSecurities in connection with the rendering of its opinion may have been based, may significantly alter the\nvalue of Baytex or Ranger or the prices of the Baytex common shares or of the shares of Ranger Class A\ncommon stock by the time the Merger Transactions are completed. The opinion did not speak as of the time\nthe Merger Transactions will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion and the\nRanger board does not anticipate asking BofA Securities to update its opinion. The Ranger board\u2019s\nrecommendation that Ranger shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the Ranger Merger Proposal, however, is\nmade as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.\nFor a description of the opinion that the Ranger board received from BofA Securities, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fOpinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\u202f-\u202fFinancial Advisor to Ranger\u201d on page 60. A copy\nof the opinion of BofA Securities is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus and is\nincorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\nWhile the Merger Transactions are pending, Baytex and Ranger are subject to business uncertainties and\ncontractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect Baytex and Ranger\u2019s operating results, financial\nposition and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers, vendors or customers.\nThe Merger Agreement generally requires Baytex and Ranger to use reasonable best efforts to conduct\ntheir respective business in all material respects in the ordinary course prior to the earlier of the termination\n21 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the Merger Agreement and the closing date, including using their reasonable best efforts to preserve\nsubstantially intact their present business organization, goodwill and assets and preserve their existing\nrelationships with governmental entities and their significant customers, suppliers and others having\nsignificant business dealings with them. In addition, the Merger Agreement includes a variety of specified\nrestrictions on the conduct of both parties\u2019 businesses, which, in the event the Merger Agreement is not\nearlier terminated, expire on the closing date. Among other things and subject to the other terms of the\nMerger Agreement and certain other exceptions and limitations, Baytex and Ranger may not, outside of the\nordinary course of business, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of their stock outside of\ntheir equity incentive plans, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property,\ndispose of businesses or assets, enter into certain material contracts or make certain additional capital\nexpenditures. The parties may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement\ndelay or prevent them from making certain changes, or limit their ability to make certain changes, during such\nperiod, even if their management believes that making certain changes may be advisable. The pendency of\nthe Merger Transactions may also divert managements\u2019 attention and either parties\u2019 resources from ongoing\nbusiness and operations.\nBaytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors or customers may experience uncertainties about\nthe effects of the Merger Transactions. It is possible that some employees, suppliers, vendors or customers\nand other parties with whom Baytex and Ranger have a business relationship with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with Baytex\nor Ranger as a result of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, current and prospective employees may\nexperience uncertainty about their future roles with Baytex and Ranger following completion of the Merger\nTransactions, which may materially and adversely affect Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nkey employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact Baytex\u2019s and\nRanger\u2019s operating results, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price.\nTo consummate the Merger Transactions and fund the operations of the combined company, Baytex expects to\nrefinance the Ranger credit facility and senior notes with a combination of new committed credit facilities and the\nBaytex 8.500% Senior Notes. The debt commitment letters that provide for the new committed credit facilities\ncontain certain conditions to close.\nOn February 27, 2023, CIBC, RBC and BNS entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing\nfor a debt financing transaction, the proceeds of which will be used to partially fund the Merger\nTransactions. Pursuant to the debt commitment letters, CIBC, RBC and BNS committed to provide the Baytex\nnew bank facility and the Baytex term loan, and CIBC and RBC committed to provide the Baytex bridge loan.\nOn April 27, 2023, Baytex closed the private offering of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes that generated\nnet proceeds of $776.7 million. The gross proceeds of the offering were deposited into escrow pending\nsatisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Merger Transactions.\nUpon satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, Baytex intends to use the net proceeds from the offering,\ntogether with borrowings under its credit facilities, to pay a portion of the merger consideration, to repay\nindebtedness outstanding under the Ranger credit facility, to pay any termination payments payable upon\nany early termination of Ranger\u2019s hedge agreements, to satisfy, discharge and redeem the Ranger senior\nnotes, to repay indebtedness owing to any exiting lenders under the Baytex bank facility and to pay fees and\nexpenses in connection with the foregoing.\nAt the closing of the company merger, Baytex intends to increase the revolving capacity of the Baytex\nnew bank facility from the current US$1.0 billion committed amount to US$1.1 billion, with the current\nmaturity date of April 1, 2026 remaining unchanged, and to amend the facility to provide for the Baytex term\nloan, which will mature two years from the closing date of the company merger. As a result of the completion\nof the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.\nThe commitment of the Baytex term loan and Baytex new bank facility are described in the debt\ncommitment letter. However, Baytex has not entered into definitive agreements for such debt financing, and\nthe obligation of the lenders to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter is subject to a\nnumber of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that Baytex will be able to obtain the debt\nfinancing under the debt commitment letter. In the event that the debt financing contemplated above is not\n22 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\navailable, other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If Baytex is\nunable to obtain debt financing, the Merger Transactions may be delayed or not be completed. Baytex\u2019s\nobligation to complete the Merger Transactions is not conditioned upon the receipt of any financing.\nFailure by Baytex to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives regarding the combined company\u2019s\nbusiness may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined company and the market value of Baytex\ncommon shares.\nThe success of the combination of Baytex and Ranger will depend, in part, on the ability of Baytex to\nsuccessfully execute the combined company\u2019s business strategy. If Baytex is not able to achieve its\nbusiness strategy on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the combination of Baytex and Ranger may\nnot be realized fully or at all, and the combination may materially adversely affect the results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects of the combined company and the market value of Baytex common shares.\nFailure to complete the Merger Transactions could negatively impact the price of the Ranger Class A common\nstock, and future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger Transactions are not completed for any reason, Ranger\u2019s ongoing business may be\nmaterially and adversely affected and Ranger would be subject to a number of risks, including, but not\nlimited to, the following:\nRanger may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on\ntrading prices of the Ranger Class A common stock, and from Ranger\u2019s employees, suppliers,\nvendors, regulators or customers\u037e\nRanger will be required to pay Baytex a termination payment of $60.0 million, if the Merger Agreement\nis terminated in certain circumstances, including because the Ranger board has changed its\nrecommendation in favor of the Merger Transactions\u037e\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Ranger\u2019s business, and such\nrestrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Baytex, may prevent Ranger from making\ncertain material acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain other\nspecified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger\nTransactions that Ranger would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place\u037e\nand\nmatters relating to the Merger Transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial\ncommitments of time and resources by Ranger\u2019s management and the expenditure of significant funds\nin the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations\nand other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Ranger as an independent company.\nIn addition, Ranger could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger\nTransactions or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce Ranger\u2019s performance obligations under the\nMerger Agreement.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect Ranger\u2019s business, financial\ncondition, financial results and stock price.\nDirectors and executive officers of Ranger have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ from the\ninterests of Ranger shareholders generally, including, if the Merger Transactions are completed, the receipt of\nfinancial and other benefits.\nIn considering the recommendations of the Ranger board, Ranger shareholders should be aware that,\naside from their interests as Ranger shareholders, Ranger\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in\nthe Merger Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Ranger shareholders\ngenerally. These interests include, among others, the potential payment of severance payments and benefits\nand acceleration of certain equity-based awards.\n23 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThese interests are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of Ranger\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d on page 79.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the merger effective time has not occurred by the outside date, either Ranger or\nBaytex may choose not to proceed with the Merger Transactions.\nEither Ranger or Baytex may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger effective time has not\noccurred by October 15, 2023 (i.e., the outside date). However, this right to terminate the Merger Agreement\nwill not be available to Ranger or Baytex if such party has failed to fulfill any covenant or agreement under\nthe Merger Agreement that has been the primary cause of or resulted in the failure to consummate the\nMerger Transactions on or before the outside date. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger Agreement,\u201d on page 140.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Baytex follows certain home country corporate governance practices instead of\notherwise applicable SEC and NYSE requirements, which may reduce the frequency and scope of information and\nprotections to which investors are entitled.\nAs a foreign private issuer, in reliance on NYSE rules that permit a foreign private issuer to follow the\ncorporate governance practices of its home country, Baytex is permitted to follow certain Canadian corporate\ngovernance practices instead of those otherwise required under the corporate governance standards for U.S.\ndomestic issuers, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as board, committee and director\nindependence requirements. Baytex is required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate\ngovernance practices differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE listing\nstandards in its annual report filed with the SEC or on its website. Baytex follows Canadian home country\npractices with regard to matters such as obtaining shareholder approval for certain dilutive events.\nAccordingly, Baytex\u2019s shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under NYSE\ncorporate governance rules. Following Canadian home country governance practices as opposed to the\nrequirements that would otherwise apply to a U.S. company listed on the NYSE may provide less protection\nthan is accorded to investors in U.S. domestic issuers.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Baytex is not subject to the provisions of Regulation FD or U.S. proxy rules and will be\nexempt from filing certain Exchange Act reports, which could result in the Baytex common shares being less\nattractive to investors.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Baytex is exempt from a number of requirements under U.S. securities laws\nthat apply to public companies that are not foreign private issuers. In particular, Baytex is exempt from the\nrules and regulations under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and\nBaytex\u2019s officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit\nrecovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, Baytex will not be required\nunder the Exchange Act to file annual and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as\nfrequently or as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange\nAct and Baytex will generally be exempt from filing quarterly reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nBaytex will also be exempt from the provisions of Regulation FD, which prohibits the selective disclosure of\nmaterial nonpublic information to, among others, broker-dealers and holders of a company\u2019s securities under\ncircumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the holder will trade in Baytex\u2019s securities on the\nbasis of the information. Further, certain information may be provided by Baytex in accordance with\nCanadian law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the Exchange\nAct. For example, Baytex\u2019s financial statements are currently presented in accordance with IFRS and its\nreserves and production disclosure is presented in accordance with the rules of Canadian Securities\nRegulators. In addition, disclosure with respect to Baytex annual meetings of shareholders will be governed\nby Canadian law. These exemptions and leniencies may reduce the frequency and scope of information and\nprotections to which you are entitled as an investor.\nBaytex may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and\nexpenses.\nBaytex would lose its foreign private issuer status if a majority of its shares are held by U.S. residents\nand a majority of its directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents, more than half of its assets\n24 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nare located in the United States, or its business is administered principally in the United States. After giving\neffect to the Merger Transactions, Baytex believes more than half of its assets may be located in the United\nStates and U.S. ownership of its shares will increase significantly. As a result, Baytex could experience a loss\nof its foreign private issuer status in the future, which would make compliance with certain U.S. regulatory\nprovisions mandatory. The regulatory and compliance costs to Baytex under U.S. securities laws as a U.S.\ndomestic issuer may be significantly higher than the costs Baytex incurs as a Canadian foreign private issuer\neligible to use the Multi-Jurisdictional Disclosure System (\u201cMJDS\u201d). If Baytex ceases to be a foreign private\nissuer, it would not be eligible to use the MJDS or other foreign issuer forms and will be required to file\nperiodic and current reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which\nare more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer, and to report reserve and\nproduction information under U.S. Standards. Baytex may also be required to modify certain of its policies to\ncomply with the governance obligations of U.S. domestic issuers. Such modifications will involve additional\ncosts. In addition, Baytex would lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance\nrequirements on the NYSE that are available to foreign private issuers.\nBaytex discloses reserves information in accordance with Canadian standards and Ranger discloses reserves\ninformation accordance with U.S. Standards. There are significant differences in the types of volumes disclosed and\nthe basis from which the volumes are economically determined under U.S. Standards and Canadian standards, and\nthe difference between the reported volumes under the two disclosure standards can, therefore, be material.\nBaytex\u2019s reserves information that is included in Baytex\u2019s Annual Report on Form 40-F and incorporated\nby reference herein have been prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in National Instrument 51-\n101\u202f- Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (\u201cNI 51-101\u201d), as adopted by the Canadian Securities\nAdministrators, and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (\u201cCOGE Handbook\u201d). Ranger\u2019s reserves\ninformation has been prepared in accordance with the SEC disclosure requirements set forth in the U.S.\nStandards. There are significant differences in the types of volumes disclosed and the basis from which\nreserves volumes are economically determined under the U.S. Standards and NI 51-101, and the difference\nbetween reported reserves under the two disclosure standards can, therefore, be material. For example, the\nCOGE Handbook and NI 51-101 require disclosure of reserves and related future net revenue estimates based\non forecast prices and costs, whereas the U.S. Standards require that reserves and related future net revenue\nbe estimated using average prices for the previous 12 months and that the standardized measure reflect\ndiscounted future net income taxes related to the company\u2019s operations. In addition, the COGE Handbook\nand NI 51-101 permit the presentation of reserves estimates on a \u201ccompany gross\u201d basis (representing the\ncompany\u2019s working interest share before deduction of royalties) and \u201ccompany net\u201d basis (after the\ndeduction of royalties and similar payments), whereas the U.S. Standards require the presentation of net\nreserve estimates after the deduction of royalties and similar payments only. There are also differences in the\ntechnical reserves estimation standards applicable under NI 51-101 and, pursuant thereto, the COGE\nHandbook, and those applicable under the U.S. Standards, along with NI 51-101 requiring a more granular\nproduct type classification than required by U.S. Standards. NI 51-101 also requires that proved\nundeveloped reserves be reviewed annually for retention or reclassification if development has not\nproceeded as previously planned, while the U.S. Standards impose a five-year limit after initial booking for\nthe development of proved undeveloped reserves. Finally, the SEC prohibits disclosure of oil and gas\nresources in SEC filings, including contingent resources, whereas Canadian securities regulatory authorities\nallow disclosure of oil and gas resources. Resources are different than, and should not be construed as,\nreserves. The foregoing is not an exhaustive summary of Canadian or U.S. reserves reporting requirements.\nExcept for the supplemental reserve information and standardized measure of discounted future net cash\nflows prepared in accordance with the provisions of ASC 932 included as Exhibit 99.10 to Baytex\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 40-F, all data on oil and natural gas reserves contained in the documents incorporated by\nreference into this proxy statement/prospectus by Baytex generally have been prepared and are presented in\naccordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, which are not comparable in all respects to U.S.\nStandards or other foreign disclosure standards. As a consequence, except for the reserves information\npresented in accordance with ASC 932, Baytex\u2019s reserves estimates and certain production volumes that are\npresented on a gross basis may not be comparable to those made by Ranger under U.S. Standards.\n25 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBaytex is organized under the laws of Alberta and a substantial portion of its assets are, and many of its directors\nand officers reside, outside of the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability\nprovisions of the securities laws of the U.S. against Baytex, its officers, or members of the Baytex board.\nBaytex is organized under the laws of Alberta. A substantial portion of Baytex\u2019s assets are located\noutside the United States, and many of Baytex\u2019s directors and officers and some of the experts named in this\nproxy statement/prospectus are residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States and the assets of such\npersons may be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect\nservice within the United States upon Baytex and those directors, officers and experts, or to enforce\njudgments obtained in U.S. courts against Baytex or such persons either inside or outside of the United\nStates, or to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against Baytex or such persons in courts in\njurisdictions outside the United States, in any action predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nfederal securities laws of the United States. There is no certainty that civil liabilities predicated solely upon\nthe federal securities laws of the United States can be enforced in Canada, whether by original action or by\nseeking to enforce a judgment of U.S. courts. In addition, punitive damages awards in actions brought in the\nU.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Canada.\nThe Canadian laws and regulations applicable to Baytex and its shareholders may adversely affect its ability to\ntake actions that could be deemed beneficial to Baytex shareholders.\nBecause Baytex is organized under the laws of Alberta, the Ranger shareholders will be subject to\ndifferent corporate protections and requirements than a corporation organized under the laws of a state of\nthe United States. The Baytex By-laws and the Baytex Articles, set forth various rights and obligations that\nare applicable to Baytex as an Alberta corporation. These requirements may limit or otherwise adversely\naffect the ability of Baytex\u2019s shareholders to take actions relative to their ability as Ranger shareholders.\nProvisions of the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada may also have the\neffect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in Baytex\u2019s management. For example, the\nABCA includes provisions that require any shareholder proposal that includes nominations for the election\nof directors to be signed by one or more holders of shares representing in the aggregate not less than 5% of\nthe shares or 5% of the shares of a class of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting to which\nthe proposal is to be presented.\nThe Investment Canada Act requires that a non-Canadian must file an application for review with the\nMinister of Innovation, Science and Industry and obtain approval of the Minister prior to acquiring control\nof a \u201cCanadian business\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act, where prescribed financial\nthresholds are exceeded. As a \u201cCanadian business,\u201d an acquisition of control of Baytex shares by a non-\nCanadian would be subject to a suspensory review if these thresholds are exceeded. Furthermore,\nacquisitions of Baytex common shares which exceed certain thresholds may be subject to suspensory review\nunder the Competition Act (Canada) (the \u201cCompetition Act\u201d). This legislation permits the Commissioner of\nCompetition appointed under the Competition Act to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or\nindirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in Baytex.\nResales of Baytex common shares following the Merger Transactions may cause the market value of Baytex\ncommon shares to decline.\nBased on the number of shares of Ranger common stock and Ranger equity awards outstanding as of\nMay 17, 2023, Baytex expects to issue or reserve for issuance an aggregate of approximately 323,323,741\nBaytex common shares at the merger effective time in connection with the Merger Transactions. The\nissuance of these new Baytex common shares could have the effect of depressing the market value for the\nBaytex common shares. The increase in the number of Baytex common shares may lead to sales of such\nBaytex common shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the\nmarket for, and the market value of, Baytex common shares.\nThe market value of Baytex common shares may decline as a result of the combination of Baytex and Ranger.\nThe market value of the Baytex common shares may decline as a result of the combination of Baytex and\nRanger if, among other things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected growth in\n26 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrevenues and earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of\nRanger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s businesses are not realized or if costs related to the Merger Transactions are greater\nthan expected. The market value of the Baytex common shares also may decline if the combined company\ndoes not achieve the perceived benefits of the combination as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the\nmarket or if the effect of the combination on the combined company\u2019s financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. In addition,\nsome Ranger shareholders may decide not to continue to hold the Baytex common shares they receive as a\nresult of the Merger Transactions, and any such sales of Baytex common shares could have the effect of\ndepressing their market price. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse\neffect on the market for, or liquidity of, Baytex common shares, regardless of Baytex\u2019s actual operating\nperformance after the combination of Baytex and Ranger.\nCurrent Baytex and Ranger shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger\nTransactions and will have less input into the management of the combined company.\nBased on the number of shares of Ranger common stock, shares of Ranger Class A common stock\nissuable pursuant to Ranger equity awards and Baytex common shares, in each case, outstanding on May\n17, 2023, at the merger effective time, former Ranger shareholders and holders of Ranger\u2019s share-based\nawards, collectively, are expected to own approximately 37% of the outstanding Baytex common shares,\nincluding for these purposes, the shares underlying the Converted Baytex TRSU awards. See the section of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Ranger Equity Awards,\u201d on\npage 123 for a more detailed explanation. Consequently, current Baytex shareholders in the aggregate will\nhave less input into the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over\nthe management and policies of Baytex, and Ranger shareholders in the aggregate will have significantly less\ninput into the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the\nmanagement and policies of Ranger.\nRanger and Baytex may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial\ncosts and may delay or prevent the Merger Transactions from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have\nentered into business combination transactions. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against\nthese claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a\nplaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger Transactions, then\nthat injunction may delay or prevent the Merger Transactions from being completed.\nPurported stockholders of Ranger and Baytex have sent letters to Ranger and Baytex alleging that the\nproxy statement/prospectus contains materially misleading and incomplete statements and demanding that\nRanger and Baytex provide supplemental disclosures under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and\nRule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Ranger and Baytex believe that the allegations in the demand letters are\nwithout merit. Additional demands or lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger Transactions may be received or filed in the future, which may seek (among other relief) to enjoin the\nMerger Transactions. Absent new or different allegations that are material or a disclosure obligation under\nU.S. federal securities laws, Ranger and Baytex will not necessarily disclose such additional demands or\ncomplaints.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined\ncompany\u2019s business and operations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from shareholders, customers, suppliers,\nconsumers and other third parties due to the combination of Baytex\u2019s business and Ranger\u2019s business. Such\nlitigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations or may\ncause disruptions to the combined company\u2019s operations.\nBaytex and Ranger may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in\nlight of the combination of Baytex and Ranger.\nBaytex\u2019s success after closing the Merger Transactions will depend in part on the ability of Baytex to\nretain key executives and other employees with critical skills and knowledge which are crucial for the\n27 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncombined company to achieve key milestones and synergy realization. Uncertainty about the effect of the\nMerger Transactions on Baytex and Ranger employees may have an adverse effect on each of Baytex and\nRanger separately and consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair Baytex\u2019s and/or\nRanger\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly\nchallenging during the pendency of the Merger Transactions, as employees of Baytex and Ranger may\nexperience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined company.\nAdditionally, Ranger\u2019s officers and employees may hold shares of Ranger Class A common stock, and, if\nthe Merger Transactions close, these officers and employees will be entitled to the merger consideration in\nrespect of such shares of Ranger Class A common stock.\nFurthermore, if key employees of Baytex or Ranger depart or are at risk of departing, including because\nof issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become\nemployees of the combined company, Baytex may have to incur significant costs in retaining such\nindividuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose\nsignificant expertise and talent, and the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the\nMerger Transactions may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the combined\ncompany will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that Baytex and Ranger have been\nable to attract or retain employees in the past.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Ranger to pursue alternatives to the\nMerger Transactions and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Ranger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Ranger to sell its business to\na party other than Baytex. These provisions include a general prohibition on Ranger soliciting any\ncompeting proposal. Further, there are only limited circumstances in which Ranger may terminate the Merger\nAgreement to accept a competing proposal and limited exceptions to Ranger\u2019s agreement that the Ranger\nboard will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Baytex the recommendation the Ranger board in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Ranger board makes an adverse\nrecommendation change and Baytex terminates the Merger Agreement as a result thereof, then Ranger will be\nrequired to pay to Baytex a termination payment of $60.0 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo\nSolicitation\u037e Changes in Recommendation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger\nAgreement,\u201d on pages 124 and 140, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.\nAdditionally, the Class B Holders, representing approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of Ranger\ncommon stock, have agreed, except in limited circumstances, to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and\nthe Merger Transactions. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger\npartner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of Ranger or pursuing an\nalternative transaction with Ranger either from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if a third-\nparty acquiror were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price than the per share price\nproposed to be received in the company merger.\nIf a competing proposal to acquire Ranger or Baytex is made, consummation of the Merger Transactions may be\ndelayed or impeded.\nIf a competing proposal to acquire Ranger or Baytex is made, the attention of Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s\nrespective management may be diverted away from the Merger Transactions, which may delay or impede\nconsummation of the Merger Transactions. Matters related to such competing proposal, including any\npotential related litigation, may require commitments of time and resources of both parties and their\nrespective representatives, which could otherwise have been devoted to the Merger Transactions.\nThe financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Ranger Financial Information\u201d on page 68 were based on assumptions of,\nand information available to, the management team of Ranger when prepared and these estimates and\nassumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Ranger and may not be\nrealized.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nFactors\u201d section and the events or circumstances described under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements,\u201d will be important in determining the combined company\u2019s future results. As a\nresult of these contingencies, actual future results may vary materially from the estimates. In view of these\nuncertainties, the inclusion of financial estimates in this proxy statement/prospectus is not and should not\nbe viewed as a representation that the forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Ranger Financial Information\u201d on page 68 were based on assumptions that\nwere not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and such financial estimates were not prepared with\na view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants or any other regulatory or professional body. Further, any forward- looking statement speaks\nonly as of the date on which it is made, and Ranger and Baytex do not undertake any obligation, other than\nas required by applicable law, to update the financial estimates in this proxy statement/prospectus to reflect\nevents or circumstances after the date those financial estimates were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of\nanticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The Ranger prospective financial information included\nin this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Ranger\u2019s management.\nSee \u201cThe Merger - Certain Unaudited Prospective Ranger Financial Information\u201d on page 68 for more\ninformation. Grant Thornton LLP and KPMG LLP have not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied\nagreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and,\naccordingly, Grant Thornton LLP and KPMG LLP do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance\nwith respect thereto. The Grant Thornton LLP and KPMG LLP reports incorporated by reference in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus relate to Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s previously issued audited financial statements as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Such reports do not extend to the prospective\nfinancial information and should not be read to do so.\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of Baytex common shares and any\ndividends.\nThe Baytex common shares are quoted in Canadian dollars on the TSX and in U.S. dollars on the NYSE.\nDividends in respect of Baytex common shares, if any, are anticipated to be declared in Canadian dollars.\nBaytex\u2019s financial statements are prepared in Canadian dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the\nU.S. dollar and Canadian dollar will affect, among other matters, the U.S. dollar value of Baytex common\nshares, whether or not traded on the TSX or the NYSE, and of any dividends in respect of such shares.\nRanger shareholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the proposed company merger.\nBecause the Ranger Class A common stock will be listed on the NASDAQ as of the Ranger Record Date\nfor the Ranger special meeting and Ranger shareholders are solely receiving Baytex common shares (and\nsuch shares are listed on NYSE as of the Ranger Record Date) and cash (including cash in lieu of fractions\nthereof) as merger consideration in exchange for their Ranger Class A common stock, no appraisal rights are\navailable under Article 15 of the VSCA with respect to the company merger or the other Merger Transactions.\nUpon completion of the company merger, Ranger shareholders will become Baytex shareholders, and the market\nprice of Baytex common shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected\nRanger.\nUpon completion of the company merger, Ranger shareholders will become Baytex shareholders.\nBaytex\u2019s business differs from Ranger\u2019s, and accordingly, the results of operations of Baytex will be affected\nby some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Ranger. For a\ndiscussion of the businesses of Ranger and Baytex and of some important factors to consider in connection\nwith those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and\nreferred to in the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s Business.\nYou should read and consider the risk factors specific to Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s business that will also\naffect the combined company following the Merger Transactions. These risks are described in Ranger\u2019s\n29 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nfiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, Baytex\u2019s Annual Report on Form 40-F for the year ended December 31,\n2022, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC which are incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, and in other documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. See the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information,\u201d on page 196\nfor the location of information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nAn investment in common shares of Baytex involves a number of risks disclosed in such risk factors as\nwell as those set forth below.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity,\ndefaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect\nBaytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s current and projected business operations and their financial condition and results of\noperations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that\naffect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry\nor the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other\nsimilar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Although neither\nBaytex nor Ranger has deposit accounts with, or is a borrower under or party to any material letter of credit\nor any other similar instruments with any financial institution currently in receivership, if any of their lenders\nor counterparties to such instruments were to be placed into receivership, they may be unable to access\nsuch funds. In addition, if any of Baytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s suppliers or other parties with whom they conduct\nbusiness are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a\nfinancial institution, such parties\u2019 ability to pay their obligations to Baytex or Ranger or to enter into new\ncommercial arrangements requiring additional payments to Baytex or Ranger could be adversely affected. In\nthis regard, counterparties to institutions that have entered receivership or experienced liquidity shortages,\nmay experience direct impacts from the closure of financial institutions and uncertainty remains over liquidity\nconcerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during\nthe 2008-2010 financial crisis.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously\nissued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25\nbillion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial\ninstitutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for\ncustomer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may exceed\nthe capacity of such program. Additionally, Baytex and Ranger maintain cash balances at third-party\nfinancial institutions in excess of the FDIC standard insurance limits, and there is no guarantee that the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the\nfuture in the event of the closure of such banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely\nfashion.\nAccess to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance the Merger\nTransactions or Baytex\u2019s post-closing business operations could be significantly impaired by the foregoing\nfactors that affect Baytex, any financial institutions with which Baytex enters into credit agreements or\narrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include,\namong others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under\nvarious types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the\nfinancial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for\ncompanies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial\nservices industry companies with which Baytex or Ranger have financial or business relationships, but could\nalso include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally.\nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of\nmaterial and adverse impacts on Baytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s current and projected business operations and\nBaytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but may not be\nlimited to, the following:\n30 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndelayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other\nfinancial assets\u037e\ninability to enter into credit facilities or other working capital resources\u037e\npotential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require Baytex and Ranger to maintain letters\nof credit or other credit support arrangements\u037e or\ntermination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds\nsubject to cash management arrangements.\nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less\nfavorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and\noperating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it\nmore difficult for Baytex and Ranger to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in\navailable funding or access to cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact\nBaytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s ability to meet operating expenses or other obligations, financial or otherwise, result\nin breaches of Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s financial and/or contractual obligations, or result in violations of\nfederal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors\ndescribed above or other related or similar factors, could have material adverse impacts on Baytex\u2019s and\nRanger\u2019s liquidity and their current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results\nof operations.\nIn addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry\ncould lead to losses or defaults by Baytex\u2019s or Ranger\u2019s partners, vendors or suppliers, which in turn, could\nhave a material adverse effect on Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s current and/or projected business operations and\nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, a partner may fail to make payments when due,\ndefault under their agreements with Baytex or Ranger, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, or a supplier\nmay determine that it will no longer deal with Baytex and Ranger as a customer. In addition, a vendor or\nsupplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors\nthat could result in material adverse impacts on Baytex and Ranger, including but not limited to delayed\naccess or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities\ninvolving a troubled or failed financial institution. The bankruptcy or insolvency of any partner, vendor or\nsupplier, or the failure of any partner to make payments when due, or any breach or default by a partner,\nvendor or supplier, or the loss of any significant supplier relationships, could cause Baytex and Ranger to\nsuffer material losses and may have a material adverse impact on their business.\nThe additional indebtedness that Baytex expects to incur in connection with the Merger Transactions could\nadversely affect Baytex\u2019s financial position, including by decreasing its business flexibility or adversely affecting its\nability to satisfy its debt obligations or achieve its desired credit ratings.\nBaytex\u2019s consolidated borrowings were approximately US$0.7 billion as of March 31, 2023. Baytex has\nalready incurred US$800 million of debt, and expects to incur an additional approximately US$0.4 billion of\ndebt in connection with the Merger Transactions, as a result of obtaining financing to complete the Merger\nTransactions and to refinance debt assumed in the Merger Transactions. Baytex\u2019s pro forma borrowings as\nat March 31, 2023, if the acquisition of Ranger had been completed on that same date, would have been\napproximately US$1.9 billion, of which US$0.7 billion would have been at variable rates of interest. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, Baytex would have had US$0.6 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Baytex new\nbank credit facility after giving pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions and the expected financing.\nThis increased level of borrowings could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Baytex\u2019s\nliquidity and the combined company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nAlso, the combined company\u2019s ability to make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness will\ndepend upon its future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial and business\nconditions, sufficient cash flow, the implementation of the integration with Ranger and other factors\naffecting its operations, many of which will be beyond the combined company\u2019s control.\nAccordingly, the amount of cash required to service the combined company\u2019s increased borrowing\nlevels after the combination of Baytex and Ranger, and thus the demands on the combined company\u2019s cash\nresources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service Baytex\u2019s borrowings prior to\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe combination. If Baytex completes the acquisition of Ranger and obtains control of Ranger but does not\nachieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the\ncombined company does not meet current expectations, then Baytex\u2019s ability to service its indebtedness may\nbe adversely impacted. The increased levels of borrowings after the combination of Baytex and Ranger could\nalso reduce funds available for the combined company\u2019s investments including capital expenditures and\nother activities, and the payment of dividends and may create competitive disadvantages for the combined\ncompany relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nThe agreements that will govern Baytex\u2019s indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the\nMerger Transactions may contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain\ncustomary exceptions, restrict the combined company\u2019s ability to, among other things, create liens over its\nproperty, change its line of business and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey\ncertain of its assets to another person. In addition, some of the agreements that will govern the combined\ncompany\u2019s new debt financings may contain financial covenants that will require it to maintain certain\nfinancial ratios. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company\u2019s control could affect\nits ability to comply with these covenants and failure to comply with them could result in an event of default,\nwhich, if not cured or waived, could accelerate repayment obligations. Under these circumstances, the\ncombined company may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations.\nIn conjunction with the Merger Transactions, Baytex may issue debt securities that will be rated by\nvarious credit rating agencies. Some of these debt securities\u2019 credit ratings may be publicly disclosed and\ncould impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, Baytex\u2019s cost of capital.\nBaytex\u2019s credit ratings reflect each credit rating organization\u2019s opinion of Baytex\u2019s financial and business\nstrength, operating performance and ability to meet Baytex\u2019s debt obligations. If any of Baytex\u2019s future credit\nratings are less favorable than anticipated or reduced, Baytex may not be able to sell additional debt\nsecurities, borrow money or refinance its debt, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms\nand conditions that might be available if Baytex\u2019s current credit ratings are maintained.\nThe combined company may be subject to new or additional income or other tax levies that may fluctuate and\nimpact its results of operations and cash flows.\nThe combined company and its subsidiaries will be subject to income and other taxes in Canada,the\nUnited States and other jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof or tax rates in the\njurisdictions in which the combined company and its subsidiaries are organized or do business could\nadversely affect the combined company\u2019s results from operations, returns to shareholders, and cash flow.\nThe combined company\u2019s effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in\ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation. While Baytex and Ranger believe that they and their subsidiaries\nare in compliance with current prevailing tax laws and requirements, one or more taxing jurisdictions could\nseek to impose incremental or new taxes, and Baytex, Ranger and their subsidiaries could be subject to\nassessment, reassessment, audit, investigation, inquiry or judicial or administrative proceedings by any such\ntaxing jurisdiction. The timing or impacts of any such assessment, reassessment, audit, investigation, inquiry\nor judicial or administrative proceedings or any future changes in tax laws, including the impacts of\nproposed regulations, cannot be predicted. Any adverse tax developments, including legislative changes,\njudicial holdings, or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on the results of\noperations, financial condition, and cash flows of the combined company.\nChanges in tax laws or the interpretation thereof or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may increase\nthe combined company\u2019s future tax liability and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s operations and cash\nflows.\nFrom time to time, U.S. federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into\nlaw, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax\nprovisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. Such\nlegislative changes have included, but have not been limited to, (i) the elimination of the percentage\ndepletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible\ndrilling and development costs, (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and\ngeophysical expenditures, (iv) the\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nelimination of certain other tax deductions and relief previously available to oil and natural gas companies,\nand (v) an increase in the U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations. For example, the Biden\nAdministration\u2019s budget proposal released on March 9, 2023, includes an increase in the U.S. federal income\ntax rate applicable to corporations from 21% to 28% and an increase in the excise tax on stock repurchases,\noriginally enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cstock buyback tax\u201d), from 1% to 4%. In\naddition, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have released preliminary guidance that would potentially\ncause Baytex\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries to be subject to the stock buyback tax with respect to any share\nrepurchases made by Baytex under certain circumstances. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will\nbe enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which the\ncombined company will operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and\noil extraction. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in U.S.\nfederal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on natural gas and oil extraction\ncould increase the combined company\u2019s future tax liability and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s\noperations and cash flows.\nThe combined company may be subject to additional U.S. federal income tax as a result of the corporate alternative\nminimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d).\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes, among other things, the CAMT. Under the CAMT, a 15%\nminimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of \u201capplicable corporations\u201d in taxable\nyears beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT generally treats a U.S. corporation as an applicable\ncorporation in any taxable year following a taxable year in which (i) the \u201caverage annual adjusted financial\nstatement income\u201d of the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates exceeds $1 billion for a\nspecified three taxable year period and (ii) in the case of a foreign-parented multinational group such as the\ncombined company, such financial statement income of the corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries\nand affiliates exceeds $100 million for such period. Based on Baytex\u2019s current interpretation of the rules\nrelated to the CAMT, as well as a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions,\nBaytex does not expect the combined company to be subject to the CAMT as a result of the company\nmerger. However, the combined company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries may be treated as applicable corporations in\nfuture years. Further, although the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS are expected to release\nregulations and interpretive guidance relating to the CAMT, there is currently limited guidance on the\napplication of the CAMT rules. The application of the CAMT rules is further complicated in the context of\ncombining the financial statement income results of each of Baytex and Ranger as a result of the company\nmerger. Accordingly, Baytex\u2019s current expectations regarding the applicability of the CAMT are subject to a\nnumber of uncertainties, and its intended position is not free from doubt. Any significant variance from\nBaytex\u2019s current interpretation of the CAMT rules could result in a change in the analysis of the application\nof the CAMT to the combined company and its impact on the combined company\u2019s operations and cash\nflows.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to use Ranger\u2019s existing net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards, acquired in the\ncompany merger, to offset future income subject to U.S. federal income tax will be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of March 31, 2023, Ranger had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $715 million, which\nare subject to various limitations. For example, the use of Ranger\u2019s U.S. federal NOL carryforwards generated\non or after January 1, 2018, is generally limited to 80% of Ranger\u2019s taxable income. Additionally, some of\nRanger\u2019s U.S. federal NOL carryforwards expire between 2032 and 2037 while others have no expiration date.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to utilize U.S. NOL carryforwards to reduce future income subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax will also be subject to various limitations, including under Section 382 of the Code\n(\u201cSection 382\u201d). Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that\nmay be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d  (as\ndetermined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or\ngroups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of such corporation\u2019s stock, have a\ncumulative change in their ownership of more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership\npercentage within a rolling three-year period. As a result of the company merger, Ranger is expected to\nundergo such an ownership change. Accordingly, utilization of Ranger\u2019s NOL carryforwards is expected to\nbe subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, generally determined by multiplying the\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvalue of Ranger\u2019s stock at the time of the company merger by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate in\neffect during the month in which the ownership change occurs, subject to certain adjustments. This\nlimitation is expected to be substantial, and although any unused annual limitation may be carried over to\nlater years, the limitation could result in a portion of Ranger\u2019s NOL carryforwards expiring prior to their\nutilization. In addition, if the combined company becomes subject to the CAMT, such NOLs cannot be used\nto reduce income subject to the CAMT.\nBaytex\u2019s operations are subject to numerous stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that\nmay expose Baytex and the combined company to significant costs and liabilities.\nBaytex\u2019s operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, provincial and local\nenvironmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the release, emission or\ndischarge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation\nand disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the health and safety of Baytex\u2019s employees and other\npersons. From time to time, Baytex has been, and in the future may be, issued violations from government\nentities that its operations have failed to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such\nlaws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal\npenalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or\nprohibiting some or all of Baytex\u2019s or the combined company\u2019s operations.\nInvestor sentiment regarding the oil and gas industry may impact Baytex\u2019s access to capital as evolving\nenvironmental, social and governance disclosure standards are attracting increased scrutiny from stakeholders and\ncould lead to more costly policies and practices being implemented and consequently may adversely affect Baytex\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nA number of factors relating to Baytex\u2019s operations, including the impact of oil and natural gas\noperations on the environment, the effects of the use of hydrocarbons on climate change, ecological damage\nrelating to spills of petroleum products during production and transportation, and human rights, could affect\ncertain investors\u2019 sentiments towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result of these\nconcerns, some institutional, retail, and governmental investors have announced that they are no longer\nwilling to fund or invest in companies in the oil and natural gas industry, or are reducing the amount thereof\nover time. Any reduction in the investor base interested or willing to invest in the oil and natural gas\nindustry may result in limiting Baytex\u2019s access to capital, increasing its cost of capital, and decreasing the\nprice and liquidity of Baytex\u2019s securities. In addition, more stringent regulation with respect to the\nenvironment (including climate change) as well as increased attention to environmental, social, and\ngovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters may result in restrictions on access to capital, both of which could adversely\nimpact Baytex\u2019s ability to develop its reserves.\nIn addition, practices and disclosures relating to ESG matters (including but not limited to climate\nchange and emissions, diversity and inclusion, data security and privacy, ethical sourcing, and water, waste\nand ecological management) are attracting increasing scrutiny by stakeholders. Certain stakeholders are\nrequesting that issuers develop and implement more robust ESG policies and practices, such as emission\nreduction goals and environmental targets. To the extent Baytex announces such goals, they are meant to be\naspirational and Baytex cannot guarantee that it will be able to meet them on the timeline originally estimated\nor at all. Developing and implementing such policies and practices can involve significant costs and require\na significant time commitment from the Baytex board, executive management team, and employees of Baytex\nand are subject to a number of assumptions, uncertainties, and estimates and rely on scenarios or\nprojections that may not prove accurate as a result of factors outside Baytex\u2019s control. In addition, failing to\nimplement the policies and practices, as requested or expected by the Baytex stakeholders, may result in\nsuch investors reducing their investment in Baytex, or not investing in Baytex at all. Baytex\u2019s response to\naddressing ESG matters and any negative perception thereof can also impact Baytex\u2019s reputation, business\nprospects, ability to hire and retain qualified employees, and vulnerability to activist shareholders. Such\nrisks could adversely affect Baytex\u2019s business, future operations, and profitability.\nBaytex\u2019s business operations, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been and may in the\nfuture be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe initial outbreak of COVID-19 negatively impacted the global economy and led to, among other\nthings, reduced global demand for crude oil, disruption of global supply chains, and significant volatility\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand disruption of financial and commodity markets. In response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, many\nstate and local jurisdictions imposed quarantines and restrictions on their residents to control the spread of\nCOVID-19. Such quarantines and restrictions resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and\ndelays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects. During\n2021 and 2022, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines progressed and most government-imposed restrictions\nhave been relaxed or rescinded. While the prices of and demand for crude oil have recovered, further\noutbreaks, or the emergence of new strains of the COVID-19 virus, could result in the reimposition of\ndomestic and international regulations directing individuals to stay at home, limiting travel, requiring facility\nclosures and imposing quarantines. Widespread implementation of these or similar restrictions could result\nin commodity price volatility and reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could materially and\nadversely affect Baytex\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nBaytex may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nInflation in wages, materials, parts, equipment and other costs has the potential to adversely affect\nBaytex\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position by increasing our overall cost structure,\nparticularly if oil and natural gas prices decline or remain stagnant. In addition, the existence of inflation in\nthe economy has and may continue to result in higher interest rates, which could result in higher borrowing\ncosts, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects.\nThe ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect Baytex\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn February 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine and fighting between the two countries\ncontinues. While Baytex has no operations, personnel or assets in either country, the outcome of this\nongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and could lead to further market and other disruptions that\ncould adversely affect Baytex, such as volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices, supply chain constraints\nand disruptions, increased prices for certain raw materials and component parts, instability in financial\nmarkets, higher inflation, changes in currency rates and increases in cyberattacks and espionage. As a result\nof this conflict, governments in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and\nother countries have enacted sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. Such sanctions, and other\nmeasures, as well as existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such\nsanctions, could exacerbate the foregoing risks. Any of these developments could adversely affect Baytex\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nBaytex cannot predict whether it will be able to successfully identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage future\nacquisitions.\nBaytex may, from time to time, seek to expand its business and its operations by acquiring or developing\nadditional businesses or assets in existing or new markets. Baytex expects to realize strategic opportunities\nand other benefits as a result of its acquisitions. However, there can be no assurances as to whether, or to\nwhat extent, such benefits or opportunities will be realized. Baytex cannot predict whether it will be able to\nsuccessfully identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional acquisitions, or successfully integrate\nany acquired business or assets into Baytex\u2019s business, or to adjust to an increased scope of operations as a\nresult of such acquisitions. There is a risk that any future acquisitions could adversely impact Baytex\u2019s\noperations and results.\nBaytex is exposed to foreign currency risks including transaction exposure and translation exposure.\nBaytex reports its financial results to the public in Canadian dollars\u037e however, certain of its revenues\nand expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than Canadian dollars, including, following the\ncompletion of the Merger Transactions, those of Ranger. Most oil prices are quoted in U.S. dollars and the\nprice received by Canadian producers is therefore affected by the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate that\nmay fluctuate over time. A material increase in the value of the Canadian dollar may negatively impact\nBaytex\u2019s revenues. A substantial portion of Baytex\u2019s operations and production will be in the United States\nand, as such, it will be exposed to greater foreign currency risk on both revenues and costs to the extent the\nvalue of the Canadian dollar decreases relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, Baytex is exposed to foreign\n35 \n",

As a result, the value of the merger consideration that Ranger shareholders will\nreceive upon the closing of the Merger Transactions could be greater than, less than or the same as the\nvalue of the merger consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Ranger\nspecial meeting. Accordingly, you are encouraged to obtain current share price quotations for Ranger Class\nA common stock and Baytex common shares before deciding how to vote with respect to the approval of the\nMerger Agreement. Ranger Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cROCC\u201d and\nBaytex common shares trade on the TSX and the NYSE under the symbol \u201cBTE.\u201d The price of Baytex\ncommon shares on the TSX is reported in Canadian dollars.\nBackground of the Merger\nThe Baytex board and Ranger board, in the ordinary course and consistent with their fiduciary duties,\ncontinually evaluate their respective company\u2019s operations and future business prospects with a focus on\ngenerating long-term value by leveraging assets to create efficiencies, growing free cash flow and returning\ncash to shareholders. In connection with such evaluation, the Baytex board, Ranger board and senior\nmanagement teams of both companies also review and assess potential strategic alternatives, including\nmerger and acquisition transactions. As part of such assessment, each senior management team has had\ncontacts with financial and strategic parties, including other public and private exploration and production\ncompanies, and routinely receives presentations from investment banks and other third parties on potential\nmerger and acquisition opportunities.\nThe following is a summary of the events leading up to the signing of the Merger Agreement and the\nkey meetings, negotiations, discussions and actions by and among Baytex, Ranger and their respective\nadvisors that preceded the public announcement of the company merger.\nSince 2014, Baytex has had a large non-operated acreage position in the Eagle Ford and Baytex had from\ntime to time assessed strategic transactions related to this acreage position, including through a transaction\nwith Ranger, which it began to evaluate in September 2022. Baytex commenced review of Ranger and its\nassets as part of its normal course business development activities with these goals in mind.\nOn December 7, 2021, Mr. Darrin Henke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Ranger, and\nMr. Russell T. Kelley, Jr., Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Ranger, met with the\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer of a publicly-traded exploration and production company\nfocused on development in the Permian Basin (\u201cParty A\u201d) to discuss the perceived benefits of a potential\nbusiness combination between the two companies, including potential synergies and operations. On the\nevening of December 8, 2021, Mr. Henke discussed, among other matters, the potential business combination\nwith the Ranger board over dinner and, there being no actionable circumstances at that time, Mr. Henke\nagreed to keep the Ranger board informed of any developments.\nOn January 21, 2022, Party A expressed an interest in a potential business combination with Ranger\nduring a meeting with several members of the Ranger board. Between February and June 2022, Party A and\nRanger\u2019s senior management held several meetings to discuss non-confidential commercial and financial due\ndiligence of each of Ranger and Party A. Ranger\u2019s senior management intermittently reported the results of\nthese meetings to the Ranger board.\nOn January 24, 2022, a publicly-traded oil and natural gas company headquartered in the United States\n(\u201cParty B\u201d), met with a member of the Ranger board and expressed an interest in acquiring Ranger. Between\nFebruary and October 2022, Party B and Ranger\u2019s senior management held several meetings to discuss non-\nconfidential commercial and financial due diligence of each of Ranger and Party B. Ranger\u2019s senior\nmanagement intermittently reported the results of these meetings to the Ranger board.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Ranger began discussions with BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA Securities\u201d)\nregarding strategic opportunities, including a potential sale of Ranger, and Ranger formally engaged BofA\nSecurities for such purposes on December 20, 2022. The Ranger board selected BofA Securities to assist with\nRanger\u2019s evaluation of strategic opportunities based on BofA Securities\u2019 experience in transactions similar to\nthe company merger, BofA Securities\u2019 reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with\nRanger\u2019s business.\n45 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 8, 2022, a publicly traded oil and natural gas exploration and production company (\u201cParty C\u201d)\ncontacted a member of the Ranger board via telephone. The chief executive officer of Party C expressed an\ninterest in a potential business combination with Ranger. After additional discussions between the two\nparties and on June 16, 2022, Party C and Ranger entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate\ndiscussions and the disclosure of information between Party C and Ranger. Ranger\u2019s senior management\nintermittently reported the results of these meetings to the Ranger board.\nOn July 2, 2022, Party A and Ranger entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate\ndiscussions and the disclosure of information between Party A and Ranger.\nOn July 29, 2022, the Ranger board convened via telephone to discuss each of the potential business\ncombinations, including the expression of interest from each of Party A, Party B, and Party C, none of which\nwere supported by indicative pricing or any other term. The Ranger board discussed the perceived merits of\neach potential counterparty based on Ranger\u2019s senior management\u2019s reports to date and, there being no\nactionable circumstances at that time, Mr. Henke agreed to keep the Ranger board informed of any\ndevelopments.\nOn October 30, 2022, Ranger received an unsolicited offer from Party A to acquire all of the outstanding\nequity securities of Ranger for $40.14 per share, comprised of $20.00 per share in cash and the remainder in\nParty A common shares. Based on the closing price of Ranger common stock on October 28, 2022, the\nproposed consideration outlined in Party A\u2019s proposal represented no premium above Ranger\u2019s trading price\nat that time.\nOn October 31, 2022, the Ranger board held a meeting. At this meeting, the Ranger board discussed the\nstrategic options available to Ranger, including remaining as a standalone company, maximizing return of\ncapital to its shareholders and commencing a sale process for Ranger. After discussion and based on the\ninterest shown from various parties during 2022, the Ranger board directed members of Ranger\u2019s senior\nmanagement to commence a bidder outreach process, with the assistance of BofA Securities in order to\nevaluate third-party interest in an acquisition of Ranger. Based on the unsolicited offer from Party A, as well\nas the Ranger board\u2019s consideration of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the Eagle Ford basin, the\nRanger board believed that a sale of the company may have the potential to enhance shareholder value as\ncompared to continuing to remain a standalone company. Over the course of the following weeks, members\nof Ranger\u2019s senior management initiated and prepared for the sale process, with the assistance of BofA\nSecurities and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cK&E\u201d).\nFrom November 3, 2022 through the end of the year, BofA Securities contacted over 24 potential\nacquirors. As a result of these discussions, Ranger executed non-disclosure agreements with 12 potential\nacquirors, including Party B, Party D, Party E, Party F, Party I and Party J, each of which is a publicly traded\noil and natural gas exploration and production company, and Party G, an energy and infrastructure private\nequity firm. Party C was contacted on behalf of Ranger by representatives of BofA Securities regarding the\nsale process, but Party C declined to participate.\nBeginning on November 16, 2022, Ranger provided confidential information to each of the parties that\nhad executed a non-disclosure agreement for evaluation in a virtual data room. Thereafter, certain parties\nasked, and Ranger\u2019s senior management responded to, various supplemental due diligence requests.\nIn the middle of November 2022, Baytex became aware of the Ranger sales process and made contact\nwith Ranger to express its interest.\nOn November 18, 2022, Baytex and Ranger entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate Baytex\u2019s\nreview of Ranger\u2019s confidential information. During the period between November 28, 2022 and December 2,\n2022, representatives of BofA Securities and Ranger hosted management presentations, in person or via\nvideoconference, with each of Baytex, Party A, Party B, Party D, Party E, Party F, Party G, Party H and Party\nI. During the course of this process, additional diligence material was uploaded to the virtual data room.\nParties were also given the opportunity to ask supplemental diligence questions of Ranger\u2019s senior\nmanagement regarding the diligence materials for the purpose of such bidder\u2019s evaluation.\nOn December 2, 2022, Ranger provided to each potential bidder a letter setting forth in greater detail the\nprocedures for the sale process and requesting that initial indications of interest be submitted by December\n15, 2022 should such bidder wish to continue exploring a potential acquisition of Ranger.\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 5, 2022, an initial draft of the Merger Agreement was uploaded by Ranger to the virtual\ndata room for participants\u2019 review and comment. The draft Merger Agreement included a note that the final\nstructure of the potential transaction, as well as certain of the deal protection provisions, may be subject to\nchange based on the identity of the potential buyer, the form, nature and mix of consideration being offered\nby such potential buyer and other factors as determined by the Ranger board.\nAlso on December 5, 2022, Ranger formally engaged K&E to act as its outside legal counsel in\nconnection with Ranger\u2019s consideration of a potential sale.\nOn December 7, 2022, the Baytex board held a meeting. At this meeting, Baytex\u2019s senior management\ndiscussed with the Baytex board various merger, acquisition and divestment opportunities and their merits\nand provided a presentation to the Baytex board regarding a potential transaction with Ranger. The Baytex\nboard authorized management to continue their evaluation of Ranger and following the meeting, Baytex\nbegan working with McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (\u201cMcDaniel & Associates\u201d) to independently\nassess the Ranger reserves in accordance with NI 51-101.\nThroughout December 2022, BofA Securities sent daily updates to Ranger\u2019s senior management\nsummarizing each process participant\u2019s engagement, as indicated by due diligence questions asked,\ninteraction with Ranger\u2019s confidential information in the virtual data room, and whether the process\nparticipant had requested a telephone call to discuss the financial model. By December 12, 2022, the active\nprocess participants consisted of Baytex and Party A, Party B, Party D and Party J.\nOn December 6, 2022, Ranger began discussions with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) in\nconnection with a potential sale of Ranger, and Ranger formally engaged Wells Fargo for such purposes on\nFebruary 8, 2023. Wells Fargo provided Ranger with analyses of potential acquirors of Ranger, including the\nselected potential counterparties\u2019 financial strength and the advantages and considerations of pursuing a\ncombination with such parties.\nIn advance of the December 15, 2022 deadline date for submission of indications of interest,\nmanagement of Baytex, with the support of CIBC Capital Markets, continued its due diligence review in\nregards to a possible transaction with Ranger. As part of this due diligence review, over the course of several\nmeetings and discussions, CIBC Capital Markets provided Baytex management with a detailed review of the\nstrategic benefits and considerations for a transaction with Ranger, including an assessment of financial\nperformance, asset quality and strategic fit. Following completion of such due diligence review, management\nof Baytex, with the assistance of CIBC Capital Markets, drafted a non-binding proposal, which outlined the\nprincipal business terms under which Baytex was interested in proceeding with further due diligence,\nanalysis and negotiations with respect to a possible transaction with Ranger.\nOn December 14, 2022, the Baytex board held a meeting at which senior management made a\npresentation to the Baytex board regarding a potential transaction with Ranger and its intention to submit a\nnon-binding proposal for an all-share transaction (the \u201cInitial Baytex Proposal\u201d). Members of management\nleft for a portion of the meeting so that an in camera session of the independent directors could be held to\nallow the independent directors to deliberate on the business of the meeting and any other matters in the\nabsence of management.\nOn December 15, 2022, the previously expressed deadline for submission of indications of interest,\nRanger received indications of interest from Baytex, Party A and Party B. The Initial Baytex Proposal\nprovided for an all-stock transaction at an exchange ratio of 9.3 Baytex common shares for each share of\nRanger common stock, which represented an approximate 10% premium to both the 5-day and 20-day volume\nweighted average prices of the Ranger Class A common stock and Baytex common shares. Each of Party A\u2019s\nand Party B\u2019s proposals specified an at-the-market transaction, with Party B\u2019s consideration comprised of\n30% cash and 70% of its common stock and Party A\u2019s consideration based on the 7-day volume weighted\naverage price of Ranger\u2019s Class A common stock and comprised of a cash and stock mix allocated at the\nRanger shareholder\u2019s election, subject to a cash cap. Party D maintained that it was continuing to evaluate a\npotential transaction through December 15, 2022, but did not submit a proposal. At or prior to the previously\nexpressed deadline for submission of indications of interest, Party J indicated to representatives of BofA\nSecurities that such party was no longer interested in participating in the sale process.\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 19, 2022, the Ranger board held a meeting at which members of Ranger\u2019s senior\nmanagement, BofA Securities and K&E were also present. The Ranger board was provided with, and during\nthe meeting representatives of BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, updated information on the\nRanger Class A common stock price, the market conditions facing Ranger and other relevant information,\nincluding a summary of the non-binding proposals submitted by Baytex, Party A and Party B, and BofA\nSecurities\u2019 analysis of the implied value of each proposal on a fully-diluted basis, price protection for the\nRanger shareholders and transactability of each counterparty, including as to certainty of closing,\nanticipated regulatory approvals and outstanding legal and financial due diligence. The Ranger board\ndiscussed informing Baytex and Party B that they would need to increase their valuation in order to continue\nin the process and the advisability of ceasing negotiations with Party A because the offer implied a discount\nof 4.6% to the closing price of Ranger\u2019s Class A common stock on December 15, 2022. Promptly following the\nmeeting of the Ranger board, and consistent with the Ranger board\u2019s instructions, representatives of BofA\nSecurities informed Party A that it had been eliminated from the process and informed each of Baytex and\nParty B that it should consider increasing the consideration reflected in its proposal. Thereafter, Party B\ninformed representatives of BofA Securities that it was declining to continue in the process as Party B was\nunwilling to increase its consideration.\nBetween December 19, 2022 and January 5, 2023, representatives of Baytex, including Mr. Eric Greager,\nBaytex\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, CIBC Capital Markets, and BofA Securities convened via\nconference calls to discuss economic terms of a potential transaction that the Ranger board would be willing\nto transact on, including whether Baytex was amenable to paying a portion of the consideration in cash in\norder to provide immediate and certain value to Ranger\u2019s shareholders.\nOn December 21, 2022, Baytex submitted an update to the Initial Baytex Proposal reflecting an implied\nexchange ratio of 10.5 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with 80% of such\nconsideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 20% payable in cash. Based on the\nclosing price of Baytex common shares on December 20, 2022, the proposed consideration outlined in\nBaytex\u2019s proposal update represented 8.4 Baytex common shares for each share of Ranger Class A common\nstock and $8.72 in cash.\nOn December 27, 2022, Baytex and Ranger entered into a second confidentiality agreement on\nsubstantially similar terms as the November 18, 2022 confidentiality agreement, under which Baytex would be\nthe disclosing party in order to facilitate Ranger\u2019s review of Baytex\u2019s confidential information in light of the\nexpectation that Baytex would issue Baytex common shares as consideration in the potential transaction.\nOn January 5, 2023, Mr. Greager indicated to Mr. Geiser that the Baytex board may be willing to consider\nthat a greater portion of the merger consideration be paid in cash.\nThe next day, on January 6, 2023, Messrs. Edward Geiser, Chairman of the Ranger board, and Darrin\nHenke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Ranger, authorized BofA Securities to send, and\nBofA Securities so sent, on behalf of the Ranger board a counteroffer to Mr. Greager. The counteroffer\nspecified an implied exchange ratio of 10.8 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock, with\n75% of such consideration payable in Baytex common shares and the remaining 25% payable in cash.

The Ranger board considered the attractive value and\nnature of the consideration to be received in the company merger by Ranger shareholders, including:\nthe fact that the share consideration allows Ranger shareholders to participate in the value of the\ncombined company, including expected future free cash flow, which the Ranger board viewed as an\nimportant opportunity for Ranger shareholders should they determine to retain the Baytex common\nshares they would receive as share consideration in the company merger, while the cash\nconsideration provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to the Company\u2019s shareholders\u037e\nthe fact that, based on the closing price of Baytex common shares of $5.74 CAD on February 24, 2023\n(the last trading day prior to the date of Ranger board\u2019s approval of the company merger), the Merger\nConsideration represented an implied value of $44.36 per share of Ranger common stock, a premium of\n8.9% to the closing price of the shares of Ranger\u2019s Class A common stock as of February 24, 2023\u037e\nthe Ranger board\u2019s belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Baytex, that 7.49 Baytex\ncommon shares and $13.31 in cash was the highest price Baytex would be willing to pay and that\nBaytex would not be willing to increase the amount of either the share consideration or cash\nconsideration\u037e\nthe fact that the Ranger shareholders immediately prior to the company merger would own\napproximately 37% of the Baytex common shares immediately following the closing of the company\nmerger\u037e and\nthe fact that the share consideration provides for a fixed number of Baytex common shares which\noffers Ranger shareholders the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price of Baytex\ncommon shares before the closing of the company merger.\nBenefits of a Combined Company. The belief of the Ranger board that the combined company after the\ncompany merger would be well positioned to achieve future free cash flow growth and generate superior\nreturns for Ranger\u2019s former shareholders, including as a result of:\nthe uplift in the combined company\u2019s ability to realize additional annualized savings from synergies\nand additional tax savings from the step-up in tax basis resulting from the Merger Transactions\u037e\nan improved cost of capital due to enhanced scale, increased liquidity and reduced volatility relative\nto standalone Ranger\u037e\nthe talent of certain Ranger employees (including certain senior management members) who are\nexpected to remain with the combined company, adding valuable expertise and experience and in-\ndepth familiarity with the combined company\u2019s U.S. assets, which will enhance the likelihood of\nrealizing the strategic benefits expected to derive from the company merger\u037e and\nthe quality and experience of the Baytex board members, who are expected to remain on the combined\ncompany board, and the fact that two board members from the current Ranger board are expected to\njoin the Baytex board of the combined company.\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSuperior Alternative to Continuation of Standalone Ranger. The Ranger board\u2019s consideration of\nRanger\u2019s business, prospects and other strategic opportunities, including:\nthe Ranger board\u2019s understanding of Baytex\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, earnings,\nprospects, competitive position and the nature of the industry in which Baytex competes\u037e\nthe Ranger board\u2019s understanding of the risks, uncertainties and challenges facing Ranger and the\nindustry in which each of Ranger and Baytex compete, including the risks that Ranger would face if it\ncontinued to operate on a standalone basis\u037e and\nthe belief that the risks from industry trends and dynamics could be more effectively mitigated as a\ncombined company.\nAlternative Combination Merger Transactions. The Ranger board considered alternative transactions\nand, following a review of such alternatives with the assistance of Ranger\u2019s management and in consultation\nwith BofA Securities and Wells Fargo, and after taking into account the results of the bidding process\ndescribed in the section titled \u201c- Background of the Merger,\u201d believed that it was unlikely that an alternative\nbidder would consummate a transaction on superior terms and provide Ranger shareholders more valuable\nconsideration than provided in connection with the company merger.\nOther Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Ranger board concluded, after consultation with Ranger\u2019s\nlegal advisors, that the other terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties\u2019\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and conditions to closing, and the circumstances under which the\nMerger Agreement may be terminated, are reasonable.\nOpportunity to Receive Alternative Acquisition Proposals. The Ranger board considered the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement related to Ranger\u2019s ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals. In this\nregard, the Ranger board considered:\nthe Ranger board\u2019s process for soliciting offers from third parties that were believed to be the most\nable and willing to pay the highest price for Ranger, which included engaging BofA Securities and\nWells Fargo, providing such third parties with an opportunity to conduct due diligence and meetings\nwith members of Ranger\u2019s senior management, as described above in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger - Background of the Merger,\u201d and that no other acquisition proposals on terms superior to\nthe company merger resulted therefrom\u037e\nthe fact that the Class B Holders entered into the Support Agreement, as well as the fact that certain\nvoting obligations under the Support Agreement would no longer be in effect upon Baytex\u2019s failure to\nhold the Baytex annual and special meeting as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger -\nSupport Agreement\u037e\u201d and\nwhile the Merger Agreement contains a termination fee of $60.0 million, representing approximately\n3% of Ranger\u2019s equity value as of the date of the Merger Agreement, that Ranger would be required\nto pay to Baytex in certain circumstances, including if (i) Baytex terminates the Merger Agreement in\nconnection with a change in the Ranger board\u2019s recommendation to shareholders with respect to\napproval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) under certain circumstances, within 12 months\nof termination of the Merger Agreement, Ranger enters into or recommends an agreement in respect\nof any acquisition proposal, or a transaction in respect of any acquisition proposal with respect to\nRanger is consummated, the belief that this fee is reasonable in light of the circumstances and the\noverall terms of the Merger Agreement, consistent with fees in comparable transactions and not\npreclusive of other offers under the circumstances described in the foregoing considerations.\nPost-Merger Corporate Governance. The Ranger board considered that the IRRA provides that Baytex\nshall take appropriate actions to cause to be elected or appointed as a director of the combined company,\nJeffrey E. Wojahn and Tiffany Thom Cepak, or, in the event Mr. Wojahn or Ms. Cepak is unwilling or unable\nto serve as a member of the Baytex board at the time of such appointment, then another member or members\nof the Ranger board that is determined by the Nominating Committee of the Baytex board to be independent\nwith respect to his or her service on the Baytex board.\nFairness Opinion from BofA Securities Inc. The Ranger board considered the financial analyses\nreviewed and discussed with representatives of BofA Securities, as well as the oral opinion of BofA\nSecurities rendered\n56 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto the Ranger board on February 27, 2023, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the\neffect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the various assumptions and limitations described\nin its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of Ranger Class A common stock was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such holders. See below in the section titled \u201cThe Merger - Opinion of BofA\nSecurities, Inc. - Financial Advisor to Ranger.\u201d\nThe Ranger board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other countervailing factors it\ndeemed generally negative or unfavorable in its deliberations concerning the company merger and the\nMerger Agreement, including the following (not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\nFixed Exchange Ratio. The Ranger board considered that, because the merger consideration is based\non a fixed exchange ratio rather than a fixed value, Ranger shareholders bear the risk of a decrease in the\ntrading price of Baytex common shares during the pendency of the company merger\u037e\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Ranger board considered the restrictions on the conduct of Ranger\u2019s\nand its subsidiaries\u2019 businesses during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the\ncompletion of the company merger as set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e\nRisks Associated with the Pendency of the Company Merger. The Ranger board considered the risks\nand contingencies relating to the announcement and pendency of the company merger (including the\nlikelihood of litigation or other opposition brought by or on behalf of Ranger shareholders or Baytex\nshareholders challenging the company merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement) and the risks and costs to Ranger if the company merger is not completed in a timely manner or if\nthe company merger does not close at all, including potential employee attrition, the impact on Ranger\u2019s\nrelationships with third parties and the effect termination of the Merger Agreement may have on the trading\nprice of the Ranger Class A common stock and Ranger\u2019s operating results\u037e\nBaytex Change of Recommendation\u037e Baytex Shareholder Vote. The Ranger board considered the right\nof the Baytex board to change its recommendation to Baytex shareholders in certain circumstances, subject\nto certain conditions (including considering any adjustments to the Merger Agreement proposed by Ranger\nand payment to Ranger of a $100 million termination fee). The Ranger board also considered that, even if the\nMerger Agreement is approved by Ranger shareholders, Baytex shareholders may not approve the Baytex\nshare issuance resolution, which is a closing condition of the company merger\u037e\nOpportunity to Receive Acquisition Proposals\u037e Termination Fees\u037e Expense Reimbursement. The\nRanger board considered the possibility that a third party may be willing to enter into a strategic\ncombination with Ranger on terms more favorable than the company merger, even in light of the fact that\nRanger will not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal. In\nconnection therewith, the Ranger board considered the terms of the Merger Agreement relating to the no-\nshop covenant and termination fees and the potential that such provisions might deter alternative bidders\nthat might have been willing to submit an acquisition proposal to Ranger. The Ranger board also considered\nthat, under specified circumstances, Ranger may be required to pay a termination fee or expenses in the\nevent the Merger Agreement is terminated and the effect this could have on Ranger, including:\nthe possibility that the termination fee could discourage other potential parties from making an\nacquisition proposal, although the Ranger board believed that the termination fee was reasonable in\namount and would not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in making an acquisition\nproposal\u037e\nthe fact that Ranger will generally be obligated to pay its own expenses incident to preparing for and\nentering into and carrying out its obligations under the Merger Transactions if the company merger is\nnot consummated, except in the circumstance where the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of\nthe failure to obtain Baytex shareholder approval of the Baytex share issuance resolution\u037e and\nthe requirement that if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain approval\nof the Ranger Merger Proposal by Ranger shareholders, Ranger would be obligated to reimburse\nBaytex for $20.0 million of its expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement\u037e\n57 \n",

The Ranger board considered that the company merger and the related\ntransactions require regulatory approval to complete such transactions and the risk that the applicable\ngovernmental entities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such\napproval\u037e\nInterests of Certain Ranger Directors and Executive Officers and Other Concerns Related to Conflicts\nor the Potential Appearance of Conflicts. The Ranger board considered that Ranger\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers may have interests in the company merger that may be different from, or in addition to,\nthose of Ranger shareholders generally. For more information about such interests, see the section titled\n\u201cThe Merger -Interests of Ranger\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\u037e\nMerger Costs. The costs associated with the completion of the company merger, including Ranger\nmanagement\u2019s time and energy and potential opportunity cost that will be incurred by the combined\ncompany as a result of the company merger, as described in the section titled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of\nRanger\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger\u201d\u037e and\nOther Risks. The Ranger board considered risks of the type and nature described under the sections\nentitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Ranger board believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the company merger to Ranger\nshareholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger Transactions.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Ranger board in reaching its conclusions and\nrecommendation includes the principal factors considered by the Ranger board but is not intended to be\nexhaustive and may not include all of the factors considered by the Ranger board. In light of the variety of\nfactors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transaction, the\nRanger board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to\nthe specific factors considered in reaching their determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each\nmember of the Ranger board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have\ngiven different weight to different factors. The Ranger board based its recommendation on the totality of the\ninformation presented, including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Ranger\u2019s senior\nmanagement and the Ranger board\u2019s outside legal and financial advisors.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Ranger board to approve the Merger Agreement, holders of\nRanger common stock should be aware that the executive officers and directors of Ranger may have certain\ninterests in the transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Ranger shareholders\ngenerally. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger - Interests of Ranger\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Company Merger\u201d beginning on page 79.\nIt should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Ranger board and certain information\npresented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 39.\nBaytex\u2019s Reasons for the Merger Transactions\nAfter considering such matters as it deemed relevant, the Baytex board unanimously: (i) determined,\nafter receiving legal and financial advice, that the Merger Agreement and the company merger, including the\nissuance of the Baytex common shares pursuant to the company merger, are in the best interests of Baytex\u037e\n(ii) approved the company merger and the entering into of the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement\nand the IRRA\u037e and (iii) recommended that Baytex shareholders vote in favor of the Baytex share issuance\nresolution. The Baytex board unanimously recommends that Baytex shareholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Baytex share\nissuance resolution.\nReasons for and Benefits of the Merger Transactions\nThe anticipated benefits from the Merger Transactions are primarily derived from the financial and\noperational synergies to be realized as a combined entity. The strategic rationale that supported the Baytex\nboard\u2019s approval of the Merger Transactions include the following (not necessarily presented in order of\nrelative importance):\n58 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEnhanced Shareholder Returns. Baytex believes that the Merger Transactions will benefit Baytex\nshareholders by providing additional free cash flow for enhanced shareholder returns due to the\nforecasted increase to free cash flow per share following Closing. Baytex intends to seek to increase\nits direct shareholder return to approximately 50% of free cash flow upon closing, through the\nintroduction of a dividend and an increase in share buybacks. Based on this, following closing of the\nMerger Transactions, Baytex management anticipates recommending to the Baytex board that Baytex\ndeclare and pay a quarterly dividend of $0.0225 per Baytex common share ($0.09 per share annualized)\nrepresenting a dividend yield of approximately 1.6% based on Baytex's closing share price on\nFebruary 24, 2023 of C$5.74 on the TSX.\nBuilds Quality Scale and Significant Operating Capability. The Merger Transactions materially increase\nBaytex\u2019s presence and the scale of its Eagle Ford operations in Texas by adding:\n162,000 net acres in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale, highly concentrated in\nGonzales, Lavaca, Fayette and Dewitt counties which is on-trend with Baytex\u2019s current non-\noperated position just to the southwest in the Karnes Trough.\nEstimated daily average production during the 12 months following the projected closing of the\nMerger Transactions of 67 to 70 Mboe/d (working interest) that is approximately 96% operated\n(72% light oil, 15% NGLs and 13% natural gas).\n254,485 Mboe of proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 (consisting of 169,232 Mbbls of oil,\n44,408 Mbbls of NGLs and 245,069 MMcf of natural gas).\nOn a combined basis, Baytex\u2019s estimated average daily production is forecast to be 155,000 to 160,000\nboe/d (74% oil, 12% NGLs and 14% natural gas) during the 12 months following the projected closing\nof the Merger Transactions. Increasing Baytex\u2019s presence and scale of its Eagle Ford operations in\nTexas is beneficial because Baytex\u2019s current assets in the Eagle Ford are non-operated, and adding\nthe operated assets and capability of Ranger will provide Baytex with significantly greater ability and\nopportunity to optimize its Eagle Ford operations and investments.\nEnhances Drilling Inventory. Baytex estimates Ranger\u2019s acreage would support 741 net undrilled\nlocations representing an inventory life of 12 to 15 years (based on running an average of 2.3 rigs per\nyear), including 523 Lower Eagle Ford locations and 218 additional Upper Eagle Ford and Austin\nChalk locations.\nCreates a Significantly More Resilient Business. On a pro forma basis, Baytex\u2019s operated production\nduring the 12 months following the projected closing of the Merger Transactions increases to\napproximately 82% as compared to 70% in the absence of the Merger Transactions. Baytex also\nbelieves the addition of Ranger\u2019s assets will reduce its asset level free cash flow break-even price by\napproximately US$7/bbl to US$41/bbl WTI. Further, the addition of Ranger\u2019s asset base provides\nincreased exposure to premium U.S. Gulf Coast pricing and increases Baytex\u2019s light oil production in\nthe Eagle Ford to approximately 42% of pro forma production as compared to 18% in the absence of\nthe Merger Transactions, which receives WTI pricing plus approximately US$2/bbl price realizations.\nFinally, Ranger\u2019s acreage is supported by substantial infrastructure in place with low operating and\ntransportation costs.\nMaintains Balance Sheet Strength and Financial Flexibility. As described under \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fDebt\nFinancing,\u201d Baytex has completed the offering of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and it expects to\nenter into the Baytex new bank facility and increase the commitments thereunder to US$1.1 billion and\nto add thereto the US$250 million Baytex term loan, the proceeds of which will be used to pay a\nportion of the cash consideration and refinance Ranger\u2019s and Baytex\u2019s existing indebtedness. Within\n45 days of closing the Merger Transactions, Baytex expects to have approximately 40% of net crude\noil production exposure hedged for the twelve-month period post-closing.\nCommitment to Strong ESG Performance. Baytex believes that the company merger will result in Baytex\nhaving a reduced average greenhouse gas emissions intensity due to the lower greenhouse gas\nintensity Ranger assets being added to the Baytex portfolio.\nDisciplined Leadership and Governance. The combined business will benefit from the experienced\nleadership of the existing Baytex executive team and the Baytex board. Baytex intends to add one\n59 \n",

At closing, Baytex intends to appoint Jeffrey E. Wojahn and Tiffany Thom Cepak to the\nBaytex board. Familiarity with the Ranger assets at the Baytex board and continuity with the Ranger\ntechnical team will allow for the efficient integration of the Ranger assets into the Baytex portfolio.\nOpinion of BofA Securities Inc. - Financial Advisor to Ranger\nRanger has retained BofA Securities to act as Ranger\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the\ncompany merger.

BofA\nSecurities\u2019 opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to\nbe received by holders of Ranger common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any\nconsideration received in connection with the company merger by the holders of any class of securities,\ncreditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to\nthe fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of\nthe officers, directors or employees of any party to the company merger, or class of such persons, relative to\nthe merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative\nmerits of the company merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to\nRanger or in which Ranger might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Ranger to proceed\nwith or effect the company merger. BofA Securities did not express any opinion as to what the value of\nBaytex common shares actually would be when issued or the prices at which Ranger common stock or Baytex\ncommon shares would trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the\ncompany merger. BofA Securities did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and relied, with\nRanger\u2019s consent, upon the assessments of Ranger and its representatives regarding legal, regulatory,\naccounting, tax and similar matters relating to Ranger or the company merger (including the contemplated\nbenefits thereof), as to which matters BofA Securities understood that Ranger had obtained such advice as\nRanger deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or\nrecommendation as to how any shareholder should vote or act in connection with the company merger or\nany other matter. Except as described above, Ranger imposed no other limitations on the investigations made\nor procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.\nBofA Securities\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other\nconditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of,\nthe date of its opinion. BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets had been\nexperiencing unusual volatility and BofA Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects\nof such volatility on Ranger, Baytex or the company merger. It should be understood that subsequent\ndevelopments may affect its opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or\nreaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review\ncommittee of BofA Securities.\nThe discussion set forth below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fSummary of Material Financial\nAnalyses\u201d represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the\nRanger board in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the\ntables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of\nthe financial analyses performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions\nunderlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA\nSecurities.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nRanger Financial Analyses.\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and\nstock market information for Ranger and the following five publicly traded companies in the energy industry:\n62 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Publicly Traded Company\nEnterprise\nValue / \nEstimated \nEBITDA for\n2023\n\u2022 Chord Energy Corporation\n2.8x\n\u2022 Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation\n4.0x\n\u2022 Crescent Energy Company\n3.1x\n\u2022 Vital Energy, Inc.\n2.3x\n\u2022 Silverbow Resources Inc.\n2.0x\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise value of the selected publicly traded\ncompanies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on February 24, 2023, plus total debt,\nissued and outstanding preferred stock and non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents and\nshort-term and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 estimated adjusted\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, as set forth in the\ntable above. Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range of calendar\nyear 2023 EBITDA multiples of 2.3x to 3.3x to Ranger\u2019s calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $832 million, to\ndetermine implied per share equity values. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies\nwere based on research analysts\u2019 estimates available as of February 24, 2023, and estimated financial data of\nRanger were based on the Ranger Forecasts.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for\nRanger, as compared to the implied value of the merger consideration, calculated by adding the $13.31 cash\nconsideration to the implied value of the 7.49 Baytex common shares represented by the share consideration\nbased on the C$5.74 spot price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023 on the TSX, converted into\nUSD at the spot exchange rate of 0.753 (the \u201cImplied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration\u201d), and to the\nImplied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration, discounted to December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of\n11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated range of Ranger\u2019s weighted average cost of capital:\nPer Share Equity Value\nImplied Per Share\nValue of \nMerger Consideration\nImplied Per Share Value of\nMerger \nConsideration, Discounted to \nDecember 31, 2022\n$31.54\u202f-\u202f$51.11\n$44.91\n$44.16\nNo company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ranger. Accordingly, an\nevaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other\nfactors that could affect the public trading or other values of any company to which Ranger was compared.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available,\nfinancial information relating to the following eight selected transactions involving companies in the energy\nindustry between January 1, 2021 and February 27, 2023:\nAcquirer\nTarget / Seller\nTransaction\nValue / \nOne-Year\nForward \nEBITDA\n\u2022 WildFire Energy I LLC\n\u2022 Chesapeake Energy Corporation\n3.2x/3.1x\n\u2022 Marathon Oil Corporation\n\u2022 Ensign Natural Resources LLC\n3.4x\n\u2022 Devon Energy Corporation\n\u2022 Validus Energy Services LLC\n2.0x\n\u2022 SilverBow Resources\n\u2022 Sundance Energy, Inc.\n2.1x\n\u2022 EnCap Investments LP\n\u2022 EP Energy Corp.\n2.8x\n\u2022 Penn Virginia Corporation\n\u2022 Lonestar Resources US Inc.\n3.5x\n\u2022 Penn Virginia Corporation\n\u2022 Lonestar Resources US Inc.\n3.5x\n\u2022 WildFire Energy I LLC\n\u2022 Hawkwood Energy LLC\n-\n\u2022 Validus Energy Services LLC\n\u2022 Ovintiv Inc.\n-\nBofA Securities reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target\ncompany based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s\n63 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\none-year forward estimated EBITDA. Based on its professional judgement and experience, BofA Securities\nthen applied one-year forward EBITDA multiples of 2.5x to 3.5x derived from the selected transactions to\nRanger\u2019s calendar year 2023 estimated EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were\nbased on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Estimated\nfinancial data of Ranger were based on the Ranger Forecasts. This analysis indicated the following\napproximate implied per share equity value reference range for Ranger, as compared to the Implied Per Share\nValue of the Merger Consideration, and to the Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration, discounted\nto December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated range of\nRanger\u2019s weighted average cost of capital:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nfor Ranger\nImplied Per Share\nValue of \nMerger Consideration\nImplied Per Share Value of\nMerger \nConsideration, Discounted to \nDecember 31, 2022\n$33.85\u202f-\u202f$53.42\n$44.91\n$44.16\nNo company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Ranger\nor the company merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.\nRather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies,\nbusiness segments or transactions to which Ranger and the company merger were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a \u201clife of asset\u201d discounted cash flow\nanalysis of Ranger to estimate the present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that\nRanger\u2019s assets were forecasted to generate during Ranger\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2067 based on the\nRanger Forecasts. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using\ndiscount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.9%, which were based on an estimate of Ranger\u2019s weighted average\ncost of capital.\nBofA Securities also estimated the per share impact of the pro forma tax savings due to the Synergies,\nthe incremental utilization of the NOLs and the Step-Up anticipated by the management of Baytex to result\nfrom the Merger Transactions. BofA Securities applied discount rates ranging from 10.6% to 12.9% to such\ntax savings to determine a range of present values for the additional tax shield, which BofA Securities\ndivided by the number of fully-diluted shares of Ranger common stock outstanding to calculate a range of\ntax savings per share of Ranger common stock of $1.93 to $2.17 (the \u201cPro Forma Synergies and Tax\nSavings\u201d). BofA Securities then added the range of Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings to the range of\nimplied standalone per share equity values of Ranger common stock to compute a reference range of pro\nforma implied per share equity values.\nThese analyses indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for\nRanger (i) without and (ii) including the Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings, as compared to the Implied\nPer Share Value of Merger Consideration, and to the Implied Per Share Value of Merger Consideration,\ndiscounted to December 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 11.7%, representing the middle point of the estimated\nrange of Ranger\u2019s weighted average cost of capital:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value\nReference \nRange for Ranger without Pro Forma \nSynergies and Tax Savings\nImplied Per Share\nEquity \nValue Reference Range\nfor \nRanger including Pro\nForma \nSynergies and Tax\nSavings\nImplied Per Share\nValue of \nMerger Consideration\nImplied Per Share\nValue of \nMerger Consideration, \nDiscounted to \nDecember 31, 2022\n$30.92\u202f-\u202f$38.25\n$ 32.85\u202f-\u202f$40.42\n$44.91\n$44.16\nOther Factors.\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019\nmaterial financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes,\nincluding, among other things, the following:\nhistorical trading prices and trading volumes of the Ranger common stock during the 52-week period\nended February 24, 2023, which ranged from $27.31 to $52.78 per share\u037e and\n64 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprice targets for the Ranger common stock in research analyst reports available as of February 24,\n2023, which had a price target range (discounted one year by a 12.8% cost of equity) of $46.05 to\n$49.59 per share.\nBaytex Financial Analyses.\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and\nstock market information for Baytex and the following five publicly traded companies in the energy industry:\nSelected Publicly Traded Company\nEnterprise\nValue / \nEstimated \nEBITDA for\n2023\n\u2022 Vermilion Energy Inc.\n2.3x\n\u2022 Crescent Point Energy Corp.\n3.1x\n\u2022 Enerplus Corporation\n3.3x\n\u2022 Whitecap Resources Inc.\n3.9x\n\u2022 Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd.\n3.5x\nBofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise values of the selected publicly traded\ncompanies calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on February 24, 2023, plus total debt,\nissued and outstanding preferred stock and non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents and\nshort-term and long-term liquid investments, as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA, as set\nforth in the table above. Based on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a range\nof calendar year 2023 EBITDA multiples of 2.8x to 3.8x to Baytex\u2019s calendar year 2023 EBITDA of CAD $1,271\nmillion, as set forth in the Baytex Forecasts, to determine implied per share equity values.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for\nBaytex as compared to the closing trading price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023, in each case,\nas converted into USD at the spot exchange rate of 0.753 as of February 24, 2023:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for Baytex\nClosing Trading Price\nof \nBaytex common\nshares on \nFebruary 24, 2023\n$3.56\u202f-\u202f$5.26\n$4.22\nNo company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Baytex. Accordingly, an\nevaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other\nfactors that could affect the public trading or other values of any company to which Baytex was compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a \u201clife of asset\u201d discounted cash flow\nanalysis of Baytex to estimate the present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that\nBaytex\u2019s assets were forecasted to generate during Baytex\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2050 based on the\nBaytex Forecasts. The cash flows were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.4%, which were based on an estimate of Baytex\u2019s weighted average\ncost of capital.\nThis analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for\nBaytex as compared to the closing price of Baytex common shares on February 24, 2023, in each case, as\nconverted into USD at the spot exchange rate of 0.753 as of February 24, 2023:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for Baytex\nClosing Trading Price\nof \nBaytex common\nshares on \nFebruary 24, 2023\n$3.86\u202f-\u202f$4.20\n$4.22\nOther Factors.\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019\nmaterial financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes,\nincluding, among other things, the following:\n65 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nhistorical trading prices and trading volumes of the Baytex common shares during the 52-week period\nended February 24, 2023, which ranged from $3.92 to $7.12 per share\u037e and\nprice targets for the Baytex common shares in research analyst reports available as of February 24,\n2023, which had a price target range (discounted one year by a 9.0% cost of equity) of $4.72 to $6.07\nper share.\nRelative Financial Analyses.\nImplied Exchange Ratio Analysis.\nUtilizing the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Ranger and Baytex described\nabove by dividing (i) the low endpoint and the high endpoint of the per share equity reference ranges\nderived for Ranger pursuant to the analyses of selected publicly traded companies and discounted cash\nflows (both with and without taking into account the potential financial effect of the Pro Forma Synergies\nand Tax Savings, and subtracting the $13.31 cash consideration) by (ii) the high endpoint and the low\nendpoint of the per share equity reference ranges derived for Baytex pursuant to the analyses of selected\npublicly traded companies and discounted cash flows, respectively, BofA Securities calculated the following\napproximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges, as compared to the amount of the share consideration:\nImplied Exchange Ratio Reference Range\n(Selected \nPublicly Traded Companies)\nImplied Exchange Ratio \nReference Range\n(Discounted \nCash Flows) (without\nsynergies)\nImplied Exchange Ratio \nReference Range\n(Discounted \nCash Flows) (with\nsynergies)\nShare \nConsideration\n3.466x\u202f-\u202f10.608x\n4.189x\u202f-\u202f6.464x\n4.649x\u202f-\u202f7.027x\n7.49x\nHas/Gets Analysis.\nBofA Securities performed a has/gets analysis to calculate the theoretical change in value for the\nholders of Ranger common stock resulting from the company merger based on (i) the pro forma ownership of\nholders of Ranger common stock of Baytex after giving effect to the company merger and (ii) the 100%\nownership by holders of Ranger common stock of Ranger common stock on a standalone basis.\nFor Ranger on a stand-alone basis, BofA Securities used the reference range obtained in its discounted\ncash flow analysis described above under \u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses\u202f-\u202fRanger Financial\nAnalyses\u202f-\u202fDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis.\u201d\nFor Ranger on a pro forma basis, BofA Securities added the high to low reference range of standalone\nimplied equity values of Baytex obtained in its discounted cash flow analysis described above under\n\u201cSummary of Material Financial Analyses\u202f-\u202fBaytex Financial Analyses\u202f-\u202fDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\u201d\nand the present value of the Pro Forma Synergies and Tax Savings to the low to high reference ranges of\nstandalone implied equity values of Ranger, and subtracted the expected amount of incremental net debt\nexpected to be incurred by Baytex in connection with the company merger to calculate a range of implied pro\nforma equity values, then divided the implied pro forma equity values by the estimated number of Baytex\ncommon shares expected to be outstanding on a fully diluted basis following the company merger, to\ndetermine a range of implied pro forma equity values per share, which BofA Securities multiplied by the share\nconsideration of 7.49 Baytex common shares per share of Ranger common stock. BofA Securities then added\nthe cash consideration per share of Ranger common stock of $13.31 to derive a range of implied\nconsideration per share values for the Ranger common stock. The comparison yielded the following:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nfor \nRanger without Pro Forma Synergies and Tax\nSavings\nImplied Per Share Equity Value \nReference Range for Ranger\nwith Pro \nForma Synergies and Tax\nSavings\nIllustrative Implied \nValue Uplift to\nRanger \nCommon Stock\n$30.92\u202f-\u202f$38.25\n$ 39.74\u202f-\u202f$40.71\n28.5%\u202f-\u202f6.4%\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above is a brief summary of the material financial analyses\npresented by BofA Securities to the Ranger board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive\ndescription of all analyses undertaken or the factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its\n66 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of\nthose methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to\npartial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must\nbe considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the\nfactors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses\nand factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been\nreferred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than\nany other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Ranger or Baytex. The\nestimates of the future performance of Ranger or Baytex in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were\nprepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nmerger consideration and were provided to the Ranger board in connection with the delivery of BofA\nSecurities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company\nmight actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.\nAccordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis\ndescribed above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA\nSecurities\u2019 view of the actual values of Ranger or Baytex.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the company merger was determined through\nnegotiations between Ranger and Baytex, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the\nRanger board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Ranger board. As\ndescribed above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the\nRanger board in its evaluation of the proposed company merger and should not be viewed as determinative\nof the views of the Ranger board or Ranger\u2019s management with respect to the company merger or the merger\nconsideration.\nRanger has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the company merger an\naggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately $18 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the\ndelivery of its opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the\ncompany merger. Ranger also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in\nconnection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of\nBofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against\nspecified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full-service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and\nprincipal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment\nmanagement, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide\nrange of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA\nSecurities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that\ninvest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in\nequity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other\nobligations) of Ranger and certain of its affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future\nmay provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Ranger and/or certain\nof its affiliates and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these\nservices, including (i) having acted as financial advisor to Penn Virginia Corporation (now Ranger) in\nconnection with the acquisition of Lonestar Resources US Inc., (ii) having acted as manager for a certain\ndebt offering of a Ranger subsidiary, (iii) having acted or acting as co-lead arranger, joint bookrunner for,\nand/or lender under, certain revolving credit, letters of credit or other facilities of Ranger and/or certain of its\naffiliates, (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management services and products to Ranger\n67 \n",

It was also the intention of the HRC\nCommittee to increase Mr. Greager\u2019s share ownership in Baytex with these share-settled awards.\nFor more information regarding Baytex\u2019s share award incentive plan, see the Baytex Energy Corp. Share\nAward Incentive Plan filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the registration statement of which this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus forms a part.\nFamily Relationship\nThere are no family relationships between any of Baytex\u2019s executive officers and directors or director\nnominees.\nInformation about the current directors and senior management of Ranger can be found in the\ndocuments listed under the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information\u201d on page 196.\nListing of Baytex Common Shares\nThe completion of the Merger Transactions is conditioned upon receipt of conditional listing approval\nfor the listing of the Baytex common shares issuable under the Merger Agreement on the NYSE, subject to\nofficial notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing conditions, prior to the merger effective\ntime.

Wojahn\u202f-\u202fDirector.\nEach of Edward Geiser, Garrett Chunn, Kevin Cumming, Joshua Schmidt, and Timothy Gray were\nappointed to the Ranger board by the Class B Holders. Mr. Geiser has shared voting and investment power\nover the shares held by the Class B Holders.\nRanger Directors to Be Appointed to the Baytex Board\nPursuant to the IRRA, Baytex has agreed to take appropriate actions to cause to be elected or appointed\nas a director of the combined company the Ranger Designees, or, in the event a Ranger Designee is unwilling\nor unable to serve as a member of the Baytex board at the time of such appointment, then another member or\nmembers of the Ranger board that is determined by the Nominating Committee of the Baytex board to be\nindependent with respect to his or her service on the Baytex board will be appointed to the Baytex board to\nfill such vacancy or vacancies on the Baytex board in lieu of Mr. Wojahn and/or the other Ranger Designee,\nas applicable. Any remuneration to be paid to these directors will be consistent with Baytex\u2019s remuneration\npolicy for its directors. The Baytex board is currently comprised of nine directors, and it is expected that\neight of these directors will continue to serve on the Baytex board following completion of the Merger\nTransactions. One of the current Baytex directors has stated that he will not stand for re-election at the\nBaytex annual and special meeting.\nTreatment of Ranger Equity-Based Awards\nEach Ranger TRSU award, other than any Ranger Director TRSU award, and each Ranger PBRSU award,\nin each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time will be converted into\nConverted Baytex TRSU awards at the closing, with the number of Baytex common shares subject to the\nConverted Baytex TRSU awards equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Ranger common stock\nsubject to such Ranger TRSU award or Ranger PBRSU award (at the maximum level of performance), as\napplicable, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (x) the cash consideration divided by the volume weighted average\nprice of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to\nthe closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (y) the share consideration, rounded up to the nearest\nwhole Baytex common share. Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger TRSU awards will remain\nsubject to the same vesting schedule and Converted Baytex TRSU awards in respect of Ranger PBRSU\nawards will be converted based on the number of shares payable upon maximum performance and will remain\nsubject to the same time-vesting schedule.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, upon an involuntary termination of the holder\u2019s employment or service\nby Baytex, Ranger or any of their subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d  (as defined in the Ranger Equity Plan) or a\nresignation by the holder for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (to the extent provided and as defined in the applicable\n80 \n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naward agreement), in each case, that occurs on or within 12 months following the merger effective time, such\nawards will immediately vest in full as of such termination date.\nAny dividend equivalents that have been accrued with respect to Ranger equity awards will become\npayable ratably if and when such underlying Converted Baytex TRSU award vests.\nEach Ranger Director TRSU award will vest in full at the merger effective time and be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive, without interest, the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nRanger common stock subject to such Ranger Director TRSU award plus the amount of any dividend\nequivalents payable with respect to such Ranger Director TRSU award that remain unpaid as of the merger\neffective time. No fractional Baytex common share will be issued in respect of a Ranger Director TRSU award,\nand any such fractional Baytex common share will instead be paid in cash.\nThe table below sets forth, for each Ranger executive officer, the aggregate number of shares of Ranger\ncommon stock subject to outstanding Ranger PBRSU awards and Ranger TRSU awards held by such\nexecutive officer assuming (i) as required under SEC rules, the closing price of a share of Ranger common\nstock is $42.94 (the \u201cEstimated Closing Value\u201d), which is equal to the average closing price of a share of\nRanger common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the entry\ninto the Merger Agreement, (ii) a closing date of May 8, 2023 (which is the assumed date of closing solely for\npurpose of the disclosure in this section), and (iii) payout at maximum level of performance for each Ranger\nPBRSU award.

The Executive Severance Plan provides each executive officer with certain severance benefits upon\ncertain terminations of employment that are enhanced following a \u201cchange in control\u201d. If a \u201cchange in\ncontrol\u201d  (including the company merger) occurs and within 24 months after such \u201cchange in control\u201d event\nthe executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by Ranger without Cause (other than due to the executive\nofficer\u2019s death or disability) or the executive officer resigns with Good Reason (each as defined in the\nExecutive Severance Plan), the executive officer is eligible to receive the following payments and benefits:\na lump sum cash payment equal to 2.0 times (or 2.5 in the case of Mr. Henke) the sum of the\nexecutive\u2019s base salary and target annual bonus amount\u037e\nan additional pro-rata (based on the number of whole months worked during the year) annual bonus\nfor the year of termination (based on the actual level of performance, with any subjective or\ndiscretionary components of such annual bonus deemed achieved at the target level), payable in a\nlump sum at the same time annual bonuses are paid to other Ranger management employees\u037e\nRanger-provided outplacement services up to a maximum cost of $10,000\u037e and\nup to 18 months\u2019 employer-subsidized COBRA premiums for continued group health benefits for the\nexecutive and his or her eligible dependents.\nBenefits under the Executive Severance Plan are conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s execution of a\nrelease of claims that includes customary confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-competition and non-\nsolicitation provisions.\n\u201cCause,\u201d as defined in the Executive Severance Plan, means any one or more of the following: the\nexecutive\u2019s (i) willful and continued failure to substantially perform the executive\u2019s duties with Ranger or any\naffiliate (other than any such failure resulting from the executive\u2019s Disability, as that term is defined in the\nExecutive Severance Plan)\u037e (ii) conviction of a felony\u037e (iii) willful engagement in gross misconduct materially\nand demonstrably injurious to Ranger or any affiliate\u037e (iv) commission of one or more significant acts of\ndishonesty as regards Ranger or any affiliate\u037e or (v) willful failure to comply with any material policies or\nprocedures of Ranger as in effect from time to time.\n\u201cGood Reason,\u201d as defined in the Executive Severance Plan, means the occurrence of any of the\nfollowing events or conditions without the consent of the executive: (i) a material reduction in the\nexecutive\u2019s base salary or annual cash incentive compensation opportunity\u037e (ii) the relocation of the\nexecutive to a location more than 50 miles from Houston, Texas or the location at which the executive was\npreviously based and which increases the executive\u2019s commute by 50 miles or more\u037e or (iii) a material\ndiminution in the executive\u2019s title, authority, duties or responsibilities\u037e provided, however, that Good Reason\nshall not have occurred unless (x) such event or condition remains uncured 45 days following the executive\u2019s\ndelivery to Ranger of written notice of the specific grounds for Good Reason (the \u201cCure Period\u201d), (y) such\nwritten notice is delivered within 45 days following the initial occurrence of the event or condition giving\nrise to Good Reason, and (z) the executive terminates his or her employment with Ranger within 10 days after\nthe expiration of the Cure Period.\nThe company merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d under the Executive Severance Plan. For the\nquantification of the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be\npayable to Ranger\u2019s executive officers, see the table below under \u201c- Interests of Ranger\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u202f-\u202fQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Ranger\u2019s Named\nExecutive Officers in Connection with the Company Merger.\u201d\nThe Executive Severance Plan includes a \u201cbest net\u201d provision providing that the executive officer\u2019s\npayments and benefits will be either capped at the safe harbor amount to avoid the imposition of excise taxes\nunder Code Section 4999 or paid in full subjecting them to possible excise tax liability, whichever\n82 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprovides the better after-tax benefit to the executive.

The gross proceeds of the offering were deposited into escrow pending\nsatisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Merger Transactions.\nUpon satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, Baytex intends to use the net proceeds from the offering,\ntogether with borrowings under its credit facilities, to pay a portion of the merger consideration, to repay\nindebtedness outstanding under the Ranger credit facility, to pay any termination payments payable upon\nany early termination of Ranger\u2019s hedge agreements, to satisfy, discharge and redeem the Ranger senior\nnotes, to repay indebtedness owing to any exiting lenders under the Baytex bank facility and to pay fees and\nexpenses in connection with the foregoing.\nAt the closing of the company merger, Baytex intends to increase the revolving capacity of the Baytex\nnew bank facility from the current US$1.0 billion committed amount to US$1.1 billion, with the current\nmaturity date of April 1, 2026 remaining unchanged, and to amend the facility to provide for the Baytex term\nloan, which will mature two years from the closing date of the company merger. As a result of the completion\nof the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations (i) for U.S.\nholders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below) of Ranger Class A common stock, as of immediately\nprior to the Merger Transactions, with respect to the exchange of such Ranger Class A common stock for\ncash and Baytex common shares in the company merger and (ii) for U.S. holders of Baytex common shares\nreceived in the company merger, as of immediately following the merger effective time, with respect to the\nownership and disposition of such Baytex common shares. This discussion does not address any tax\ntreatment of any other transactions occurring in connection with the company merger, including, but not\nlimited to, the Opco Unit Exchange. The following discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S.\nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial interpretations thereof and published rulings and\nother positions of the IRS, each as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could\nsignificantly affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The U.S. federal income\ntax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. Neither Baytex nor Ranger has sought, or intends\nto seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the positions or conclusions\ndescribed in the following summary, and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary\nposition. To the extent this discussion contains statements regarding the beliefs, intentions, or expectations\nof Baytex, Ranger, or the combined company, such statements do not constitute the opinion of Vinson &\nElkins LLP or any other tax advisor.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders that hold their Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex\ncommon shares, as applicable, as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,\nproperty held for investment). This discussion is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income\ntax considerations related to the Merger Transactions or the ownership and disposition of Baytex common\nshares, nor does it describe any tax consequences of the Merger Transactions or the ownership and\ndisposition of Baytex common shares arising under any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax laws or under any\nU.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax law. Further, this discussion does not address all\naspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of its individual\ncircumstances (including the impact of the Medicare surtax on certain net investment income) or that may be\nrelevant to certain categories of holders that may be subject to special rules, such as:\nbanks, insurance companies or other financial institutions\u037e\nmutual funds, real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies\u037e\ntax-exempt or governmental organizations\u037e\n90 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code (or any entities all of the\ninterests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund)\u037e\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and corporations that\naccumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax\u037e\nentities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e\nentities or arrangements treated as S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes or holders of interests therein\u037e\ndealers in securities or foreign currencies or traders in securities that use the mark-to-market method\nof accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\npersons that hold Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as applicable, as part of a\nstraddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment or risk reduction transaction\u037e\npersons that purchased or sell their Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as\napplicable, as part of a wash sale\u037e\npersons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates or certain former citizens or\nlong-term residents of the United States\u037e\nU.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment or branch outside of the United\nStates\u037e\npersons that acquired or hold Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as applicable,\nthrough the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-\nqualified retirement plan or other tax deferred account\u037e\npersons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to\nthe shares of Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as applicable, being taken into\naccount in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d  (as defined in the Code)\u037e\npersons subject to an alternative minimum tax\u037e\nexcept as expressly discussed below, persons that actually or constructively hold (or actually or\nconstructively held at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the company merger)\nfive percent or more (by vote or value) of the Ranger common stock or Baytex common shares, as\napplicable\u037e and\nholders of Opco common units (and corresponding Ranger Class B common stock) prior to the\nMerger Transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TAX ADVICE.

If such treatment applies, a U.S. holder who receives cash and Baytex common shares in exchange\nfor shares of Ranger Class A common stock in the company merger generally will recognize capital gain or\nloss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of\nBaytex common shares received by such U.S. holder and (ii) such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the\nshares of Ranger Class A common stock exchanged therefor. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Ranger\nClass A common stock generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such Ranger Class A\ncommon stock, as adjusted for certain corporate actions. The adjusted tax basis of each Baytex common\nshare received in the company merger will initially equal the fair market value of such share at the merger\neffective time. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of Ranger Class A common stock\nexchanged by such U.S. holder if such blocks were acquired at different times or for different prices. Any\ngain or loss so recognized generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period\nin a particular block of Ranger Class A common stock is more than one year as of the merger effective time.\nLong-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. U.S. holders\nwho acquired different blocks of Ranger Class A common stock at different times or for different prices\nshould consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to\nthem.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThe exchange by a non-U.S. holder of shares of Ranger Class A common stock for cash and Baytex\ncommon shares in the company merger is expected to be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202f\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\u201d\nbelow, any gain realized by a non-U.S. holder pursuant to the company merger generally would not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such non-U.S. holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment or fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case,\nsuch gain generally would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.\npersons, and, if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch\nprofits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n92 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the company merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case,\nsuch gain would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such\nnon-U.S. holder\u037e or\nshares of Ranger Class A common stock constitute United States real property interests by reason of\nRanger\u2019s status as a United States real property holding corporation, as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) and, as a result, such gain is treated as effectively\nconnected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States.\nA non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the third bullet point above, subject to the discussion\nbelow, generally will be taxed on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to\nUnited States persons. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its United States real\nproperty interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property\ninterests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, \u201cU.S. real\nproperty interests\u201d generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Ranger believes\nthat it currently is, and expects to remain, a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,\nprovided that the Ranger Class A common stock continues to be \u201cregularly traded on an established\nsecurities market\u201d (within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations) as of the merger effective time, only\na non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively owns, or owned at any time during the shorter of the five-\nyear period ending on the date of the company merger or the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for its Ranger\nClass A common stock, more than 5% of the Ranger Class A common stock will be treated as disposing of a\nUnited States real property interest and will be taxable on gain realized on the disposition of the Ranger\nClass A common stock as a result of Ranger\u2019s status as a USRPHC. If the Ranger Class A common stock were\nnot considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market, each non-U.S. holder (regardless\nof the percentage of stock owned) would be treated as disposing of a United States real property interest\nand would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of the Ranger Class A common stock\npursuant to the company merger (in the manner described above), and a 15% withholding tax would apply to\nthe gross proceeds from such disposition. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon,\ntheir own tax advisors to determine the consequences of the company merger to them in light of their\nparticular circumstances and Ranger\u2019s status as a USRPHC.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex\nCommon Shares\nTax Residence of Baytex for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes\nA corporation is generally considered, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to be a tax resident in the\njurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Accordingly, under the generally applicable U.S. federal\nincome tax rules, Baytex, which is organized under the laws of Canada, would be treated as a non-U.S.\ncorporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the\nCode provides an exception to this general rule, under which a non-U.S. organized entity might, in certain\ncircumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These rules are complex\nand guidance regarding their application is unclear and incomplete.\nAs relevant to Baytex after the consummation of the company merger, under Section 7874 of the Code,\nan entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and organized outside the\nUnited States (i.e., a non-U.S. corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and, therefore, as an inverted corporation if the following conditions are met: (i) the\nnon-U.S. corporation, directly or indirectly, acquires substantially all of the properties held directly or\nindirectly by a U.S. corporation (including through the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of the\nU.S. corporation), and (ii) after the acquisition, the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold\nat least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation by reason of\nholding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (taking into account the receipt of the non-U.S. corporation\u2019s\nshares in exchange for the U.S. corporation\u2019s shares) as determined for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code\n(the \u201c80% Ownership Test\u201d), unless, however, (iii) the non-U.S. corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded\n93 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffiliated group\u201d has \u201csubstantial business activities\u201d in the non-U.S. corporation\u2019s country of organization\nor incorporation (and tax residence) relative to the expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities (the\n\u201cSubstantial Business Activities Exception\u201d). For purposes of computing the ownership percentage relevant\nto the 80% Ownership Test, the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code\nrequire certain adjustments to the number of shares held by former shareholders of the acquired U.S.\ncorporation and to the total number of outstanding shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation, such that\nthe ownership percentage for purposes of the 80% Ownership Test may be higher than the percentage of\noutstanding shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation actually held by former shareholders of the\nacquired U.S. corporation.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Baytex will acquire all of the outstanding Ranger Class A common\nstock. As a result, the determination of whether Baytex will be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes will depend on whether Baytex satisfies the 80% Ownership Test and, if it does, whether\nit satisfies the Substantial Business Activities Exception. If the former holders of Ranger common stock hold\nless than 80% (by both vote and value) of the Baytex common shares following the company merger (as\ndetermined by taking into account the complex adjustments to the ownership percentage required under\nSection 7874 of the Code), the 80% Ownership Test will not be satisfied, and Baytex will not be treated as\nU.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of whether the Substantial Business\nActivities Exception is satisfied. In order for Baytex to satisfy the Substantial Business Activities Exception,\nat least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), real and tangible assets, and gross income\nof Baytex\u2019s expanded affiliated group must be based, located, and derived, respectively, in the country in\nwhich Baytex is a tax resident after the consummation of the company merger (i.e., Canada).\nIf Baytex were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, this could result\nin negative tax consequences for Baytex and holders of Baytex common shares. For example, Baytex would\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on its worldwide income and, as a result, could be subject to substantial\nliabilities for additional U.S. federal income taxes and any share repurchases made by Baytex may be subject\nto the 1% non-deductible excise tax enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Moreover, the\ngross amount of any dividend payments to Baytex\u2019s non-U.S. holders could be subject to 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax (depending on the application of any income tax treaty that might apply to reduce the\nwithholding tax), and the ability of Baytex\u2019s U.S. holders to credit any Canadian taxes imposed on them may\nbe materially limited. Holders should consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the rules described above and any resultant tax consequences.\nEven if a non-U.S. acquiring corporation did not meet the 80% Ownership Test and were not an inverted\ncorporation, other adverse consequences could apply if the non-U.S. acquiring corporation were\nnonetheless a surrogate foreign corporation. A non-U.S. acquiring corporation is a surrogate foreign\ncorporation if it would meet the three requirements of Section 7874 of the Code to be treated as an inverted\ncorporation if the 80% Ownership Test threshold were reduced to 60% (the \u201c60% Ownership Test\u201d).\nIf the non-U.S. acquiring corporation were a surrogate foreign corporation, the taxable income of the\nacquired U.S. corporation (and any U.S. person considered to be related to the acquired U.S. corporation\npursuant to applicable rules) for any given year, within a period beginning on the first date the U.S.\ncorporation\u2019s properties were acquired directly or indirectly by the non-U.S. acquiring corporation and\nending 10 years after the last date the U.S. corporation\u2019s properties were acquired, will be no less than that\ncorporation\u2019s or person\u2019s \u201cinversion gain\u201d for that taxable year. A person\u2019s inversion gain includes gain from\nthe transfer of shares or any other property (other than property held for sale to customers) and income from\nthe license of any property that is either transferred or licensed as part of the acquisition or after the\nacquisition to a non-U.S. related person. In general, the effect of this provision is to deny the acquired U.S.\ncorporation and its U.S. affiliates the use of net operating losses, foreign tax credits or other tax attributes, if\nany, to offset the inversion gain. Further, more of the payments, if any, by the acquired U.S. corporation and\nits U.S. affiliates to the non-U.S. acquiring corporation and its non-U.S. affiliates may be treated as base\nerosion payments that may be subject to a minimum tax pursuant to Section 59A of the Code, and Baytex\u2019s\nU.S. subsidiaries could be subject to the stock buyback tax with respect to any share repurchases made by\nBaytex. Additionally, dividends paid by the non-U.S. acquiring corporation will not qualify for a reduced rate\nof tax as \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d as discussed below under the heading \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial\n94 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect\nto the Ownership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares\u202f-\u202fDistributions with Respect to Baytex\nCommon Shares.\u201d\nBased upon the terms of the Merger Agreement, the rules for determining share ownership under\nSection 7874 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulated promulgated thereunder, and certain factual\nassumptions, Baytex expects that, after consummation of the company merger, former holders of Ranger\ncommon stock will hold less than 60% (by both vote and value) of the Baytex common shares by reason of\nholding Ranger common stock as determined for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code, and accordingly,\nBaytex does not expect either the 80% Ownership Test or the 60% Ownership Test to be met. Accordingly,\nBaytex does not expect to be an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, and Baytex intends to take this position on its tax returns. However, Baytex has not\nsought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company\nmerger is not conditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax\nauthority or opinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax\nadvisors, the IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not an inverted corporation or a\nsurrogate foreign corporation pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. The rules for determining whether a\nnon-U.S. corporation is an inverted corporation or a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes are complex, unclear, and the subject of ongoing regulatory change. Baytex\u2019s intended position is\nnot free from doubt. Further, the application of such rules must be finally determined after completion of the\ncompany merger, by which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts, law, and other\ncircumstances.\nConsistent with Baytex\u2019s intended reporting position, the remainder of this discussion assumes that\nBaytex will not be an inverted corporation or a Surrogate Foreign Corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes under Section 7874 of the Code. However, Baytex is not representing to you that Baytex will not be\nan inverted corporation or a Surrogate Foreign Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under\nSection 7874 of the Code.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nAdverse and burdensome U.S. federal income tax rules and consequences apply to U.S. holders that\nhold shares in a non-U.S. corporation classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,\nBaytex would be treated as a PFIC with respect to a particular U.S. holder in any taxable year in which, after\napplying certain look-through rules to include its pro rata share of the gross income or assets, as applicable,\nof any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, either:\nat least 75% of its gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income, which generally\nincludes dividends, interest, rents, royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active\nconduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets\u037e or\nat least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and\naveraged quarterly over the year) produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.\nBaytex expects to take the position that it is not a PFIC for the taxable year of the company merger, but\nsuch position will not be free from doubt. The determination as to whether Baytex satisfies either or both of\nthe PFIC tests for the taxable year of the company merger will depend on, among other things, the timing of\nthe merger and the amount of Baytex\u2019s passive income and assets in the year of the company merger.\nBaytex\u2019s PFIC status for the taxable year of the company merger or any subsequent taxable year will not be\ndeterminable until after the end of each such taxable year, and Baytex cannot assure you that it will not be a\nPFIC in the taxable year of the company merger or in any future taxable year. If Baytex were later determined\nto be a PFIC, you may be unable to make certain advantageous elections with respect to your ownership of\nBaytex common shares that would mitigate the adverse consequences of Baytex\u2019s PFIC status, or making\nsuch elections retroactively could have adverse tax consequences to you. Baytex has not sought and will\nnot seek any rulings from the IRS as to such tax treatment, and the closing of the company merger is not\nconditioned upon achieving, any particular tax treatment or receiving a ruling from any tax authority or\nopinion from any tax advisor in regards thereto. Further, there can be no assurance that your tax advisors,\nthe IRS or a court will agree with the position that Baytex is not a PFIC. Thus, the intended reporting\nposition of Baytex described herein is not free from doubt.\n95 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsistent with Baytex\u2019s intended reporting position, the remainder of this discussion assumes that\nBaytex will not be treated as a PFIC in the taxable year of the company merger or any subsequent taxable\nyear. However, Baytex is not representing to you that Baytex will not be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year\nof the company merger or in any future taxable years.\nTHE PFIC RULES ARE COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT WITH, AND\nRELY SOLELY UPON, THEIR TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE APPLICATION OF THE PFIC RULES\nTO THEM AND ANY RESULTANT TAX CONSEQUENCES.\nDistributions with Respect to Baytex Common Shares\nIf Baytex pays a distribution in cash or other property to U.S. holders of Baytex common shares, such\ndistribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.\nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that\nwill be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Baytex\ncommon shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale of Baytex common shares\nand will be treated as described below under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the\nOwnership and Disposition of Baytex Common Shares\u202f-\u202fGain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Exchange\nor Disposition of Baytex Common Shares.\u201d\nDividends paid by Baytex to a corporate U.S. holder will be taxed at the regular corporate income tax rate\nand will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in\nrespect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. Dividends paid by Baytex to a non-\ncorporate U.S. holder generally will constitute \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d that will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at the tax rate accorded to long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.\nThose requirements include that (i) either Baytex is eligible for benefits under a qualifying comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the United States or Baytex common shares are readily tradable on an established\nsecurities market in the United States, (ii) certain holding period requirements are met, and (iii) Baytex is not\nclassified as a PFIC during the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or any preceding taxable year and is\nnot a surrogate foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code. If such requirements are not satisfied, a\nnon-corporate U.S. holder may be subject to tax on the dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead\nof the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income. U.S. holders should consult with, and rely\nsolely upon, their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower preferential rate for qualified dividend\nincome for any dividends paid with respect to Baytex common shares.\nDividends paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount\nbased on the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is distributed, whether or not the currency is\nconverted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. holder\u2019s tax basis in the non-U.S. currency will equal the U.S.\ndollar amount included in income. Any gain or loss realized on a subsequent conversion or other disposition\nof the non-U.S. currency for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or\nloss.\nA U.S. holder must include any amount withheld from a dividend payment on account of taxes in income\neven though the U.S. holder does not in fact receive such withheld amount. Subject to certain limitations,\nCanadian tax withheld and paid over to Canada may be creditable or deductible against the U.S. holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability. Generally, an election to deduct foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign tax\ncredits may be made, and if such election is made, it generally applies to all foreign taxes paid or accrued in\nthe taxable year. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends\nthat are subject to preferential tax rates for qualified dividend income. To the extent a refund of the tax\nwithheld is available to a U.S. holder under Canadian law or under the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty, the\namount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against such U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. holders are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.\n96 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Exchange or Disposition of Baytex Common Shares\nUpon a sale or other taxable exchange or disposition of Baytex common shares, a U.S. holder generally\nwill recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of\ncash and the fair market value of any property received in such exchange or disposition and (ii) the U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Baytex common shares so disposed of. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nits Baytex common shares generally will equal the U.S. holder\u2019s acquisition cost, less any prior distributions\npaid to such U.S. holder that were treated as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a\ndiscussion of the tax basis of Baytex common shares received pursuant to the company merger, please see\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Company Merger.\u201d Any capital gain or loss generally will be long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder held the Baytex common shares so disposed of for more than one\nyear. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced\nrates. In addition, the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with the payment of merger\nconsideration to U.S. holders and, if effected by or through a U.S. office or broker, non-U.S. holders in\nconnection with the company merger, as well as in certain circumstances, to dividends with respect to Baytex\ncommon shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of Baytex common shares. Further, such\nU.S. holders and non-U.S. holders of Ranger Class A common stock or Baytex common shares, as applicable,\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. backup withholding on the merger consideration or such dividends or other\nproceeds, as applicable, unless such U.S. holder provides the applicable withholding agent with, either (i) a\nproperly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 (or other applicable or successor form) providing such U.S.\nholder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or, (ii) a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other\napplicable or successor form) properly certifying such holder\u2019s non-U.S. status and certain other conditions\nare met, or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup\nwithholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding rules or otherwise is not an\nadditional tax and will generally be allowed as a credit against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if\nany, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required\ninformation to the IRS.\nCertain U.S. holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with\nrespect to such U.S. holder\u2019s investment in \u201cspecified foreign financial assets\u201d on IRS Form 8938 (Statement\nof Specified Foreign Financial Assets), subject to certain exceptions. An interest in Baytex constitutes a\nspecified foreign financial asset for these purposes. Persons who are required to report specified foreign\nfinancial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties and the period of limitations on\nassessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply.\nU.S. holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their tax advisors regarding the foreign financial\nasset and other reporting obligations and their application to an investment in Baytex common shares.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements Under FATCA\nSubject to the proposed U.S. Treasury regulations discussed below, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the\nCode, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose\na 30% withholding tax on payments of the merger consideration, if paid to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d or\na \u201cnon-financial foreign entity\u201d  (each as defined in the Code) (including, in some cases, when such foreign\nfinancial institution or non-financial foreign entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the case of a\nforeign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold\non certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding\nU.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution,\nas well as certain account holders that are non-U.S. entities with U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-\nfinancial foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any \u201csubstantial United States owners\u201d  (as\ndefined in the Code) or provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct\nand indirect substantial United States owners of the entity (in either case, generally on an\n97 \n",

The Ranger unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023,\nthe Ranger unaudited interim consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March\n31, 2023, and the Ranger consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and are\npresented in U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented\nin CAD and in accordance with IFRS.\nThe Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions\nOn February 27, 2023, Baytex entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d)\nwith Ranger pursuant to which Ranger and Baytex would combine through the merger of Nebula Merger Sub,\nLLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex (\u201cmerger sub\u201d) with and into Ranger (the \u201ccompany\nmerger\u201d), with Ranger continuing its existence as the surviving corporation following the company merger\n(the \u201csurviving corporation\u201d) as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex. The transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the company merger, and the payment of related fees and\nexpenses, are collectively referred to as the \u201cMerger Transactions\u201d.\nOn February 27, 2023, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (\u201cCIBC\u201d), Royal Bank of Canada (\u201cRBC\u201d)\nand The Bank of Nova Scotia (\u201cBNS\u201d) entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing for\ncertain debt financing, the proceeds of which will be used, in part, to fund a portion of the cash\nconsideration and expenses associated with the Merger Transactions. Additionally, on April 27, 2023, Baytex\nclosed a private offering of US$800 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2030 (the\n\u201cBaytex 8.500% Senior Notes\u201d) that generated net proceeds of approximately US$776.7 million. The\ntransactions contemplated by the debt commitment letter and the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes, including the\nrepayment, refinancing or redemption of existing Ranger and Baytex indebtedness, are referred to as the\n\u201cFinancing Transactions.\u201d\nAdditional information on the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions is provided in Note\n1 to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements. Capitalized terms used in the unaudited pro\nforma consolidated financial statements that are not defined above are defined in Note 1. The unaudited pro\nforma consolidated financial statements include the following adjustments for the Merger Transactions and\nthe Financing Transactions:\ntotal merger consideration of C$2.2 billion comprised of (i) the non-cash estimated share value of\nC$1.4 billion, which is based on 7.49 Baytex common shares being issued per share of Ranger Class A\ncommon stock and 41.6 million shares of Ranger common stock outstanding on May 1, 2023\n(including shares to be issued in the Opco Unit Exchange and shares to be issued in respect of\ncertain outstanding Ranger restricted stock unit awards), multiplied by a share price of C$4.65, which\nis the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX on May 8, 2023\u037e (ii) cash\nconsideration of approximately C$0.7 billion, based on payment of US$13.31 per share of Ranger Class\nA common stock outstanding at closing and 41.6 million shares of Ranger common stock outstanding\non May 1, 2023, converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35\u037e and (iii) the estimated non-cash share\naward consideration of C$33.6 million for Ranger equity awards outstanding at closing (other\n148 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthan those taken into account in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)), which will be converted to time-\nvested Baytex share awards.\nThe number of Baytex share awards to be issued to each Ranger employee holding Ranger equity\nawards as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions is equal to: (i) the number of\nsuch Ranger equity awards (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable)\u037e multiplied by\n(ii) the sum of: (a) US$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Baytex common\nshares on the NYSE for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as\nreported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (b) 7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share.\nBased on 0.9 million Ranger equity awards outstanding, assuming maximum performance multipliers\n(if applicable), at May 1, 2023, and a share price of US$3.46, which is the closing share price of the\nBaytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023, an estimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards\nwould be issued to Ranger employees. The value of this consideration is calculated as the amortized\nvalue of the Baytex share awards issued based on the elapsed service period as of March 31, 2023\nand the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards.\nthe use of proceeds of US$1.2 billion (C$1.6 billion) from the proceeds of the issuance of the Baytex\n8.500% Senior Notes and other borrowings pursuant to the Financing Transactions to fund the\nUS$0.6 billion (C$0.7 billion) cash portion of the merger consideration, to repay US$0.6 billion (C$0.9\nbillion) existing indebtedness of Ranger and to pay related fees, costs and expenses\u037e\nadjustments to convert the historical financial statements of Ranger prepared in accordance with\nGAAP to IFRS and to conform to the accounting policies used by Baytex\u037e\nadjustments to translate the Ranger unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,\n2023 from USD to CAD using the period end exchange rate of $1.35, the Ranger unaudited interim\nconsolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 from USD to\nCAD using the period average rate of $1.35, and the Ranger consolidated statement of operations for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 from USD to CAD using the 2022 average exchange rate of $1.30\u037e\nand\nadjustments to present petroleum and natural gas sales and royalty expense on a gross basis on the\nunaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income, consistent with Baytex\u2019s presentation\npractices\u037e the Ranger historical consolidated statement of operations presents revenues net of\nroyalty interests.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements contained herein do not reflect the costs of\nany integration activities or benefits that may result from the realization of future cost savings from\noperating efficiencies, or any other synergies that may result from the Merger Transactions.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions as\ndescribed in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, which\nBaytex management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are\npresented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual combined\nfinancial information would have been if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions actually\noccurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations\nor combined financial condition. If the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions are completed,\nthe actual adjustments to the consolidated financial statements of Baytex will depend on a number of factors\nand actual results may differ materially from the estimates used within the accompanying unaudited pro\nforma consolidated financial statements.\nIn accordance with IFRS, Baytex will account for the Merger Transactions using the acquisition method\nof accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the total purchase consideration paid by Baytex in\nconnection with the Merger Transactions will be allocated to Ranger\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities\nbased on their fair values as of the closing of the Merger Transactions. Any excess of the total purchase\nconsideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at\ntheir respective fair value will be recorded as goodwill. Conversely, any excess of the fair value of the\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Ranger at their respective fair values over the total\npurchase consideration would be recorded as a gain on acquisition. Ranger\u2019s operating results will be\nincluded in Baytex\u2019s consolidated results of operations only for periods subsequent to the closing of the\nMerger Transactions.\n149 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented in this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus has been derived from the unaudited historical interim financial statements of Baytex\nand Ranger as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and from the audited historical\nfinancial statements of Baytex and Ranger for the year ended December 31, 2022.

three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022\nDESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS\nOn February 27, 2023, Baytex entered into the Merger Agreement with Ranger pursuant to which Ranger\nand Baytex would combine through the merger of merger sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex,\nwith and into Ranger, with Ranger continuing its existence as the surviving corporation following the\ncompany merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Baytex. Immediately prior to the company merger,\nthe holders of shares of Ranger Class B common stock and common units in ROCC Energy Holdings, L.P. will\nexercise their right to exchange (the \u201cOpco Unit Exchange\u201d) all such shares of Ranger Class B common stock\nand Opco common units for Ranger Class A common stock. To effect the company merger, each share of\nRanger Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger effective time\n(including any shares issued pursuant to the Opco Unit Exchange other than certain excluded shares as\ndescribed in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 7.49 validly issued, fully\npaid and non-assessable Baytex common shares (the \u201cshare consideration\u201d) and (ii) US$13.31 in cash,\nwithout interest (the \u201ccash consideration\u201d and, together with the share consideration, the \u201cmerger\nconsideration\u201d).\nThe merger consideration has been estimated to be valued at approximately C$2.2 billion (US$1.6 billion)\ncomprised of (i) the non-cash estimated share consideration of C$1.4 billion, which is based on 7.49 Baytex\ncommon shares being issued per share of Ranger Class A common stock and 41.6 million shares of Ranger\ncommon stock, including shares to be issued in the Opco Unit Exchange and shares to be issued in respect\nof certain outstanding Ranger restricted stock unit awards, outstanding as of May 1, 2023, multiplied by a\nshare price of C$4.65, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX on May 8,\n2023\u037e (ii) cash consideration of approximately C$0.7 billion, based on payment of US$13.31 per share of\nRanger Class A common stock outstanding at closing and 41.6 million shares of Ranger common stock\noutstanding on May 1, 2023, converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35\u037e and (iii) estimated non-cash\nshare award consideration of C$33.6 million for Ranger equity awards outstanding at closing (other than\nthose taken into account in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)), which will be converted to time-vested Baytex\nshare awards. The number of Baytex share awards to be issued to each Ranger employee holding Ranger\nequity awards as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Transactions is equal to: (i) the number of\nsuch Ranger equity awards (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable)\u037e multiplied by (ii) the\nsum of: (a) US$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of Baytex common shares on the NYSE\nfor the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.\nand (b) 7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Based on 0.9 million Ranger equity\nawards outstanding, assuming maximum performance multipliers (if applicable), at May 1, 2023, and a share\nprice of US$3.46, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023,\nan estimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards would be issued to Ranger employees. The value of this\nconsideration is calculated as the amortized value of the Baytex share awards issued based on the elapsed\nservice period as of March 31, 2023 and the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards. The\nactual merger consideration will be calculated based on the trading price of Baytex common shares on the\nTSX and the NYSE, the USD to CAD exchange rate and the number of shares of Ranger Class A common\nstock outstanding at closing, which is expected to occur late in the second quarter of 2023 or early in the\nthird quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions described under the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the Merger\u201d.\nOn February 27, 2023, CIBC, RBC and BNS entered into a debt commitment letter with Baytex providing\nfor certain debt financing, the proceeds of which will be used, in part, to fund a portion of the cash\nconsideration and expenses of the Merger Transactions. Pursuant to the debt commitment letter, CIBC, RBC\nand BNS committed to provide a new US$1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the \u201cBaytex new bank facility\u201d)\nand up to a US$250 million term credit facility (the \u201cBaytex term loan\u201d), and CIBC and RBC committed to\nprovide a 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of US$500 million (the \u201cBaytex bridge\nloan\u201d). The Baytex term loan bears interest at SOFR plus a margin. The Baytex new bank facility bears\ninterest at SOFR plus a margin.\n154 \n2. \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditionally, on April 27, 2023, Baytex closed a private offering of US$800 million in aggregate principal\namount of senior notes due 2030 (the \u201cBaytex 8.500% Senior Notes\u201d). The Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes were\npriced at 98.709% of par, will bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and mature on April 30, 2030. As a\nresult of this offering, no borrowings are available under the Baytex bridge loan.\nFor the purposes of these unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, Baytex has assumed\nthat the proceeds from the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and Baytex term loan, along with a draw under the\nBaytex new bank facility will be used to pay the cash consideration, refinance and extinguish the existing\ndebt of Ranger and pay related fees and expenses.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThese unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements (the \u201cpro forma information\u201d) of Baytex\nhave been prepared in connection with the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions for\ninclusion in Baytex\u2019s management information circular and Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s proxy\nstatement/prospectus. The pro forma information gives pro forma effect to the Merger Transactions and the\nFinancing Transactions by applying pro forma adjustments to Baytex\u2019s and Ranger\u2019s historical consolidated\nfinancial statements in accordance with IFRS. The pro forma reporting entity includes Baytex and its\nsubsidiaries as of March 31, 2023 as well as Ranger and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2023.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 gives effect\nto the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions and assumptions described herein as if the\nMerger Transactions and Financing Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma\nconsolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 give effect to the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions and assumptions\ndescribed herein as if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions had occurred on January 1,\n2022. The accounting policies used in the preparation of the pro forma financial information are those set out\nin Baytex\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which\nwere prepared in accordance with IFRS. The pro forma information has been prepared from information\nderived from and should be read in conjunction with:\nBaytex\u2019s unaudited interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023, Baytex\u2019s\nunaudited interim consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the three month\nperiod ended March 31, 2023, and Baytex\u2019s audited consolidated statement of income and\ncomprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022, together with the accompanying notes\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cBaytex historical consolidated financial statements\u201d)\u037e and\nRanger\u2019s unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023, Ranger\u2019s unaudited\ninterim consolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023, and\nRanger\u2019s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022,\ntogether with the accompanying notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cRanger historical consolidated\nfinancial statements\u201d).\nThe Baytex historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and are\npresented in CAD. The Ranger historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with\nGAAP and are presented in USD. For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial\nstatements, adjustments have been made to the Ranger historical consolidated financial statements to\nconvert those financial statements to IFRS and present the information in CAD. In addition, adjustments\nhave been made to conform the accounting policies of Ranger to the accounting policies used by Baytex as\ndescribed in the notes to the Baytex historical consolidated financial statements.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIFRS, using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations (\u201cIFRS\n3\u201d), which will establish a new basis of accounting for all of Ranger\u2019s identifiable assets acquired and\nliabilities that will be assumed at fair value as of the closing of the Merger Transactions and are subject to\nchange. Baytex will be the acquirer for accounting purposes and Ranger will be the acquiree, based on\nfactors considered at the time of preparation. The purchase accounting is dependent upon certain valuations\nand other studies that have yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive\nmeasurement. Baytex intends to complete the valuations and other assessments upon completion of the\n155 \n3. \na. \nb. \nc. \nd. \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger Transactions and will finalize the purchase equation as soon as practicable. The various assets and\nliabilities of Ranger have been measured based on preliminary estimates.\nDifferences between these preliminary estimates and the final purchase accounting will occur, and these\ndifferences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial\nstatements and the future results of operations and financial results of Baytex. The unaudited pro forma\nconsolidated financial statements have not been adjusted to give effect to certain expected financial benefits\nof the Merger Transactions, such as tax savings, cost synergies or revenue enhancements, or the anticipated\ncosts to achieve these benefits, including the cost of integration or restructuring activities.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions as\ndescribed in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, which\nBaytex management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are\npresented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual combined\nfinancial information would have been if the Merger Transactions and the Financing Transactions actually\noccurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations\nor combined financial condition. If the proposed Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions are\ncompleted, the actual adjustments to the consolidated financial statements of Baytex will depend on a\nnumber of factors and actual results may differ materially from the estimates used within the accompanying\nunaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements.\nPRESENTATION CONFORMING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Ranger historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and\npresented in USD. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, those\nfinancial statements have been adjusted to conform to the recognition, measurement, and presentation\nrequirements of IFRS and presented in CAD, which is the presentation currency of Baytex. The adjustments\nmade to the Ranger historical consolidated financial statements are described below including certain\nadjustments to conform with IFRS (\u201cGAAP adjustments\u201d) and adjustments to align with Baytex\u2019s\npresentation and accounting policies.\nThe Ranger interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 was translated from USD to\nCAD using the period end exchange rate of $1.35. The Ranger interim consolidated statement of\noperations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 was translated from USD to CAD\nusing the period average exchange rate of $1.35. The Ranger consolidated statement of operations\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 was translated from USD to CAD using the 2022 average\nexchange rate of $1.30.\nReflects presentation conforming adjustments to reclassify and/or combine certain asset and\nliability balances presented separately, or under different headings, on the face of the Ranger\nconsolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023.\nReflects presentation conforming adjustments to reclassify and combine certain income and\nexpense amounts presented separately, or under different headings, on the face of the Ranger\nconsolidated statement of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements include GAAP adjustments, net of\nestimated depletion on those adjustments, including:\nUnder IFRS, each cash generating unit comprising oil and gas properties is tested for impairment\nwhen indicators are identified. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the\nasset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and\nits value in use. Subsequent reversals of impairment losses are allowed, but limited to cumulative\nhistorical impairment losses, net of subsequent depletion. Conversely, under GAAP, impairment\ntesting is performed at the asset group level, which may consist of multiple assets with similar\ncharacteristics. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of the asset group\nexceeds proved reserves discounted at 10%, and subsequent reversals of impairment losses are\n156 \n\u2022 \ne. \nf. \ng. \nh. \n4. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprohibited. Using preliminary estimates, the fair value of the oil and gas properties of Ranger\nexceeds its carrying value as of January 1, 2022 resulting in a $264.5 million impairment reversal\nunder IFRS which represents all historical accumulated impairments net of depletion. No such\nreversal would be recognized under GAAP.\nUnder GAAP, depletion is calculated using proved reserves and associated finding and\ndevelopment costs, while under IFRS the Company\u2019s accounting policy is to use proved and\nprobable reserves and associated finding and development costs. The impact of these GAAP\ndifferences, being the reversal of impairment and the change in reserves and associated finding\nand development costs, resulted in $27.8 million of additional depletion of oil and gas properties\nfor the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and $119.7 million of additional depletion of oil\nand gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nReflects the adjustment to present petroleum and natural gas sales and royalty expense on a gross\nbasis on the pro forma consolidated statement of income, consistent with Baytex\u2019s presentation\npractices.

The sources and uses of financing are set forth in the following table and are\nconverted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35 to reflect the Merger Transactions and Financing Transactions\nin the presentation currency of Baytex.\nSources (in thousands of Canadian dollars)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$\n104,838\nBaytex new bank facility (principal excluding deferred issue costs)\n309,275\nBaytex term loan\n270,550\nBaytex 8.500% Senior Notes\n1,068,229\nBaytex common shares\n1,447,826\nBaytex share awards\n33,593\nTotal sources\n$3,234,311\nUses (in thousands of Canadian dollars)\nPurchase price\n$ 2,229,894\nRanger credit facilities (principal)\n324,661\nRanger senior notes (principal including change in control premium)\n546,511\nTransaction and financing costs\n133,245\nTotal uses\n$3,234,311\nThe estimated share consideration of C$1.4 billion was determined based on 7.49 Baytex common shares\nbeing issued per share of Ranger Class A common stock outstanding and 41,570,152 shares of Ranger\ncommon stock issued and outstanding on May 1, 2023, including (i) 19,008,710 shares of Ranger Class A\ncommon stock and (ii) 22,548,998 shares of Ranger Class B common stock and 12,444 DSUs that will be\nconverted into shares of Ranger Class A common stock at closing, for an estimated aggregate total of\n311,360,438 Baytex common shares to be issued. The estimated 311.4 million Baytex common shares issued is\nmultiplied by the share price of C$4.65, which is the closing price of the Baytex common shares on the TSX\non May 8, 2023 (the most recent practicable date for the preparation of these unaudited pro forma\nconsolidated financial statements) to calculate total share consideration. The estimated cash consideration is\nbased on payment equal to US$13.31 per share of Ranger common stock outstanding and 41.6 million shares\nof Ranger common stock outstanding on May 1, 2023, converted from USD to CAD at a rate of $1.35. The\nestimated non-cash share award consideration of C$33.6 million relates to the amortized value of Ranger\nequity awards outstanding at closing (other than DSUs that will be converted into shares of Ranger Class A\ncommon stock at closing), which will be converted into time-vested Baytex share awards. The number of\nBaytex share awards to be issued to each Ranger employee holding Ranger equity awards as of immediately\nprior to the closing of the Merger Transactions is equal to: (i) the number of such Ranger equity awards\noutstanding (assuming maximum performance multipliers, if applicable)\u037e multiplied by (ii) the sum of: (a)\nUS$13.31 divided by the volume weighted average price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE for the\nfive consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. and (b)\n7.49, rounded up to the nearest whole Baytex common share. Based on 0.9 million Ranger equity awards\noutstanding at May 1, 2023, assuming maximum performance multipliers (if applicable), and a share price of\nUS$3.46, which is the closing share price of the Baytex common shares on the NYSE on May 8, 2023, an\nestimated 10.7 million Baytex share awards would be issued to Ranger employees. The value of the share\n158 \nb. \nc. \nd. \ne. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naward consideration is calculated as the amortized value of the Baytex share awards issued based on the\nelapsed service period as of March 31, 2023 and the retained historical vesting dates of the Ranger awards.\nThe total merger consideration will change based on fluctuations in the price of the Baytex common\nshares on the TSX and the NYSE, the CAD:USD exchange rate and the number of shares of Ranger common\nstock and Ranger equity awards outstanding at the completion of the Merger Transactions. Determinations\nof fair value often require management to make assumptions and estimates about future events. The\npurchase equation is preliminary as the Merger Transactions have not closed as of the date of the pro forma\ninformation. As described in Note 2, the final purchase equation will be based on the fair value of the net\nassets purchased at the closing date of the proposed company merger and other information available at that\ntime. There may be material differences from this pro forma purchase price equation as a result of finalizing\nthe valuation.\nA $1 change in Baytex\u2019s share price upon closing would have a $311.4 million impact on total merger\nconsideration. A $0.10 change in the CAD:USD exchange rate upon closing would have a $164.8 million\nimpact on total merger consideration.\nOil and gas properties\nThe fair value of oil and gas properties acquired was estimated based on their fair value calculated as\nthe present value of the estimated future cash flows after-tax associated with proved plus probable oil and\ngas reserves discounted at 12.7%. Baytex\u2019s independent reserve evaluators have provided a preliminary\nassessment of Ranger\u2019s proved plus probable reserves as of December 31, 2022, which was adjusted for\nforecasted commodity prices as of May 4, 2023.\nA 1% change in the discount rate would have a $110.0 million impact on the fair value of oil and gas\nproperties.\nOther plant and equipment, working capital, financial derivatives, lease assets, lease obligations, credit\nfacilities and senior notes\nBaytex has assumed that the carrying value is equal to fair value for other plant and equipment, working\ncapital (including cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other payables), financial\nderivatives, lease assets and lease obligations. Additionally, the fair value of each of the Ranger credit\nfacilities and the Ranger senior notes is assumed to be equal to the principal balance outstanding at March\n31, 2023, plus the change in control offer premium Baytex is obligated to make pursuant to the terms of the\nRanger senior notes. Trade and other payables also includes $51.4 million for transaction costs directly\nattributable to the Merger Transactions expected to be incurred by Ranger prior to closing.\nAsset retirement obligations\nThe fair value of asset retirement obligations was determined based on preliminary estimates of\nexpected expenditures as of March 31, 2023 and discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 7.0%.\nDeferred income tax asset\nThe deferred income tax asset was determined by applying statutory tax rates to the temporary\ndifferences between the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related tax pools.\nRanger previously calculated the deferred tax liability based on the public share of these temporary\ndifferences, which was approximately 46% at March 31, 2023. Following the Merger Transactions the\nnoncontrolling interest reported in Ranger\u2019s historical consolidated financial statements will be converted to\ncommon interest. The value of the deferred tax asset includes the increase in temporary differences\npreviously attributed to the noncontrolling interest, the increase in tax pools inherited following the close of\nthe Merger Transactions, as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets which were previously\nunrecognized. The federal deferred tax assets which were previously unrecognized are now fully offset by\nfederal deferred tax liabilities, which enable them to be recognized in full.\nThe deferred tax asset does not adjust for potential synergies that could result from restructuring or\nother discretionary actions, as there are currently not enough supportable facts to reliably estimate these\nvalues. Only amounts that are directly attributable to the Merger Transactions and factually supportable\nhave been adjusted for.\n159 \n5. \na. \nb. \nc. \nd. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe deferred tax assets acquired of $58.7 million is primarily related to U.S. federal income taxes. At\nMarch 31, 2023, the Baytex historical deferred tax liability associated with U.S. federal income taxes exceeds\nthe deferred tax asset acquired and can therefore be used to reduce Baytex\u2019s deferred tax liability as at March\n31, 2023. As such, the deferred tax asset acquired has been presented as a reduction to the deferred tax\nliability in the unaudited pro forma statement of financial position.\nPRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2023 gives effect\nto the following assumptions and adjustments which are considered directly attributable to the Merger\nTransactions and the Financing Transactions and factually supportable.\nCash\nFinancing Transactions\nReflects a net increase in cash of $748.5 million associated with Financing Transactions described in\nNote 1 including an increase of $567.7 million related to a draw on the Baytex credit facilities and an increase\nof $1.1 billion related to the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes, partially offset by a $324.7 million\ndecrease related to the repayment of the Ranger credit facilities and a $546.5 million decrease related to the\nextinguishment of the Ranger senior notes, inclusive of change in control premium. The Baytex 8.500%\nSenior Notes are net of $16.2 million financing costs which are capitalized against the notes and are\nrecognized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the note. These notes are assumed to be received\nand repaid in cash.\nMerger Transactions\nConcurrent with the receipt of cash from the Financing Transactions described above, the net proceeds\nof $748.5 million will be used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price consideration.\nOil and gas properties\nReflects a $468.3 million increase to the carrying value of Ranger\u2019s oil and gas properties to adjust to\ntheir estimated fair value based on preliminary estimates, as described in the purchase equation in Note 4, as\nwell as a $60.4 million increase related to the subsequent remeasurement of asset retirement obligations\ndescribed further in Note 5f. Balances historically presented as prepaid and other assets and assets held for\nsale have been valued in conjunction with oil and gas properties and reclassified within the unaudited pro\nforma consolidated statement of financial position.\nTrade and other Payables\nReflects estimated transaction costs, which are directly attributable to the Merger Transactions,\nincurred by both Ranger and Baytex prior to close. The Ranger transaction costs of $51.4 million attributable\nto the Merger Transactions are included in trade and other payables in the purchase equation under Note 4.\nBaytex transaction costs incurred as a result of Merger Transactions of $53.4 million have been included in\ntrade and other payables.\nBaytex credit facilities\nFinancing Transactions\nThe net increase in credit facilities of $243.0 million is the result of a $243.0 million draw on the Baytex\nnew bank facility which is used, together with the cash generated in Financing Transactions as described in\nNote 5e of $505.5 million, to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration of $748.5 million. The net\nincrease in credit facilities also includes the repayment of the Ranger credit facility of $324.7 million as\nshown in the purchase price equation (Note 4) and the financing costs associated with the Baytex new bank\nfacility of $12.2 million, funded by a draw on the Baytex new bank facility of $312.5 million.\n160 \ne. \nf. \ng. \nh. \ni. \ni. \nii. \niii. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger Transactions\nReflects a $9.4 million increase in credit facilities due to the elimination of Ranger historical debt issue\ncosts as a result of the fair value adjustment in the purchase price equation (Note 4).\nLong-term notes\nFinancing Transactions\nReflects a net increase in long-term notes of $505.5 million associated with Financing Transactions\ndescribed in Note 1 including an increase of $1.1 billion related to the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior\nNotes, partially offset by a $541.1 million decrease related to the extinguishment of the Ranger senior notes.\nThe Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes are net of financing costs which are capitalized against the Baytex 8.500%\nSenior Notes and are recognized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the note. The issuance of the\nBaytex 8.500% Senior notes are assumed to be received in cash and the repayment of the Ranger senior\nnotes are assumed to be paid in cash.\nMerger Transactions\nReflects a $14.2 million increase in long-term notes due to the elimination of Ranger historical debt issue\ncosts as a result of the fair value adjustment in the purchase price equation (Note 4).\nAsset retirement obligations\nReflects an increase in asset retirement obligations to adjust to its estimated fair value based on\npreliminary estimates discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, as described in Note 4. Additionally,\nsubsequent to the initial fair value measurement, the obligations acquired were remeasured using a risk-free\nrate of 3.0%, resulting in a $60.4 million increase in asset retirement obligations and oil and gas properties.\nDeferred income tax liability\nThe decrease in deferred tax liability is mostly related to fair value assigned in the purchase price\nequation as described in Note 4, as well as the deferred tax consequences of transaction costs incurred by\nBaytex prior to close. As a result of the Merger Transactions, a deferred tax asset of $58.7 million has been\ngenerated related to U.S. federal income taxes. After closing, the deferred tax asset acquired can be used to\nreduce Baytex\u2019s historical deferred tax liability related to U.S. federal income taxes. Similarly, the deferred tax\nasset generated in Canada as a result of Baytex transaction costs incurred as part of the Merger\nTransactions of $19.8 million can be used to reduce Baytex\u2019s historical deferred tax liability in Canada. As a\nresult, no incremental deferred tax assets are included in the pro forma consolidated statement of financial\nposition. Since the deferred tax assets are fully offset by deferred tax liabilities in the same jurisdictions, the\nMerger Transactions have instead been classified as a reduction to deferred tax liabilities.\nShareholders\u2019 capital\nReflects an increase due to the issuance of Baytex common shares to Ranger shareholders as outlined in\nthe calculation of merger consideration per Note 1, partially offset by the elimination of historical Ranger\ncommon stock.\nOther equity\nThe decrease in other equity, including contributed surplus, accumulated other comprehensive income\nand noncontrolling interest, reflects adjustments for the following:\nshare award consideration related to the fair value of Baytex share awards to be granted to holders\nof Ranger equity awards\u037e\nthe elimination of Ranger additional paid-in capital and accumulated other comprehensive income\u037e\nand\nthe elimination of the noncontrolling interest, which will cease to exist upon the conversion of\n161 \nj. \ni. \nii. \n6. \na. \nb. \nc. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRanger Class B common stock to Ranger Class A common stock immediately prior to the closing of\nthe company merger.\nRetained earnings\nThe decrease in retained earnings reflects adjustments for the following:\na decrease to reflect the elimination of Ranger historical retained earnings\u037e and\na decrease to reflect $53.4 million transaction costs incurred by Baytex prior to close net of tax of\n$19.8 million.\nPRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF\nINCOME\nThe unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31,\n2023 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022\ngives effect to the following assumptions and adjustments, which are considered directly attributable to the\nMerger Transactions and the Financing Transactions. In addition, the Ranger historical consolidated\nfinancial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma\nconsolidated financial statements, those financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the\nrecognition, measurement, and presentation requirements of IFRS.\nTransaction costs\nThe increase in transaction costs relates to estimated fees and expenses expected to be incurred by\nboth Baytex and Ranger which are considered directly attributable to the Merger Transactions and are not\nexpected to recur beyond 12 months after closing. Transaction costs include advisory fees, legal fees, tax\nfees and other professional fees, as well as post-combination severance costs for certain executives which\nthe Company has decided to terminate upon closing. Transaction costs incurred by Baytex and Ranger\nduring the three month period ended March 31, 2023 have been adjusted from the unaudited pro forma\nconsolidated statement of income for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 as they have been\nincluded in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDepletion and depreciation\nDepletion and depreciation expense for Ranger has increased assuming that the fair value of oil and gas\nproperties reflected in the purchase equation were acquired on January 1, 2022. The depletion rate has been\ncalculated using opening proved plus probable reserves acquired in conjunction with the preliminary\nestimate of reserves acquired which resulted in $14.0 million of additional depletion of oil and gas properties\nfor the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and $75.7 million of additional depletion of oil and gas\nproperties for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancing and interest\nReflects an increase in financing and interest expense of $17.8 million for the three month period ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and an increase of $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of an\nincrease in outstanding debt following the issuance of the Baytex 8.500% Senior Notes and the increase in\ndebt following payment of purchase price consideration, partially offset by the repayment of the Ranger\nsenior notes. An average SOFR rate of 4.5%, plus applicable margins has been used to calculate interest on\nthe estimated average balance outstanding on the Baytex term loan and the Baytex new bank facility for the\nthree month period ended March 31, 2023. An average SOFR rate of 1.8%, plus applicable margins, has been\nused to calculate interest on the estimated average balance outstanding on the Baytex term loan and Baytex\nnew bank facility for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA change in the interest rate of 1/8 percent results in a change in financing and interest expense of $0.8\nmillion for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 and a change in financing and interest expense of\n$3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n162 \nd. \ne. \n7. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDeferred income tax expense\nThe increase in deferred tax expense reflects changes to the fair value of temporary differences, as\ndescribed in Note 5g, assuming the Merger Transactions closed at the beginning of each period presented.\nFollowing the close of the Merger Transactions, Ranger would no longer have any accumulated\nunrecognized deferred tax assets, and therefore the expense reflects Ranger net income for the three month\nperiod ended March 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022 multiplied by the relevant statutory tax\nrate.\nWeighted average common shares\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2023, pro forma basic weighted average shares outstanding\nincludes 545.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical\nconsolidated financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2023 plus 311.4 million\ncommon shares issued in conjunction with the merger consideration. Pro forma diluted weighted average\nshares outstanding includes 548.1 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the\nBaytex historical consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2023 plus 311.4 million\ncommon shares issued and the conversion of Ranger equity awards into 10.7 million share awards of Baytex.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, pro forma basic weighted average shares outstanding includes\n558.0 million basic weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2022 plus 311.4 million common shares issued in\nconjunction with the merger consideration. Pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes\n563.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as disclosed in the Baytex historical consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2022 plus 311.4 million common shares issued and the\nconversion of Ranger equity awards into 10.7 million share awards of Baytex.\nSUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA OIL, NGL AND GAS RESERVES INFORMATION\nThe following tables present the estimated pro forma combined net proved developed and undeveloped\noil, natural gas liquids (\u201cNGL\u201d), bitumen and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, along with a summary of\nchanges in quantities of proved reserves during the year ended December 31, 2022. The pro forma combined\nstandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves as of December 31,\n2022, as well as changes to the standardized measure for the year ended December 31, 2022, are also\npresented.\nThis pro forma combined reserves, production and standardized measure information gives effect to the\nMerger Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022\u037e however, the proved reserves and\nstandardized measures presented below represent the respective estimates made as of December 31, 2022, by\nBaytex and Ranger while they were separate companies. These estimates have not been updated for changes\nin development plans or other factors, which have occurred or may occur subsequent to December 31, 2022,\nor subsequent to the completion of the Merger Transactions.

a\nsufficient number of any securities of the\nissuer to materially affect control of the\nissuer. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d means,\ngenerally, any amalgamation,\narrangement, consolidation, amendment\nto share terms or other transaction, as a\nControl Share Acquisitions Statute.\nUnder the Virginia control share\nacquisitions statute (Article 14.1 of the\nVSCA), shares acquired in an acquisition\nthat would cause an acquiror\u2019s voting\nstrength to meet or exceed any of three\nthresholds (20%, 33 \u22153% or 50%) have no\nvoting rights unless (1) those rights are\ngranted by a majority vote of all\noutstanding shares other than those held\nby the acquiror or any officer or employee\ndirector of the corporation or (2) the\narticles of incorporation or bylaws of the\ncorporation provide that the provisions of\nthe control share acquisitions statute do\nnot apply to acquisitions of its shares. An\nacquiring person that owns five percent\nor more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock\nmay require that a special meeting of the\nshareholders be held to consider the\ngrant of voting rights to the shares\nacquired in the control share acquisition.\nThis regulation was designed to deter\ncertain takeovers of Virginia public\ncorporations. Virginia law permits\ncorporations to opt out of the control\nshare acquisition statute. Ranger has not\nopted out.\nAffiliated Transactions. Under the\nVirginia anti-takeover law regulating\naffiliated transactions (Article 14 of the\nVSCA), material acquisition transactions\nbetween a Virginia corporation and any\nholder of more than 10% of any class of\nits outstanding voting shares are required\nto be approved by the holders of at least\ntwo-thirds of the remaining voting shares.\nAffiliated transactions subject to this\napproval requirement include mergers,\nshare exchanges, material dispositions of\ncorporate assets not in the ordinary\ncourse of business, any dissolution of the\ncorporation proposed by or on behalf of a\n10% holder or any reclassification,\nincluding reverse stock splits,\nrecapitalization or merger of the\ncorporation with its subsidiaries, that\n188 \n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProvision\nBaytex\nRanger\nconsequence of which the interest of a\nholder of an equity security may be\nterminated without the holder\u2019s consent.\nincreases the percentage of voting shares\nowned beneficially by a 10% holder by\nmore than five percent. For three years\nfollowing the time that a shareholder\nbecomes an interested shareholder, a\nVirginia corporation cannot engage in an\naffiliated transaction with the interested\nshareholder without approval of two-\nthirds of the disinterested voting shares\nand a majority of the disinterested\ndirectors. A disinterested director is a\ndirector who was a director on the date on\nwhich an interested shareholder became\nan interested shareholder or was\nrecommended for election or elected by a\nmajority of the disinterested directors\nthen on the board. After three years, the\napproval of the disinterested directors is\nno longer required. The provisions of this\nstatute do not apply if a majority of\ndisinterested directors approve the\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nacquisition of shares making a person an\ninterested shareholder.

To the extent that amounts are properly deducted or withheld and paid over\nto the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of\nthis Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such amounts would have been\npaid absent such deduction or withholding, and if withholding is taken in Parent Common Shares, the\nrelevant withholding agent shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Shares on behalf of\nsuch Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such withholding\nand paid such cash proceeds to the relevant Taxing Authority.\n6.
