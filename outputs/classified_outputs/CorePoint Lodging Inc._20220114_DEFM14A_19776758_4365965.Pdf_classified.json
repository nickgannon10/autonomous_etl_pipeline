You will not be\nable to attend the meeting in person.\nPurpose of the Special Meeting (see page 28)\nAt the special meeting, CorePoint stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n \n \n\u2022\n to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the \u201cmerger proposal\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid by CorePoint to its named executive\nofficers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the \u201cnamed executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\u201d)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting\nadditional votes for the approval of the merger proposal if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger proposal at the time of the\nspecial meeting or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to CorePoint\nstockholders (the \u201cadjournment proposal\u201d).\nThe Board unanimously has determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the\nbest interest of CorePoint and its stockholders, approved and adopted the merger agreement, and declared advisable, approved and authorized the\nentry into the merger agreement, the merger and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board\nunanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal. \nCorePoint stockholders must vote to approve the merger proposal as a condition for the merger to occur. If CorePoint stockholders fail to approve\nthe merger proposal by the requisite vote, the merger will not occur.\nRecord Date\u037e Stockholders Entitled to Vote (see page 29)\nOnly holders of CorePoint common stock at the close of business on January 14, 2022, the record date for the special meeting (the \u201crecord date\u201d),\nwill be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any\n \n2\nTable of Contents\nadjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 59,136,507 shares of CorePoint common stock\nwere issued and outstanding.\nHolders of CorePoint common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of CorePoint common stock they own at the close of business on the\nrecord date. The vote of the holders of CorePoint\u2019s Cumulative Redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, which we refer to as\nthe \u201cCorePoint preferred stock,\u201d is not required to approve any of the proposals at the special meeting.\nQuorum (see page 29)\nThe presence at the virtual meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast as of the\nclose of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Actual attendance at the virtual meeting is not required in order to be counted for\npurposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be\nrepresented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement of the special meeting and may subject CorePoint to additional\nexpense. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting.\nRequired Vote (see page 29)\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of CorePoint common\nstock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nproposal.\nApproval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote\nof a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on the proposal.\nAs of January 14, 2022, the directors and executive officers of CorePoint either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned and\nwere entitled to vote 2,490,944 shares of CorePoint common stock, representing approximately 4.2% of the shares of CorePoint common stock\noutstanding on that date. CorePoint currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of CorePoint common stock in\nfavor of the foregoing proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so. In addition, concurrently with the\nexecution of the merger agreement, certain of our stockholders (the \u201cBlackstone parties\u201d) who collectively own 17,586,538 shares of CorePoint\ncommon stock, or approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock, entered into a support agreement with Cavalier\npursuant to which they agreed, among other things, to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposal. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Support Agreement\u201d beginning on page 101 for more information on the support agreement.\nAttendance and Voting at the Special Meeting (see page 30)\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a \u201cstockholder of record\u201d and you may vote your\nshares virtually at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy by mail, over the internet or by telephone. If you plan to attend the virtual special\nmeeting, you will be able to vote your shares electronically. Although CorePoint offers four different methods for shares to be voted at the special\nmeeting, CorePoint encourages you to submit a proxy over the internet or by telephone, as CorePoint believes they are the most convenient, cost-\neffective and reliable methods of causing your shares to be voted. If you choose to submit a proxy over the internet or by telephone, there is no\nneed for you to mail back your proxy card.\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you will\nreceive a vote instruction form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted.\n \n3\nTable of Contents\nCorePoint recommends that you submit a proxy or submit your voting instructions as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the\nspecial meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special meeting. If you return an executed proxy and do not indicate\nhow you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of CorePoint common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal.\nSolicitation of Proxies (see page 32)\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and CorePoint will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (\u201cInnisfree\u201d) has been retained\nto assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $40,000, plus a contingent success fee of $20,000, subject to potential\nincrease in certain circumstances, and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with\nthe special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks,\nand other nominees to the beneficial owners of shares of CorePoint common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their\nreasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by\nInnisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of CorePoint\u2019s directors, officers and employees.\nAdjournments and Postponements (see page 32)\nIn addition to the merger proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, CorePoint stockholders are also being\nasked to approve the adjournment proposal, which will enable the adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes\nin favor of the merger proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal or to ensure that\nany supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement is timely provided to CorePoint stockholders. Whether or not a quorum is\npresent, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another place, date or time. In addition, if a quorum is present, then the\nholders of a majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal may approve the adjournment proposal and adjourn the meeting. If the special\nmeeting is adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional votes on the merger proposal, stockholders who have already submitted\ntheir proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals. If you submit a proxy and do not indicate how you wish\nto vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.\nCorePoint may postpone, recess or adjourn the special meeting (and shall postpone, recess or adjourn if requested by Cavalier, (but in such case\nCorePoint shall not be required to postpone or adjourn the special meeting to a date that is later than April 28, 2022)) (i) to the extent required by law\nor duty, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent CorePoint reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain\nthe necessary vote to approve the merger proposal, (iii) if as of the time for which the special meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient\nshares of CorePoint common stock represented (either in person at the virtual special meeting or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum\nnecessary to conduct the business of the special meeting or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination of any\nsupplemental or amended disclosure which the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under\napplicable law or duty and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by CorePoint stockholders prior to the\nspecial meeting.\nThe Merger\nStructure of the Merger (see page 34)\nUpon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with the Maryland\nGeneral Corporation Law, which we refer to as the \u201cMGCL\u201d, and the\n \n4\nTable of Contents\nDelaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which we refer to as \u201cDRULPA\u201d, at the effective time of the merger (the \u201ceffective time\u201d),\nCorePoint will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Cavalier. At the effective time, each share of CorePoint common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than\nshares of common stock owned by CorePoint, Cavalier or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time and not held on behalf of third parties\n(\u201ccancelled shares\u201d) and shares of common stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CorePoint or Cavalier (other than\nMerger Sub) (\u201cconverted shares\u201d) and Restricted Stock (as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger\nconsideration. At the effective time, each share of CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be converted into a unit of a newly created series of\npreferred limited partnership interests of Merger Sub with substantially identical powers, preferences, privileges, and rights as the CorePoint\npreferred stock and, upon such conversion, the CorePoint preferred stock will automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist.\nMerger Consideration \u2014 What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 34)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, CorePoint common stockholders will have the right to\nreceive, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii), if applicable, incremental cash consideration per\nshare in certain circumstances if CorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings, which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\nMatter,\u201d with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) related to an ongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to CorePoint\u2019s 2018 spin-off\nfrom La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of the merger\nagreement (November 6, 2021) and the effective time of the merger determined by CorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint\u2019s qualification for\ntaxation as a REIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to be paid (collectively, the \u201cper share merger consideration\u201d), for each\nshare of CorePoint common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any cancelled shares or converted\nshares or Restricted Stock). The amount of such potential additional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock will\nbe determined based on the amount, if any, by which the settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued\ninterest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million. CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on\nNovember 5, 2021, and has entered into a definitive agreement with the IRS on the basis of such offer on November 29, 2021, which remains subject\nto the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, as described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Merger Consideration\u2014What\nStockholders Will Receive in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 34. There can be no assurances that any additional consideration will be received by\nthe holders of CorePoint common stock.\nEffects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed (see page 35)\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of CorePoint common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain a public\ncompany, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, CorePoint may be required to pay Cavalier\na termination fee of $29 million, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 99. Under specified\ncircumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Cavalier may be required to pay CorePoint a termination fee of $58 million, as described\nunder \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be consummated, it\nis likely that the price of our common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock\nwould return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\n \n5\nTable of Contents\nTreatment of CorePoint Equity Awards (see page 35)\nThe merger agreement provides that outstanding equity-based awards issued under CorePoint\u2019s equity incentive plans will be treated as set forth\nbelow:\nStock Units. Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding share of CorePoint common stock subject to vesting restrictions (\u201cRestricted\nStock\u201d), restricted stock unit (other than a performance-based restricted stock unit (\u201cPSU\u201d)) (\u201cRSU\u201d) or deferred stock unit granted under the\nCorePoint 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (each, a \u201cStock Unit\u201d) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof,\nbecome immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Unit will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the\neffective time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such Stock Unit immediately prior to\nthe effective time multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the\nterms of any applicable Stock Unit award agreement (\u201cdividend equivalent rights\u201d), less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such\npayment.\nPSUs. Immediately prior to the effective time, each PSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become\nimmediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of each such PSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the effective\ntime, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time,\ncalculated based on the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B)\ntarget level performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalent rights\nprovided under the terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (see page 47)\nAfter consideration of various factors, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement were advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement, (iii)\ndeclared advisable, approved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement be submitted for consideration by CorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and (v) resolved to\nrecommend that CorePoint stockholders approve the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. A description of factors\nconsidered by the Board in reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement can be found in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nRecommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 47.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote:\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nOpinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (see page 53)\nIn connection with the merger, on November 6, 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d), CorePoint\u2019s financial advisor, delivered to the\nBoard an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of November 7, 2021 and\nbased upon and subject\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nto the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion,\nthe per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated November 7, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with such opinion, is attached as Annex B. The summary of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion. The holders of CorePoint\ncommon stock are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and\nassistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. J.P. Morgan did not express any opinion as to the fairness of any\nconsideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nCorePoint, or as to the underlying decision by CorePoint to engage in the merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a\nfairness committee of J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of CorePoint common stock should vote\nwith respect to the approval of the merger or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the Board received from J.P. Morgan, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\u201d beginning on page 53.\nInterests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 61)\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, you should be aware that CorePoint\u2019s executive\nofficers and directors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or partner, have interests in the merger that may\nbe different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint\u2019s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them,\namong other matters, in approving the merger and deciding to recommend that CorePoint stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal. These\ninterests are described below. For purposes of the discussion below, CorePoint\u2019s executive officers are President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith\nA. Cline\u037e Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Daniel E. Swanstrom II\u037e and Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel,\nMark M. Chloupek (together with Messrs. Cline and Swanstrom, the \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d or \u201cNEOs\u201d). CorePoint does not currently have any\nother executive officers other than the NEOs. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 61.\nThese material interests are summarized below:\n \n \n\u2022\n CorePoint\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification\nagreements, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies and the merger agreement.\n \n \n\u2022\n Certain of CorePoint\u2019s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation and benefits under CorePoint\u2019s\nExecutive Severance Plan (as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014 Interests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nin the Merger\u201d beginning on page 61).\n \n \n\u2022\n The merger agreement provides for the payment of a pro-rated portion of annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 (with performance deemed\nachieved at target) for all employees eligible for an annual bonus (including the named executive officers) if closing does not occur by\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n \n \n\u2022\n The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all CorePoint equity-based awards including Restricted\nStock, RSUs, PSUs, deferred stock units, and dividend equivalent rights associated with such awards for all employees holding such\nawards (including the named executive officers).\n \n7\nTable of Contents\nFinancing of the Merger (see page 66)\nWe anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consolidation, repay\nor redeem any indebtedness to be repaid or redeemed by CorePoint and its subsidiaries pursuant to the merger agreement and pay all fees, costs and\nexpenses required to be paid by Cavalier or Merger Sub at or prior to the closing of the merger in connection with the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement), which would be approximately $1.7 billion, will be funded through a combination of the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n equity commitments by Cerberus Credit (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d) and the\nHighgate Sponsors (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d) in an aggregate amount up to\n$658,138,203, subject to increase and reduction in certain circumstances, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in\nthe respective equity commitment letters, as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u2014\nEquity Financing\u201d beginning on page 67\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n debt financing commitments from the debt commitment parties (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the\nMerger\u201d) consisting of a mortgage and/or mezzanine loan facility in an amount up to, subject to certain limitations, $1,030,000,000,\nas further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger \u2014Debt Financing\u201d beginning on page 69.\nEach of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors are providing limited guaranties, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nrespective limited guaranties, guaranteeing the payment and performance of Cavalier of its parent termination fee obligations and certain other\npayment obligations, as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger \u2014Limited Guaranties\u201d beginning on page\n68.\nThe consummation of the merger is not conditioned upon Cavalier obtaining the proceeds of any financing.\nRegulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 70)\nCorePoint and Cavalier have determined that the filing of notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) (or other\nantitrust laws) will not be necessary to complete the merger. However, at any time before or after the merger, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, a state attorney general or a foreign competition authority could take action under the\nantitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking divestiture of assets of\nCorePoint, Cavalier or their respective affiliates. Private parties may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (see page 71)\nAs of the date of this definitive proxy statement, three lawsuits challenging the merger have been filed against CorePoint and the Board. The first\nlawsuit, captioned Wang v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00026, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on\nJanuary 3, 2022. The second lawsuit, captioned Whitfield v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00147, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York on January 6, 2022. The third lawsuit, captioned Gorrell v. CorePoint Lodging Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-00146, was filed in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on January 10, 2022. The complaints filed in these lawsuits allege, among other things,\nthat the defendants caused a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in violation of Sections 14(a)\nand 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). CorePoint and the Board believe these lawsuits are without\nmerit and intend to defend against them vigorously.\n \n8\nTable of Contents\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 71)\nYour receipt of the merger consideration for your shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas a taxable sale of your common stock (except in the case of certain non-U.S. stockholders noted below). Generally, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, you will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the merger consideration you receive\nand your adjusted tax basis in your shares. However, under certain circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger\nconsideration under applicable tax laws, and we intend to withhold a portion of the merger consideration paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders (who\ncould be treated as having effectively connected income subject to U.S. federal income tax) to the extent required under the Foreign Investment in\nReal Property Tax Act. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation.\nWe encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger to you. For further discussion, see \u201cMaterial U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 71.\nNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal (see page 71)\nWe are organized as a corporation under Maryland law. Under Section 3-202 of the MGCL, because our common stock was listed on the NYSE on\nthe record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, our common stockholders who object to the merger do not have\nany appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger. In addition, holders of our common\nstock may not exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s\nshares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such\nrights unless our Board determines that such rights apply. Our Board has made no such determination. However, our common stockholders can vote\nagainst the merger proposal.\nExpected Timing of the Merger\nWe anticipate completing the merger in the first quarter of 2022. However, the merger is subject to various conditions, and it is possible that factors\noutside of the control of CorePoint or Cavalier could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial\namount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all\nrequired clearances and approvals and the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the merger.\nNo Solicitation\u037e Acquisition Proposals (see page 82)\nExcept as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, from November 6, 2021 until the effective time or, if

If the merger is consummated, each share of CorePoint\ncommon stock will automatically be cancelled and you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving entity.\n \nQ.\nWhat will I receive in the merger if it is completed?\n \nA.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, you will have the right to receive, without interest and\nsubject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii) if applicable, incremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if\nCorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings, which we refer to as the \u201cIRS matter,\u201d with the IRS related to an\nongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to CorePoint\u2019s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of\nany dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger determined by\nCorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint\u2019s qualification for taxation as a REIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to\nbe paid (collectively, the \u201cper share merger consideration\u201d), for each share of CorePoint common stock that you own. The amount of such potential\nadditional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock is determined based on the amount, if any, by which the\nsettlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million.\nCorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021, and has entered into a definitive agreement\nwith the IRS on the basis of such offer on November 29, 2021, which remains subject to the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, as\ndescribed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Merger Consideration\u2014What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 34. There can be no assurances that any additional consideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock. You will not\nbe entitled to receive shares in the surviving entity or in Cavalier. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Merger\nConsideration\u2014What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 34 and the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014IRS\nMatter\u201d beginning on page 92.\n \n16Table of Contents\nQ.\nWhere and when is the special meeting, who may attend and can I ask questions?\n \nA.\nThe special meeting will be held virtually on March 1, 2022. The meeting will be held by live online webcast and will begin at 9:00 a.m., Central Time.\nOnly holders of record of CorePoint common stock as of the close of business on January 14, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, or their\nlegal proxy holders may attend the virtual special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

Each share of CorePoint common\nstock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 59,136,507 shares\nof CorePoint common stock issued and outstanding. All holders of record of CorePoint preferred stock at the close of business on the record date\nare entitled to notice of, but may not vote at, the virtual special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat matters will be voted on at the special meeting?\n \nA.\nAt the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n \n \n\u2022\n the merger proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the adjournment proposal.\n \nQ.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\n \nA.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote:\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\n \nQ.\nWhat vote is required to approve the merger proposal?\n \nA.\nThe merger proposal will be approved if CorePoint stockholders holding a majority of all the outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock\napprove the merger proposal.\n \nQ.\nWhat vote is required to approve the other proposals?\n \nA.\nApproval of each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote\nof a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on such proposal. Whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting, the meeting may\nnonetheless be adjourned by the chairperson of the meeting.\n \n17\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nHow are CorePoint\u2019s directors and executives intending to vote?\n \nA.\nAs of January 14, 2022, the directors and executive officers of CorePoint either directly or through their affiliates, collectively, beneficially owned\nand were entitled to vote 2,490,944 shares of CorePoint common stock, representing approximately 4.2% of the shares of CorePoint common stock\noutstanding on that date. CorePoint currently expects that these directors and executive officers will vote such shares of CorePoint common stock\nin favor of the merger proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them has entered into any\nagreement obligating them to do so.\n \nQ.\nHave any stockholders agreed to approve the merger?\n \nA.\nIn addition to CorePoint\u2019s directors and officers, concurrently with and as a condition to Cavalier\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s execution of the merger\nagreement, certain entities affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (such entities, collectively, the \u201cBlackstone parties\u201d), have entered into a support\nagreement with Cavalier (the \u201csupport agreement\u201d) covering shares of CorePoint common stock legally or beneficially owned by the Blackstone\nparties. Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the support agreement, the Blackstone parties have agreed to vote all of the\nCorePoint common stock owned by them in favor of the merger. As of November 6, 2021, the Blackstone parties owned 17,586,538 shares of\nCorePoint common stock representing approximately 30% of the total issued and outstanding shares of CorePoint common stock.\n \nQ.\nWhat factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the merger agreement and recommending the approval of the merger proposal, the\nnamed executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal?\n \nA.\nIn reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and declare the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nadvisable, and to recommend our stockholders approve the merger proposal, the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\nand the adjournment proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of\nthe proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed\ndescription of these factors, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 47 of this proxy\nstatement.\n \nQ.\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\n \nA.\nYes. The receipt of cash in exchange for our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nYou should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of our common stock for cash\npursuant to the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other\ntax laws). For further discussion, see \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 71.\n \nQ.\nWhat other effects will the merger have on CorePoint?\n \nA.\nIf the merger is completed, CorePoint common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and CorePoint will no\nlonger be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to CorePoint common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law,\nrules and regulations. Following the completion of the merger, CorePoint common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer\nhave any interest in CorePoint\u2019s future earnings or growth\u037e each share of CorePoint common stock you hold will represent only the right to receive\nthe merger consideration in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\n \n18\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\n \nA.\nAssuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of the merger proposal, the parties to the\nmerger agreement expect to complete the merger in the first quarter of 2022. However, CorePoint cannot assure completion by any particular date, if\nat all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of stockholder approval of the merger proposal, the exact\ntiming of the merger cannot be determined at this time and we cannot guarantee that the merger will be completed.\n \nQ.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\n \nA.\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of CorePoint common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain an\nindependent public company and shares of CorePoint common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the\nExchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Cavalier a\ntermination fee upon the termination of $29 million, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 99. Under\nspecified circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Cavalier may be required to pay us a termination fee of $58 million, as described\nunder \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d.\n \nQ.\nDo any of CorePoint\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a stockholder?\n \nA.\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our executive officers and\ndirectors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or partner, have interests in the merger that may be different\nfrom, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these differing interests, to the extent\nsuch interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending\nthat the merger be approved by CorePoint common stockholders. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 61.\n \nQ.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal?\n \nA.\nThe SEC rules require CorePoint to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to\nCorePoint\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\nis not required to complete the merger.\n \nQ.\nWho is soliciting my vote?\n \nA.\nThe Board is soliciting your proxy, and CorePoint will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of\nproxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $40,000, plus a contingent success fee of $20,000, subject to potential increase in certain circumstances,\nand will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and related services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation\ninitially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks, or other nominees to beneficial\nowners of shares of CorePoint common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies\nmay also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional\ncompensation, by certain of CorePoint\u2019s directors, officers and employees.\n \n19\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA.\nCarefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including the attached annexes.\nWhether or not you expect to attend the virtual special meeting in person, please submit a proxy (or provide instructions to your bank, broker, or\nother nominee, as applicable) to vote your shares as promptly as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the special\nmeeting.\n \nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?\n \nA.\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc.), you are considered a\n\u201cstockholder of record\u201d and there are four methods by which you may vote your shares or have your shares voted at the special meeting:\n \n \n\u2022\n Internet: To submit a proxy to vote over the internet, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the steps outlined on the secured website.\nPlease have your proxy card in hand when you access the website and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an\nelectronic voting instruction form.

You may still attend the\nmeeting and vote virtually if you have already submitted a proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to\nvote by submitting a proxy over the internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a\nproxy card by mail. If you return your signed proxy card to us or vote by submitting your proxy by telephone or over the internet before the special\nmeeting, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, we will vote your shares as you direct in such proxy.\nIf you return an executed proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote with regard to a particular proposal, your shares of CorePoint common\nstock will be voted in favor of such proposal.\n \nQ.\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker, bank or other nominee?\n \nA.\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you will\nreceive a vote instruction form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If you\nare a beneficial owner of shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the virtual special meeting, you must\nbring to the virtual special meeting a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares authorizing you to vote in person at\nthe virtual special meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take several days.\n \n20\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nCan I change or revoke my proxy after it has been submitted?\n \nA.\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you\nmay change or revoke your proxy by:\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting another proxy over the internet or by telephone prior to 10:59 p.m., Central Time, on February 28, 2022\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n timely delivering a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Secretary\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n attending the virtual special meeting and voting virtually. Simply attending the virtual special meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.\nIf you are the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other\nnominee to change or revoke your voting instructions provided to such broker, bank or other nominee.\n \nQ.\nHow many shares of CorePoint common stock must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?\n \nA.\nThe presence at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of CorePoint common\nstock issued and outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for\nbusiness to be conducted at the special meeting. If no quorum is present at the special meeting, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the\nspecial meeting to another place, date or time. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or\npostponement of the special meeting and may subject CorePoint to additional expense. As of the close of business on the record date, there were\n59,136,507 shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding. Accordingly, 29,568,254 shares of CorePoint common stock must be present or\nrepresented by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum. If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the internet\nor by telephone, or submit a ballot virtually at the special meeting (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares of\nCorePoint common stock will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\n \nQ.\nWhat if I abstain from voting on any proposal? What if I do not vote?\n \nA.\nFor the merger proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Abstentions will not count as votes cast for or against the merger\nproposal, but will still count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, the vote to approve the merger proposal is\nbased on the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding on the record date. As a result, if you abstain, or if you fail to vote (or\nsubmit voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, in the case of \u201cstreet name\u201d shares), it will have the same effect as if you vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the merger proposal.\nFor the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, you may vote \u201cFOR,\u201d \u201cAGAINST\u201d or\n\u201cABSTAIN.\u201d Each of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires for its approval the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting on the matter. Abstentions do not count as a \u201cvote cast\u201d under Maryland law.\nAs a result, assuming a quorum is present, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other\nnominee on how to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock will result in such shares not being counted for purposes of determining the\npresence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the\nadjournment proposal.\n \n21\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone or over the internet or in person at the virtual special\nmeeting?\n \nA.\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you do not attend the virtual special meeting or sign and return your proxy card, vote by submitting your\nproxy by telephone or vote by submitting your proxy over the internet, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted\nas present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the special\nmeeting will have no effect on the outcome of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\nHowever, the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock outstanding as of the close\nof business on the record date. As a result, if you fail to return your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\n \nQ.\nWhat is a broker non-vote? If I hold my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my shares for me on the proposals\nto be considered at the special meeting?\n \nA.\nBroker non-votes involve shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by brokers, banks and other nominees that are present or represented by proxy at the special\nmeeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a\nparticular proposal and such broker, bank or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Under NYSE rules, brokers,\nbanks and other nominees holding shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals\ndescribed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, if a beneficial owner of shares of CorePoint common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give\nvoting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the three proposals, then those shares will not be counted as\npresent virtually or by proxy at the special meeting (including for purposes of determining a quorum). Because all three proposals are non-\ndiscretionary matters, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes at the special meeting\u037e however, it is possible that a broker non-vote\ncould occur with respect to one or more of the proposals to the extent that voting instructions are given to a broker, bank or other nominee with\nrespect to at least one but less than all of the proposals. Because the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of\nCorePoint common stock outstanding on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee or if a broker\nnon-vote occurs with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. To the extent that you\nfail to issue voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee or a broker non-vote occurs with respect to the named executive officer\nmerger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the outcome of such proposals because such shares\nare not votes cast.\n \nQ.\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\n \nA.\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record,\nany shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various\nregistered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and\nreturn, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or\nbusiness entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules\ngoverning the account.\n \nQ.\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\n \nA.\nIf your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card.\nPlease complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies over the internet or by\ntelephone) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\n \n22\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nAm I entitled to exercise dissenters\u2019 rights under the MGCL instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares of CorePoint\ncommon stock?\n \nA.\nNo. You are not entitled to appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder in connection with the merger under\nMaryland law because the CorePoint common stock was listed on the NYSE on the record date. In addition, common stockholders may not exercise\nany appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder to receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection\nwith the merger because, as permitted by Maryland law, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless our\nBoard determines that the rights apply. Our Board has made no such determination. For additional information, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014No Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal\u201d beginning on page 71.\n \nQ.\nHow does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of CorePoint common stock prior to the public announcement of the\nmerger agreement? How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of CorePoint common stock as of a recent trading date?\n \nA.\nThe merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter)\nrepresents a premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint\u2019s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day prior to CorePoint\u2019s public\nannouncement of its strategic alternatives process. The merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that\nmay be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a 11.9% discount to the closing price of $17.76 per share of CorePoint common stock on\nNovember 5, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed merger. On January 13, 2022, the last practicable day\nbefore the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of CorePoint common stock on the NYSE was $15.68 per share. You are encouraged to\nobtain current market quotations for CorePoint common stock.\n \nQ.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of CorePoint common stock before the completion of the merger?\n \nA.\nIf you transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. In\norder to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of CorePoint common stock through the effective time of the merger. The\nrecord date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date the merger is anticipated to be consummated.\nAccordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special\narrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of\nyou notifies CorePoint in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is\nconsummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock, but you will have retained your right to vote\nthese shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of CorePoint common stock after the record date, we\nencourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the internet or telephone. \n \nQ.\nWhat is a proxy?\n \nA.\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock. The written\ndocument describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to\ndesignate a proxy to vote your shares of CorePoint common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\n \nQ.\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\n \nA.\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the internet or telephone\n \n23\nTable of Contents\n \nprocess or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d or to abstain from voting on all, some or\nnone of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing\nhow your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal\u037e\n(ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\n \nQ.\nWho will count the votes obtained at the special meeting?\n \nA.\nThe votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat will the holders of CorePoint Stock Units and PSUs receive in the merger?\n \nA.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, as of the effective time, each outstanding CorePoint Stock Unit will become immediately vested and be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (i) the total number of shares subject to such Stock Unit,\nmultiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the terms of any\napplicable Stock Unit award agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld under applicable law.\nIn addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, as of the effective time, each outstanding PSU will become immediately vested and be cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (i) the number of shares subject to such PSU, calculated based on\nthe greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with the terms of such PSU, and (B) the target level\nperformance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents provided under the\nterms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes required to be withheld by applicable law.\n \nQ.\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\n \nA.\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with\nrespect to two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering a single proxy statement to those stockholders, unless contrary instructions\nhave been received. This procedure reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs\nfor companies. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If\nyour family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. You may\ndecide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies of proxy materials.

        "Section Text": "Merger Consideration \u2014 What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger\nAdjustments to the Merger Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, CorePoint\ncommon stockholders will have the right to receive, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, (i) $15.65 in cash plus (ii), if applicable,\nincremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if CorePoint resolves prior to the closing the previously disclosed tax proceedings,\nwhich we refer to as the \u201cIRS Matter,\u201d with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) related to an ongoing audit of CorePoint entities in existence prior to\nCorePoint\u2019s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., less (iii) the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the date of\nthe merger agreement and the effective time of the merger determined by CorePoint to be necessary to maintain CorePoint\u2019s qualification for taxation as a\nREIT, although CorePoint does not expect any such dividends to be paid, as further discussed below (collectively, the \u201cper share merger consideration\u201d),\nfor each share of CorePoint common stock that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any cancelled shares or\nconverted shares or Restricted Stock (as defined below)).\nIRS Closing Agreement. The payment of any such additional cash consideration, as described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph\nentitled \u201cAdjustments to Merger Consideration\u201d above, is dependent on CorePoint entering into a definitive closing agreement with the IRS prior to the\nclosing. The amount of such potential additional cash consideration, if any, payable to holders of CorePoint common stock is determined based on the\namount, if any, by which the settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less\nthan $160 million. CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021. On the basis of such offer,\nCorePoint entered into a settlement agreement on Form 870-AD with the IRS on November 29, 2021 (the \u201cNovember 29 Closing Agreement\u201d), which\nprovides for total payments by CorePoint of approximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment to the IRS. Pursuant to the\nNovember 29 Closing Agreement, the total payment amount for the settlement of the IRS Matter is dependent on the calculation of interest by the IRS,\nwhich includes a determination by the IRS of the applicable statutory interest rates and applicable time periods, and the date on which the settlement\npayment (including interest as calculated by the IRS) is made to the IRS. As a result, CorePoint cannot determine the total payment amount with\nspecificity as of the date of this proxy statement. However, pursuant to the November 29 Closing Agreement, based on the foregoing and assuming that\nCorePoint makes the settlement payment to the IRS on or about the date of the effective time of the merger, CorePoint currently estimates that the amount\nof any such additional consideration will likely be between approximately $0.10 per share and approximately $0.35 per share, although there can be no\nassurance that any such additional consideration will fall within that range. Following receipt by CorePoint of the determination by the IRS of the\napplicable statutory interest rate and calculation by the IRS of the interest payable, CorePoint expects to inform the holders of CorePoint common stock\nof the expected amount of any additional consideration as determined based on such calculation by the IRS. In connection with the closing, CorePoint\nexpects to inform the holders of CorePoint of the definitive amount of any such additional consideration. There can be no assurances that any additional\nconsideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock. CorePoint\u2019s entry into any IRS settlement is not a condition to the closing of\nthe merger.\n \n34Table of Contents\nSpecial Dividend. The potential reduction of the cash consideration by the per share amount of any dividends paid to common stockholders between the\ndate of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, as described in clause (iii) of the paragraph entitled \u201cAdjustments to Merger\nConsideration\u201d above, is dependent on CorePoint determining the payment of such dividends to be necessary to maintain CorePoint\u2019s qualification for\ntaxation as a REIT. CorePoint does not currently expect the payment of any such dividend prior\nto the effective time of the merger to be necessary to maintain CorePoint\u2019s qualification for taxation as a REIT, and as such does not currently expect any\ncorresponding reduction of the cash consideration as a result of such dividend.",

        "Section Text": "Effects on CorePoint if the Merger Is Not Completed\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by CorePoint stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, CorePoint stockholders will not\nreceive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, CorePoint will remain an independent public company and shares of\nCorePoint common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic\nreports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, CorePoint expects that management will operate CorePoint\u2019s business in a manner similar\nto that in which it is being operated today and that CorePoint stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they\nare currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the highly competitive industry in which CorePoint operates and adverse economic\nconditions. Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is\nlikely that the price of CorePoint\u2019s common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of CorePoint\u2019s\ncommon stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be\nno assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of CorePoint\u2019s common stock.\nFurther, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, CorePoint may be required to pay Cavalier a termination fee of $29\nmillion or Cavalier may be required to pay CorePoint a\n \n35Table of Contents\ntermination fee of $58 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 99 for a discussion of the circumstances under which\nsuch fee may be payable.",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nSince CorePoint\u2019s 2018 spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc., the Board and CorePoint\u2019s senior management have regularly reviewed and assessed\nCorePoint\u2019s operations and financial performance, industry conditions and related developments as they may impact CorePoint\u2019s long-term strategic\nplans and objectives. As part of this ongoing evaluation, the Board, together with CorePoint\u2019s executive management team, has considered various\npotential strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value, which have from time to time included evaluations of potential acquisitions or\ndispositions of properties (including the ongoing disposition of non-core assets), and other potential financial and strategic alternatives.\nIn furtherance of its consideration of these types of potential strategic alternatives, the Board and CorePoint\u2019s senior management have discussed a\nnumber of such alternatives with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Hodges Ward Elliot, LLC (\u201cHWE\u201d) from time to time, including during periods\nwithout any formal engagements. CorePoint has sought advice from these advisors for a number of reasons that include J.P. Morgan\u2019s and HWE\u2019s\nexperience and expertise as financial advisors in a wide variety of transactions and familiarity with CorePoint\u2019s business, including, in the case of J.P.\nMorgan, J.P. Morgan\u2019s work as financial advisor to La Quinta Holdings Inc. in connection with the 2018 acquisition of La Quinta Holdings Inc. by\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (\u201cWyndham\u201d) and the related spin-off of CorePoint from La Quinta Holdings Inc. In connection with the process that\nled to the proposed merger, CorePoint discussed strategic alternatives with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE throughout the course of the events\nin 2021 described below, and CorePoint formally entered into engagement letters with J.P. Morgan and HWE as its financial advisors effective as of July\n13, 2021 in connection with a potential sale of, or other significant strategic transaction involving, CorePoint. CorePoint has also worked with Simpson\nThacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d) from time to time since the completion of the spin-off from La Quinta Holdings Inc. CorePoint discussed\nvarious matters and the process that led to the proposed merger with representatives of Simpson Thacher throughout the course of the events in 2021\ndescribed below.\nThroughout the first half of 2021, CorePoint continued to pursue the completion of its ongoing non-core disposition program, which it had commenced in\nMarch 2019, with respect to the sale of its non-core hotel properties as identified in a strategic review of its portfolio. During this period, the Board and\nthe Capital Committee of the Board (the \u201cCapital Committee\u201d), respectively, held bi-weekly regularly scheduled update calls during alternating weeks, with\nrepresentatives of CorePoint management in attendance, to discuss the status of the disposition program and related matters concerning the operations\nand strategy of CorePoint. Also, from time to time throughout the first half of 2021, representatives of CorePoint management and the Capital Committee\nhad a number of informal discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, related to the state of the lodging industry generally,\ncertain of CorePoint\u2019s peer companies, CorePoint\u2019s disposition strategy and potential strategic alternatives that CorePoint might pursue.\nOn April 27, 2021, the Capital Committee held a telephonic update call with representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of CorePoint management\nin attendance, and a telephonic update call with representatives of HWE and representatives of CorePoint management in attendance. During such calls,\nmembers of the Capital Committee discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, the current state of the lodging industry\ngenerally, the Board\u2019s belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate and lodging markets were generally favorable, certain preliminary\nvaluation and financial information concerning certain lodging companies, a review of CorePoint\u2019s asset portfolio and current non-core disposition\nstrategy, certain preliminary projections prepared by CorePoint management concerning CorePoint\u2019s future operating performance and certain potential\nstrategic alternatives that CorePoint might pursue. The potential strategic alternatives discussed during these calls included scenarios in which CorePoint\nwould maintain its current strategy by continuing to sell non-core assets and retaining the CorePoint Core Portfolio, continuing to sell non-core assets\nbut apply the\n \n36Table of Contents\nrelated proceeds in an effort to grow the CorePoint Core Portfolio, potentially seeking to amend its management relationship with Wyndham, or pursuing\na sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction or in connection with a liquidation of CorePoint, of all of its properties (including the CorePoint Core\nPortfolio). Representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, discussed with the Capital Committee a number of considerations associated with the\npossible exploration of a change in control transaction or other strategic alternatives, which considerations included investor sentiment in light of, among\nother things, then-current market trends in the lodging industry and in the economy generally (including trends relating to vaccinations against COVID-\n19, increases in travel and overall industry demand), CorePoint\u2019s credit profile and the financing market generally, the status and potential resolution of\nthe IRS Matter (as defined in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014IRS Matter\u201d beginning on page 72) and the status of, and implications regarding, the\nmanagement agreements with Wyndham.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher in\nattendance. Representatives of CorePoint management provided the Board with an overview of CorePoint\u2019s results of operations for the first quarter of\n2021 and the status of CorePoint\u2019s non-core asset disposition program. Members of the Capital Committee provided the Board with an overview of their\nrecent discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, and members of the Board discussed with CorePoint management various\nconsiderations associated with a possible exploration of a change in control transaction or other potential strategic alternatives, including recent positive\neconomic trends and depth of activity in the merger and acquisition market. Key considerations identified by the Board included the status of the IRS\nMatter and cooperation from Wyndham that would likely be necessary in connection with a potential change of control transaction, depending on the\nstructure of any such transaction and the intended treatment in such transaction of the management relationship between CorePoint and Wyndham.\nRepresentatives of CorePoint management provided the Board with an update on the most recent discussions with the appeals team of the IRS that had\noccurred earlier that month in connection with the IRS Matter, including related expected timelines for various possible resolutions of the IRS Matter.\nFollowing discussion, upon consultation with the Board\u2019s advisors, members of the Board expressed the view that it could be in the best interest of\nCorePoint stockholders for CorePoint to explore a potential change in control transaction in the near term in light of the then-current circumstances,\nincluding CorePoint\u2019s scale, recent trends in the hotel industry and economic indicators, and CorePoint management\u2019s preliminary view of CorePoint\u2019s\nstandalone forecasts, pending further review and confirmation of those forecasts. The Board instructed CorePoint management to review CorePoint\nmanagement\u2019s standalone forecasts.\nOn May 18, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher in\nattendance. Representatives of Simpson Thacher discussed with the members of the Board a number of considerations and potential decision points in\nconnection with a possible continued evaluation by the Board of potential strategic alternatives for CorePoint, and reminded the members of the Board of\ntheir duties under applicable law.\nOver the balance of May and into June, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of CorePoint management worked with representatives of J.P.\nMorgan to review CorePoint management\u2019s standalone forecasts and to discuss potential strategic alternatives for CorePoint.\nOn June 1, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management met in Irving, Texas, with representatives of J.P. Morgan participating telephonically, to review\nCorePoint management\u2019s standalone forecasts and to discuss key assumptions underlying such forecasts, including with respect to trends in the hotel\nREIT industry. All members of the Board were invited to join the meeting and several members of the Board participated in person, and the Board was\ninformed that the full Board was going to be updated on the discussions and have the opportunity to review such forecasts and discuss such\nassumptions at the meeting of the Board that was scheduled for June 21, 2021.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson\nThacher in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint management\n \n37\nTable of Contents\npresented to the Board three standalone forecasts for CorePoint, consisting of a base plan and two growth plans, all of which had been prepared by\nCorePoint management and reviewed on June 1, 2021 with various members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan. The Board reviewed these\nstandalone forecasts with representatives of J.P. Morgan and representatives of CorePoint management. All three forecasts assumed that CorePoint\nwould sell all of its properties other than the CorePoint Core Portfolio, and the two growth plans also further assumed the use of debt capital following\nthese dispositions to acquire additional core properties. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management the forecasts\npresented, including the potential value creation opportunity of each of these plans, key underlying assumptions utilized in preparing the plans and\nperspectives with respect to market trends. The Board also discussed potential next steps in connection with the potential evaluation of strategic\nalternatives, as well as the potential impact of the IRS Matter and the management relationship with Wyndham on any such strategic alternatives.\nOn June 24, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and\nCorePoint\u2019s tax counsel in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel discussed with the Board the status of the IRS Matter, as well as the\npotential implications of certain strategic options available to CorePoint relating to the IRS Matter, including with respect to the expected timing of a\npotential resolution and various outcome possibilities, the likelihood of a potential settlement, and potential impacts of such outcomes on CorePoint and\nits stockholders, both in connection with the operation of CorePoint on a standalone basis, as well as in connection with any potential process for the\nevaluation of strategic alternatives.\nOn July 6, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE, respectively, presented their respective preliminary financial analyses of\nCorePoint based on the forecasts prepared by CorePoint management. At the instruction of the Board, J.P. Morgan and HWE referred to the base plan\nprepared by CorePoint management, which constituted the CorePoint Projections (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financial Projections\u201d\nbeginning on page 58 of this proxy statement), for purposes of their respective analyses with respect to the potential transaction, which the Board\nconsidered to be the most appropriate of the three plans prepared by CorePoint management for such purposes in light of the Board\u2019s view of CorePoint\u2019s\nbusiness and underlying factors such as trends in the hotel REIT industry. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nHWE, respectively, their respective preliminary analyses as well as various potential alternatives available to CorePoint after the completion of the\ndisposition of its non-core assets, both with respect to the continued operation on a standalone basis as well as with respect to the disposition of all of\nthe CorePoint properties (including the CorePoint Core Portfolio) in a sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction, or in connection with a liquidation\nof CorePoint. Members of the Board discussed with CorePoint\u2019s legal and financial advisors various considerations relating to a potential sale, including\ninvestor sentiment for the lodging sector, availability of debt financing for a potential acquiror, the status and likelihood of a potential resolution of the\nIRS Matter, and cooperation from Wyndham that would likely be necessary in connection with such a transaction. Consistent with previous discussions,\nmembers of the Board expressed the view that any potential acquiror of CorePoint would likely need to conduct extensive due diligence with respect to\nthe IRS Matter and that it could be beneficial to CorePoint and its stockholders in connection with a potential sale process to have certainty as to the\npotential exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter. Members of the Board also discussed with its legal and financial advisors risks and\nbenefits of a broad auction process as opposed to a targeted solicitation of potential buyers, and risks and benefits of a public announcement of the\nexploration of strategic alternatives in connection with such a process, as well as potential timelines and work streams. Following discussion, the Board\ndetermined to further explore strategic alternatives and to publicly announce that CorePoint was engaging in such exploration of strategic alternatives.\nThe Board also determined that in connection with this strategic review process, CorePoint\u2019s tax advisors should explore the amount, if any, at which the\nIRS may be interested in making a settlement proposal to CorePoint.\nOver the course of the following months, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint\u2019s tax advisors continued to work with the IRS appeals team in order to\nascertain the amount, if any, at which the IRS would be prepared to make a settlement proposal to CorePoint.\n \n38\nTable of Contents\nOn July 8, 2021, CorePoint submitted a request for post-appeals mediation with respect to the IRS Matter to the IRS appeals team.\nOn July 13, 2021, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint publicly announced that it had decided to explore strategic alternatives to maximize\nstockholder value.\nAlso on July 13, 2021, CorePoint entered into engagement letters with J.P. Morgan and HWE.\nOver the course of July and August 2021, at the instruction of the Board, CorePoint management and its advisors engaged with potential acquirors,\nprepared process letters, confidentiality agreements and information materials, established a virtual data room, conducted management presentations and\nsite visits, and prepared drafts of definitive transaction documents.\nDuring this time, representatives of J.P. Morgan and HWE reached out to, or were approached by, approximately 70 potential acquirors of CorePoint. Of\nthose parties, approximately 52 initially requested to enter into a confidentiality agreement, and 41 parties, including Highgate Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHighgate\u201d)\nand Cerberus Capital Management (\u201cCerberus\u201d), executed confidentiality agreements with CorePoint, all of which included certain standstill provisions\nthat automatically fell away upon the announcement of the proposed merger.\nOn July 26, 2021, the IRS appeals team issued a letter denying CorePoint\u2019s request for post-appeals mediation with respect to the IRS Matter.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and\nCorePoint\u2019s tax counsel in attendance. Representatives of CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel discussed with the Board the status of the IRS Matter, the recent denial\nby the IRS of CorePoint\u2019s request for post-appeals mediation, certain potential approaches available to CorePoint and the potential implications thereof,\nand expectations regarding the timing of a potential resolution through litigation in tax court or through other IRS audit resolutions. Members of the\nBoard also discussed potential impacts of various outcomes on CorePoint and its stockholders, both in connection with the operation of CorePoint on a\nstandalone basis as well as with respect to the ongoing auction process in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives for CorePoint.\nFrom time to time following the public announcement of CorePoint\u2019s exploration of strategic alternatives, representatives of Wyndham management\ncontacted representatives of CorePoint management to discuss the potential impact of a change of control transaction on the management relationship\nbetween Wyndham and CorePoint. Throughout this time, representatives of CorePoint management and members of the Board had a number of\ndiscussions with CorePoint\u2019s advisors with respect to these matters and determined that it could be beneficial to CorePoint to coordinate with Wyndham\non this aspect of a transaction prior to any public announcement of a definitive agreement with respect to the potential sale of CorePoint. Upon\nconsultation with CorePoint\u2019s advisors, CorePoint management determined that it would engage in more formal discussions with Wyndham if the sales\nprocess were to advance to a second round.\nBeginning on August 2, 2021, CorePoint provided the parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements with access to CorePoint\u2019s virtual data\nroom and first-round due diligence information, including the CorePoint Projections (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financial\nProjections\u201d beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement) for fiscal year 2021, and only for fiscal year 2021. In addition, on August 10, 2021,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan sent to the parties that had entered into confidentiality agreements a process letter instructing such parties to submit initial\nindications of interests by August 31, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, nine bidders submitted first-round non-binding indications of interest. These bidders included Highgate, a consortium consisting of\nthree parties which we hereafter refer to as Party A, and a bidder whom we hereafter refer to as Party B. At the instruction of CorePoint, J.P. Morgan and\nHWE had instructed the bidders not to assign a value to CorePoint\u2019s potential liabilities arising from the IRS Matter in connection with these initial\nindications of interest. Cerberus did not submit a separate indication of interest, but representatives of Highgate contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan\nto request that Highgate be permitted to cooperate with Cerberus as an equity financing source in connection with the process going forward.\n \n39\nTable of Contents\nOn September 1, 2021, the Capital Committee held a telephonic update call with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, HWE and Simpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Capital Committee regarding the status of\nthe auction process and reviewed with the Capital Committee the first-round non-binding indications of interest received from the nine bidders. Members\nof the Capital Committee and representatives of CorePoint management discussed with their advisors the terms of these indications of interest. The\nCapital Committee also discussed the risks and benefits relating to potential resolutions of the IRS Matter prior to the completion of the process, if any,\nand the approach towards an engagement with Wyndham. Following discussion, the Capital Committee determined to recommend to the Board that\nCorePoint should proceed to the second round of the sale process.\nOn September 3, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an update to the Board regarding the status of the auction process and\nreviewed with the Board the first-round non-binding indications of interest received from the nine bidders. Members of the Board discussed with\nCorePoint\u2019s advisors and representatives of CorePoint management the terms of these indications of interest, as well as various requests from certain\nbidders for permission to cooperate with other counterparties, including potential equity or debt financing sources or operating partners, and the\npotential impact thereof on second-round indications of interests. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with the Board certain considerations\nrelating to timing and strategy for the potential second round of the process and the responses to be delivered to the various bidders. The Board\nconsidered risks and benefits of a potential sale of CorePoint as compared to risks and benefits associated with possible strategic alternatives and\nCorePoint\u2019s long-term strategic plan as an independent public company. Also at this meeting, the Board discussed the status of CorePoint\u2019s non-core\nasset dispositions, the likelihood of a potential resolution of the IRS Matter, and the approach towards an engagement with Wyndham. As it relates to the\nIRS Matter, the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the due diligence that second-round bidders would need\nto perform with respect to the IRS Matter in order to evaluate and attempt to quantify the expected exposure, and potential options to allocate risk relating\nto the IRS Matter between CorePoint and a potential acquiror or to otherwise provide certainty as to the amount of any liability relating to the IRS Matter.\nFollowing discussion, the Board instructed management and its advisors to invite the six bidders with the highest proposed valuations, including\nHighgate, Party A and Party B, to proceed to the second round of the process, to make available to such parties additional information in CorePoint\u2019s\nvirtual data room and drafts of the definitive transaction agreements. Upon consultation with its advisors, the Board determined to permit Highgate to\ncooperate with Cerberus as an equity financing source in connection with the process going forward. The Board also determined to engage with\nWyndham with respect to the terms of any potential cooperation from Wyndham that might be beneficial to CorePoint in connection with a potential\nchange of control transaction and determined that it could be beneficial to the auction process if the amount of any liability relating to the IRS Matter\ncould be determined prior to the conclusion of the process, but the Board determined not to make a settlement offer to the IRS at such time.\nFollowing the meeting, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan invited the six selected bidders, including Highgate, Party A, and\nParty B, to the second round of the process, and authorized Highgate to cooperate with Cerberus in connection with its potential second-round\nindication of interest.\nAfter initiating the second round of the process, in September 2021, additional information was made available to the second-round bidders in\nCorePoint\u2019s virtual data room, including drafts of the definitive transaction agreements, and on October 1, 2021, at the instruction of the Board,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan sent to the second-round bidders a process letter, requesting second-round bids be submitted by October 15, 2021, which\ndate was subsequently extended to October 16, 2021.\nOn September 8, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of Simpson Thacher and\nCorePoint\u2019s tax counsel in attendance, at which representatives of CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel informed the Board of the status of the IRS Matter.\n \n40\nTable of Contents\nOn September 29, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Simpson\nThacher and CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of CorePoint management provided an update to the Board regarding\nthe status of the auction process and the status of discussions with Wyndham, and representatives of CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel informed the Board of the\nstatus of the IRS Matter.\nOver the course of September and up until the second-round bid deadline of October 16, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management conducted\nvarious due diligence calls with second-round bidders and their respective advisors. Throughout this process, various bidders expressed the need for\nclarity as to the proposed treatment of the management relationship between CorePoint and Wyndham in connection with a potential transaction. During\nthis time, at the instruction of the Board, representatives of CorePoint management discussed with representatives of Wyndham management the\npotential terms of the parties\u2019 cooperation in connection with a potential change of control transaction of CorePoint. Also during this period of time, the\nsecond-round bidders and their respective advisors engaged in tax due diligence with respect to the IRS Matter, including due diligence calls with\nCorePoint\u2019s tax counsel and tax advisors. CorePoint made available documentation intended to enable bidders to evaluate and attempt to quantify the\npotential exposure resulting from the IRS Matter, which documentation, in CorePoint\u2019s view, supported a conclusion that, although CorePoint intended to\npursue litigation with respect to the IRS Matter, it would be reasonable for a bidder to assume the exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter\nwas unlikely to exceed approximately $160 million.\nIn addition, representatives of CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel continued to work with the IRS appeals team in an effort to explore the amount, if any, at which the\nIRS would be willing to make a settlement proposal with respect to the IRS Matter.\nThroughout this period, the Board and the Capital Committee continued to hold bi-weekly update calls on alternating weeks, during which members of\nthe Board and the Capital Committee discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the status of the sales process, the IRS\nMatter and the discussions with Wyndham.  \nOn October 7, 2021, representatives of counsel to Highgate/Cerberus and representatives of counsel to Party A, respectively, submitted draft markups of\nthe definitive transaction agreements to Simpson Thacher, and representatives of counsel to Party B provided high level reactions to the draft transaction\nagreements to Simpson Thacher.\nOn October 11, 2021, following discussions with representatives of CorePoint management and members of the Board, at the instruction of CorePoint,\nrepresentatives of Simpson Thacher provided feedback to counsel to Highgate/Cerberus and counsel to Party A, respectively, with respect to their\nproposed markups of the transaction agreements.\nOn October 12, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management, members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson Thacher\ndiscussed the terms of a potential non-binding letter of intent with Wyndham and its potential impact on the second-round process and the timing of\nsecond-round indications of interest, which were due later that week.\nOn October 14, 2021, CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham entered into a non-binding letter of intent providing, among other things, that upon the\nconsummation of a change of control of CorePoint, all remaining hotel management agreements would be terminated, all franchise agreements would be\ntransferred or replaced with new La Quinta franchise agreements, Wyndham would cooperate with CorePoint in facilitating the proposed transaction and\nwinding down the management relationship between the parties, and CorePoint would pay to Wyndham or its affiliates certain termination fees of\napproximately $84 million. At the instruction of CorePoint, representatives of J.P. Morgan made available to the second-round bidders a copy of the\nexecuted non-binding letter of intent prior to the submission of second-round indications of interest.\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nBetween October 15, 2021 and October 16, 2021, each of Highgate/Cerberus, Party A and Party B submitted second-round non-binding indications of\ninterest and draft markups of the transaction agreements, which, in the case of each of Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, reflected improvements of certain\nkey terms in response to the feedback delivered by representatives of Simpson Thacher based on their respective initial drafts. Each of the bidders also\nrequested to enter into a support agreement with the Blackstone parties pursuant to which the Blackstone parties would agree to vote their shares in\nfavor of a potential transaction. Each of the other three parties that had been invited into the second round of the process informed representatives of J.P.\nMorgan that it did not intend to submit a second-round indication of interest. The valuations proposed by Highgate/Cerberus and Party A were each\nhigher than the valuation proposed by Party B. The Highgate/Cerberus proposal at this time was for $14.42 per share in cash, after taking into account the\nadjustment for the IRS Matter. For purposes of their second round bids, taking into account the due diligence documentation made available to bidders\nby CorePoint as discussed above, all three parties estimated the likely exposure to CorePoint resulting from the IRS Matter at approximately $160 million.\nDuring the course of the second round due diligence, bidders were encouraged to assume the risk of any liability arising from the IRS Matter in excess of\na specified amount and to provide CorePoint stockholders with the ability to receive incremental consideration if the IRS Matter was settled for an\namount less than any such specified amount.\nOn October 17, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board the three second-round non-binding indications of interests\nreceived, including the proposed valuations and proposed terms relating to the treatment of the IRS Matter. Representatives of CorePoint management\ndiscussed with the Board and CorePoint\u2019s advisers that all three bidders had expressed concern with respect to the potential liability arising from the IRS\nMatter and had determined to price in approximately $160 million for such exposure (which included potential interest payable to the IRS) when arriving at\ntheir proposed equity valuation. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the terms of the\nindications of interest, potential strategy relating to responses to the three bidders, the status of discussions with the IRS appeals team with respect to\nthe IRS Matter, the process for negotiating a definitive agreement with Wyndham, and the impact of the foregoing on the potential timing for the\nannouncement of a transaction.\nFollowing discussion at the October 17, 2021 meeting, the Board determined that each of Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, as the two bidders that had the\nhighest valuation proposals and that were the furthest along in terms of being prepared to execute definitive documentation and provide committed\nfinancing, should be invited to submit improved final proposals. The Board also instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to seek to finalize a\ndefinitive agreement with Wyndham and to continue to attempt to determine the amount, if any, at which the IRS would be willing to make a settlement\noffer with respect to the IRS Matter. Given the Board\u2019s desire for clarity as to the proposed approach with respect to the IRS Matter, the Board also\ninstructed representatives of J.P. Morgan and Simpson Thacher to inform the two final bidders that the Board requested each party to submit final\nproposals that met certain specified criteria regarding the treatment of the IRS Matter. These requests included the absence of any closing condition\nrelating to the IRS Matter\u037e the absence of any downside risk to CorePoint stockholders in the event the liability relating to the IRS Matter were to exceed\n$160 million\u037e and an ability for CorePoint stockholders to participate in the benefit of any settlement of the IRS Matter below the $160 million estimate that\nbidders had placed on such liability if such settlement were reached by or shortly following closing.\nDuring the week of October 18, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Highgate the terms of the Highgate/Cerberus\nindication of interest, particularly with respect to their proposed treatment of the IRS Matter. During such discussions, representatives of Highgate\ninformed J.P. Morgan that Highgate/Cerberus insisted on a closing condition regarding a settlement of the IRS Matter and a provision allocating any\nliability in excess of $160 million (including interest) to CorePoint stockholders, both of which provisions were inconsistent with the terms proposed by\nCorePoint at the request of the Board. Also during this week, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party A the terms of Party\nA\u2019s indication\n \n42\nTable of Contents\nof interest. During such discussions, representatives of Party A substantially accepted the terms proposed by CorePoint at the request of the Board\nregarding the IRS Matter. Also during this week, both Highgate/Cerberus and Party A submitted to J.P. Morgan revised indications of interest, each at an\nincreased valuation. By October 22, 2021, the Highgate/Cerberus proposal had been further increased, but the proposed consideration was subject to\ndecrease in connection with the IRS Matter if the liability thereunder exceeded $160 million, and the proposal contained a provision that would, in the\nabsence of a settlement of the IRS Matter, permit Highgate/Cerberus not to close the merger but instead acquire substantially all of the assets of\nCorePoint while CorePoint and its stockholders would retain the liability resulting from the IRS Matter. Party A had also further increased its proposal and\nthe difference between the two bidders\u2019 respective valuations at this time was not material, but Party A\u2019s proposal was not subject to decrease in\nconnection with the IRS Matter, and, as noted above, Party A had also substantially accepted the other terms proposed by CorePoint at the request of\nthe Board regarding the IRS Matter.\nOn October 22, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the status of the final\nround bid process, the negotiations with Wyndham and the likelihood of obtaining a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter.\nRepresentatives of Simpson Thacher reminded the members of the Board of their duties under applicable law. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed the\nBoard of the recent discussions with representatives of Party A and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus, respectively. In light of the more favorable\nterms presented by Party A with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board,\nupon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to work with Party A to finalize definitive agreements.\nOver the course of the following days and throughout the week of October 25, 2021, representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors worked\nwith representatives of Party A and its advisors to finalize definitive transaction agreements and with representatives of Wyndham to finalize a definitive\nagreement reflecting the October 14th letter of intent. Also during this time, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest, which reflected a valuation\nbelow the most recent indications of interest submitted by both Highgate/Cerberus and by Party A.\nDuring the week of October 25, 2021, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a draft support agreement to counsel to the Blackstone parties, which\nprovided, among other things, that the Blackstone parties would agree to vote their shares in favor of a transaction.\nAlso during the course of the week of October 25, 2021, Highgate/Cerberus submitted to J.P. Morgan a revised proposal at a modestly increased valuation\nbut which continued to provide that the consideration would be subject to decrease in connection with the IRS Matter if the liability thereunder exceeded\n$160 million, and the proposal continued to contain a provision that would, in the absence of a settlement of the IRS Matter, permit Highgate/Cerberus\nnot to close the merger but instead acquire substantially all of the assets of CorePoint while CorePoint and its stockholders would retain the liability\nresulting from the IRS Matter.\nOn October 27, 2021, the IRS appeals team proposed to schedule a call with CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel for November 5, 2021, relating to the possibility of a\nsettlement proposal from the IRS regarding the IRS Matter.\nOn October 28, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed again with the Board the revised indications of interest received from all three\nparties, including a discussion and comparison of the proposed valuations and the proposed treatment of the IRS Matter reflected in each proposal, and\nalso the recent trading performance of CorePoint common stock. The Board considered the fact that the closing price of CorePoint common stock had\nincreased significantly since CorePoint\u2019s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process and that the indications of interest received from all\nthree\n \n43\nTable of Contents\nparties reflected a discount to the most recent closing price per share of CorePoint common stock, but the Board noted that the indications of interest\nfrom Highgate/Cerberus and Party A both reflected a premium in excess of 30% to CorePoint\u2019s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day\nprior to CorePoint\u2019s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process. The most recent proposal from Highgate/Cerberus reflected a valuation\nthat was modestly higher than the proposal from Party A. However, the Highgate/Cerberus proposal remained subject to a closing condition with respect\nto an IRS settlement and provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, neither of which terms were reflected\nin Party A\u2019s proposal. Members of the Board discussed with representatives of CorePoint management and its advisors the indications of interest\nreceived, the status of the negotiation of definitive documents with Party A, which were nearly finalized, and the prospect of potentially obtaining a\nsettlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter during the upcoming November 5, 2021 call with the IRS appeals team. The Board determined\nto continue working with Party A in an effort to finalize mutually agreeable definitive documentation but not to enter into a definitive agreement with\nParty A prior to receiving an update from CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel immediately following the November 5, 2021 call with the IRS appeals team.\nAt the instruction of the Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed representatives of Party A of the Board\u2019s determination and the expected timing\nfor the potential announcement of a transaction. Over the course of the following days, representatives of CorePoint\u2019s advisors and representatives of\nParty A\u2019s advisers continued to work toward finalization of definitive transaction agreements.\nThere was no substantive communication between representatives of CorePoint and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus following the October 28, 2021\nBoard meeting until representatives from J.P. Morgan received a revised proposal from Highgate/Cerberus close to midnight on October 31, 2021. This\nproposal reflected the same valuation as the most recent Highgate/Cerberus proposal submitted during the week of October 25, 2021, removed the closing\ncondition relating to the settlement of the IRS matter, but retained provisions that provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint stockholders relating\nto the IRS Matter. Then, on November 1, 2021, representatives of counsel to Highgate/Cerberus submitted updated provisions to the draft transaction\ndocuments relating to the IRS Matter, which provisions continued to retain provisions that provided for economic downside risk to CorePoint\nstockholders relating to the IRS Matter and otherwise remained inconsistent with the terms relating to the IRS Matter previously proposed by CorePoint\nat the request of the Board and accepted by Party A.\nOn November 2, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board the revised indication from Highgate/Cerberus, which continued\nto reflect a valuation that was modestly higher than Party A\u2019s proposal. In light of the fact that the respective valuations of the two proposals were close\nto each other and that the terms presented by Party A continued to be more favorable with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to\nCorePoint stockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board, upon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to\ncontinue to work with Party A to finalize definitive agreements. In advance of the meeting, the Board was informed about certain relationships between\nJ.P. Morgan and its affiliates and Blackstone, Cerberus and Highgate, respectively, as described in more detail in \u201cThe Merger \u2013 Opinion of J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC\u201d on page 53.\nThere was no substantive communication between representatives of CorePoint and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus following the November 2,\n2021 Board meeting until Highgate/Cerberus submitted a further revised proposal on November 4, 2021. This proposal reflected an increased valuation,\nwhich was higher than the proposal from Party A, and representatives of Highgate/Cerberus suggested to representatives of J.P. Morgan that\nHighgate/Cerberus was now willing to accept the terms relating to the IRS Matter previously proposed by CorePoint at the request of the Board, which\nhad been accepted by Party A.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE and\nSimpson Thacher in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nreviewed with the Board the revised indication from Highgate/Cerberus. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board J.P. Morgan\u2019s\npreliminary financial analysis with respect to the indications of interest from Party A and from Highgate/Cerberus. Representatives of Simpson Thacher\nreminded the members of the Board of their duties under applicable law. In light of the higher purchase price proposed by Highgate/Cerberus, and the\nwillingness expressed by their representatives to accept more favorable terms with respect to conditionality and potential downside risk to CorePoint\nstockholders relating to the IRS Matter, the Board, upon consultation with its advisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to send to\nHighgate/Cerberus the proposed transaction documents that reflected such terms in a form that CorePoint would be willing to execute and to request\nconfirmation that Highgate/Cerberus was prepared to enter into definitive agreements on such terms in advance of the Board meeting that was scheduled\nfor the afternoon of the following day. Following the meeting, in the evening of November 4, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated these\ninstructions to representatives of Highgate/Cerberus.\nIn the afternoon of November 5, 2021, CorePoint\u2019s tax counsel conducted a call with the IRS appeals team, during which the IRS submitted a settlement\noffer, subsequently confirmed in writing on the same day, with respect to the IRS Matter, which would provide for total payments by CorePoint of\napproximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment. Pursuant to this settlement offer, CorePoint estimated the total payment\namount under the merger agreement pursuant to the settlement would be less than $160 million, and any additional consideration payable at the closing\nof the merger to CorePoint stockholders would likely be approximately $0.10 per share.\nAlso in the afternoon of November 5, 2021, representatives of Highgate/Cerberus submitted revised transaction documents, which substantially accepted\nall of the terms reflected in the drafts provided by CorePoint on the previous day.\nAlso on November 5, 2021, CorePoint and affiliates of Wyndham entered into a definitive agreement on terms substantially consistent with the non-\nbinding letter of intent that had been made available to bidders prior to the submission of second-round indications of interest, which definitive\nagreement would become effective upon announcement of a change of control transaction of CorePoint.\nIn the evening of November 5, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan, HWE and Simpson Thacher in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of CorePoint\u2019s legal and financial advisors updated the Board with\nrespect to the developments over the past two days and informed the Board that the most recent proposals from Highgate/Cerberus and Party A,\nrespectively, were now on substantially the same terms and that the proposal from Highgate/Cerberus reflected a modestly higher valuation than Party\nA\u2019s proposal. Representatives of CorePoint management reviewed with the Board the settlement offer from the IRS. The Board, upon consultation with its\nadvisors, instructed CorePoint management and its advisors to communicate the IRS settlement proposal to both Party A and Highgate/Cerberus, to\ninform both bidders that the Board was planning to convene on the following day in order to evaluate the parties\u2019 respective proposals, and to request\neach bidder to submit its best and final proposal, finalize all transaction documents and be in a position to sign a definitive agreement promptly following\nthe meeting of the Board on November 6, 2021. Following the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated these instructions to representatives\nof Highgate/Cerberus and Party A, respectively.\nOn November 6, 2021, both bidders submitted their respective best and final proposals. Party A submitted a revised proposal, which reflected a\nmoderately increased valuation. However, the proposal from Highgate/Cerberus remained the highest valuation received at $15.65 per share, after taking\ninto account the adjustment for the IRS Matter and subject to incremental consideration in the event of a settlement of the IRS Matter for less than $160\nmillion (which valuation reflected a $1.23 per share increase from the second round bid submitted by Highgate/Cerberus) and both proposals were\notherwise on substantially the same terms.\nLater on November 6, 2021, the Board held a telephonic meeting with representatives of CorePoint management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, HWE\nand Simpson Thacher in attendance. At the meeting,\n \n45\nTable of Contents\nrepresentatives of CorePoint management updated the Board on the status of the negotiations with Party A and Highgate/Cerberus, including stating\nthat all open issues with respect to the terms of a potential transaction with either of the two parties had been resolved and definitive documentation had\nbeen finalized. The Board discussed with its legal and financial advisors that the merger consideration contemplated by the final proposal from\nHighgate/Cerberus was higher than the consideration contemplated by the final proposal from Party A and that both proposals were otherwise on\nsubstantially the same terms, and that both bidders stood ready in a position to enter into a transaction with CorePoint promptly following the meeting.\nThe Board considered the risks and benefits of the proposed merger as compared to the possible strategic alternatives that the Board had considered\nthroughout the process leading up to the announcement of the proposed merger, as well as CorePoint\u2019s long-term strategic plan as an independent public\ncompany and the risks associated with executing such plan. The counterparty to the merger agreement with Highgate/Cerberus was Cavalier, an entity\ncontrolled by Highgate and Cerberus.\nAt this meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the Board J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial analysis of the potential transaction. Following\nfurther discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan then rendered its oral opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its\nopinion, the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion to the Board. The Board considered the fact that\nthe closing price of CorePoint common stock had increased significantly since CorePoint\u2019s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process and\nthat the indications of interest received from all three parties reflected a discount to the most recent closing price per share of CorePoint common stock,\nbut the Board noted that the per share merger consideration of $15.65 to be paid to the holders of CorePoint common stock in the merger represented a\npremium of approximately 42% to CorePoint\u2019s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the last trading day prior to the CorePoint\u2019s public announcement of its\nstrategic alternatives process. The Board also considered that, aside from their interests as CorePoint stockholders, CorePoint\u2019s directors and executive\nofficers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other CorePoint stockholders generally, as described in\nmore detail in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement.\nRepresentatives of CorePoint management discussed with the Board and representatives of Simpson Thacher the fact that there had been no discussions\nduring the course of the process leading up to the proposed merger between members of CorePoint management and representatives of\nHighgate/Cerberus or Party A or other potential acquirors regarding potential employment or compensation arrangements for members of CorePoint\nmanagement following the consummation of a potential transaction with CorePoint. Representatives of Simpson Thacher then reviewed with the Board\ntheir duties under applicable law and the terms of the merger agreement. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board met in executive session, during\nwhich Mr. Cutaia noted, as previously reported to the Board, that neither of the Blackstone parties had a need to sell its shares in the near-term, that their\nobjective had been and continued to be for CorePoint to pursue whatever strategy the Board believed would maximize CorePoint\u2019s value for all of\nCorePoint\u2019s stockholders, and that each believed that the proposed transaction would, in fact, maximize CorePoint\u2019s value for all of CorePoint\u2019s\nstockholders. Representatives of Simpson Thacher also reviewed with the Board the relationship between Simpson Thacher and Blackstone and its\naffiliates.\nAfter further discussion, the Board unanimously determined at the meeting that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nwere advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, approved and adopted the merger agreement, declared advisable,\napproved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by\nCorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and resolved to recommend that CorePoint stockholders approve the\nmerger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\n \n46\nTable of Contents\nIn the evening of November 6, 2021, CorePoint and Cavalier executed the merger agreement and the Blackstone parties and Cavalier entered into the\nsupport agreement.\nOn November 7, 2021, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest, which reflected a valuation below the merger consideration and below the final\nproposal from Party A.\nOn November 8, 2021, prior to the opening of trading, CorePoint and Highgate/Cerberus issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the\nmerger agreement.",

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nThe Board unanimously recommends that CorePoint stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal.\nAfter consideration of various factors, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nwere advisable and in the best interest of CorePoint and CorePoint stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement, (iii) declared advisable,\napproved and authorized the entry into the merger agreement, the merger, and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, (iv) resolved that the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be submitted for consideration\nby CorePoint common stockholders at a special meeting of CorePoint stockholders and (v) resolved to recommend that CorePoint stockholders approve\nthe merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nWhen you consider the Board\u2019s recommendation, you should be aware that CorePoint\u2019s executive officers and directors may have interests in the merger\nthat may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint stockholders generally. These interests are described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of\nCorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nFactors Considered Supporting Approval of the Merger.\nIn the course of reaching its decision, the Board consulted with members of CorePoint\u2019s senior management and our financial and legal advisors,\nconsidered a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its decision, including the following (not\nnecessarily in order of relative importance):\nThe merger consideration represents a significant premium to CorePoint\u2019s unaffected stock price. The Board considered the current and historical\ntrading prices of our shares of common stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration\nthat may be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) represents a premium of approximately 42% to CorePoint\u2019s closing stock price on July 13, 2021, the\nlast trading day prior to CorePoint\u2019s public announcement of its strategic alternatives process.\nProcess to explore a sale of the company\u037e Market Check. The Board considered the thorough and diligent transaction process that CorePoint undertook,\nwith the assistance of its financial advisors at the Board\u2019s direction, to evaluate its strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of CorePoint. In\nconnection with CorePoint\u2019s publicly announced strategic alternatives process, CorePoint, together with its outside advisors and representatives,\ncontacted or was contacted by approximately 70 potential acquirors of CorePoint and executed 41 confidentiality agreements. Throughout the process,\nthe Board was advised by experienced legal counsel and financial advisors, conducted extensive deliberations and met frequently to review potential\nstrategic alternatives with its advisors. Of the 41 parties that executed confidentiality agreements, 9 parties submitted first-round indications of interests,\n6 parties were invited into the second round of the process, 3 parties submitted second-round indications of interest, and CorePoint negotiated multiple\nprice increases from each of those 3 parties during the final weeks of the process, as more fully described above under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 36. Following several weeks of arms-length negotiations, on November 6,\n \n47Table of Contents\n2021, both Cavalier and Party A submitted proposals which the Board believed, based on the nature of the negotiations, to reflect the maximum price that\neach of the parties was willing to pay and the terms most favorable to CorePoint and its stockholders to which each party was willing to agree, which\nconsisted of definitive, fully negotiated and fully financed proposals in executable form. The merger consideration contemplated by the final proposal\nfrom Cavalier was higher than the consideration contemplated by the final proposal from Party A, and both proposals were otherwise on substantially the\nsame terms. The Board believed that, in light of the strategic alternatives process we engaged in, the responses we received from participants in the\nprocess and the best and final offers received from each of Cavalier and Party A, it was unlikely that any other party would be willing to acquire\nCorePoint at an all-cash price in excess of the merger consideration.\nStrategic alternatives to a sale of the company. The Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing CorePoint\nstockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger (including the potential stockholder value that could be expected to be\ngenerated from remaining an independent public company based on continuing our standalone business plan including the disposition of all of our\nproperties other than the CorePoint Core Portfolio, or based on our growth business plans that also further assume the use of debt capital following these\ndispositions to acquire additional core properties, the possibility to pursue a sale, in a portfolio or company-level transaction or in connection with a\nliquidation of CorePoint, of all of the CorePoint Core Portfolio, the possibility of being acquired by other companies, the possibility of acquisitions or\nmergers with other companies and other transactions, as well as the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives), and the\ntiming and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives. The Board considered these alternatives as compared to the risks and benefits of the proposed\nmerger.\nRisks relating to remaining a standalone company. The Board evaluated CorePoint\u2019s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public\ncompany, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation included the Board\u2019s review of our business, operations,\nassets, operating results, financial condition, prospects, business strategy, competitive position, terms of our existing management agreement, and\nindustry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price of our common stock, to assess the\nprospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company. The Board believed that the certainty provided by the acquisition of\nCorePoint by Cavalier for the per share merger consideration of $15.65 (not counting any contingent consideration that may be payable with respect to\nthe IRS Matter) was more favorable to CorePoint stockholders than the potential risk-weighted value of remaining an independent public company, after\naccounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon our business and financial plans in the short- and long-term.\nSuch risks include:\n \n \n\u2022\n business, financial and operating risks inherent to the lodging industry\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control, including the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the stage of the lodging\nindustry\u2019s current recovery from certain of such effects\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n availability and cost of labor, supplies and other operating expenses affecting our operating margins and profitability\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n uncertainties in the current lodging market and competition from market participants that may have more favorable access to capital, and the\nlimited opportunities to identify, finance and acquire hotel investments at a sufficient risk adjusted rate of return\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the impact of CorePoint\u2019s size on our ability to compete effectively\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n our ability to source capital at a competitive cost of capital\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n our dependence on our third-party hotel managers and franchisors\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n covenants in our hotel management and franchise agreements that limit or restrict the sale of our hotels\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n expected increases in the interest rates in the current capital markets which could increase the cost of debt\u037e\n \n48\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n federal and state income tax impact from dispositions of our hotels, which could reduce capital for reinvestment, future profitability or\noperating cash flow\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n uncertainty over the eventual resolution of the IRS Matter and the potential effects on future operations and availability of capital:\n \n \n\u2022\n our ability to maintain profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n other risks and uncertainties discussed in CorePoint\u2019s public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning\non page 116 of this proxy statement.\nCash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which, compared to non-cash\nconsideration, provides certainty of value with respect to the merger consideration of $15.65 per share (not counting any contingent consideration that\nmay be payable with respect to the IRS Matter) and immediate liquidity to CorePoint stockholders upon the consummation of the merger, in comparison\nto the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining an independent public company or engaging in a transaction in which all or a portion of\nthe consideration is payable in stock. The Board weighed the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of CorePoint common stock by virtue of\nthe merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value for the CorePoint common stock would approach the merger consideration in the\nforeseeable future, as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with our business.\nPotential incremental cash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration of $15.65 per share may be increased by\nincremental cash consideration per share in certain circumstances if CorePoint timely resolves the IRS Matter, based on the amount, if any, by which a\nfinal settlement amount with respect to the IRS Matter (including any penalties and accrued interest with respect thereto) is less than $160 million. The\nBoard considered the fact that CorePoint received a settlement offer from the IRS with respect to the IRS Matter on November 5, 2021, has accepted such\noffer and entered into a definitive agreement with respect thereto, which remains subject to the calculation by the IRS of applicable interest, which would\nprovide for total payments by CorePoint of approximately $89.6 million plus statutory interest through the date of payment, as described in more detail in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Merger Consideration\u2014What Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 34, although there can be\nno assurances that any additional consideration will be received by the holders of CorePoint common stock.\nHigh probability of closing. The Board considered the high probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things, Cerberus\u2019\nproven ability to complete large acquisition transactions, Highgate\u2019s extensive experience in the hotel industry, the fact that Cerberus Credit and the\nHighgate Sponsors have executed equity commitment letters pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, they have severally\ncommitted to provide an aggregate equity contribution of $297,456,742 in cash, in the case of Cerberus Credit, and $360,681,461 in cash, in the case of the\nHighgate Sponsors, for the purpose of funding a portion of the merger consideration pursuant to, and in accordance with, the merger agreement, and the\npayment of related fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the merger, the absence of a financing condition for the merger, and the $58 million\nreverse termination fee, payable to CorePoint if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed by Cerberus\nCredit and the Highgate Sponsors pursuant to limited guaranties provided by each of Cerberus Credit and the Highgate Sponsors.\nFavorable conditions. The Board considered its belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate and lodging markets are generally favorable,\nwith prices for certain real estate assets being at or near historical highs while interest rates are at or near historical lows, and the possibility that interest\nrates may rise in the future, which may result in less favorable conditions for sale transactions in the real estate markets.\nRegulatory approvals. The Board considered the fact that CorePoint and Cavalier have determined that the filing of notification and report forms under\nthe Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) (or other antitrust laws) will not be necessary to complete the merger, and the Board considered Cavalier\u2019s\nobligation under the merger\n \n49\nTable of Contents\nagreement to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable laws and regulations\nin a timely manner as are necessary to eliminate each impediment to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and obtain\nall approvals required under applicable antitrust laws, subject to certain limitations specified in the merger agreement.\nFairness opinion. The Board considered the financial analyses presented by representatives of J.P. Morgan at the Board\u2019s meeting on November 6, 2021,\nas well as the oral opinion delivered by J.P. Morgan to the Board on November 6, 2021, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nwritten opinion to the Board, dated November 7, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the per share merger\nconsideration of $15.65 to be paid to CorePoint\u2019s common stockholders in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nstockholders. The J.P. Morgan opinion is more fully described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014",

        "Section Text": "Interests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nYou should be aware that CorePoint\u2019s executive officers and directors, and in each case including organizations of which such person is an officer or\npartner, have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CorePoint\u2019s stockholders generally. The Board was aware\nof these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement. These interests are described below. For purposes of\nthe discussion below, CorePoint\u2019s executive officers are President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith A. Cline\u037e Executive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer, Daniel E. Swanstrom II\u037e and Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, Mark M. Chloupek (together with Messrs. Cline and\nSwanstrom, the \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d or \u201cNEOs\u201d). CorePoint does not currently have any other executive officers other than the NEOs.\nThese material interests are summarized below:\n \n \n\u2022\n CorePoint\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification\nagreements, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies and the merger agreement.\n \n \n\u2022\n Certain of CorePoint\u2019s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation and benefits under CorePoint\u2019s Executive\nSeverance Plan (as described below).\n \n \n\u2022\n The merger agreement provides for the payment of a pro-rated portion of annual bonuses for fiscal year 2022 (with performance deemed\nachieved at target) for all employees eligible for an annual bonus (including the named executive officers) if closing does not occur by\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n \n \n\u2022\n The merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all CorePoint equity-based awards including Restricted Stock,\nRSUs, PSUs, deferred stock units, and dividend equivalent rights associated with such awards for all employees holding such awards\n(including the named executive officers).\nArrangements with Cavalier\nAny CorePoint executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to Cavalier\nor the surviving entity following the closing of the merger, however, may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in\ncash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Cavalier or the surviving entity. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation\narrangements between such persons and Cavalier and/or its affiliates have been established. Pursuant to the merger agreement, our executive officers will\nserve as officers of the surviving entity immediately following the effective time until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified\nor until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the surviving entity\u2019s certificate of limited partnership and limited partnership\nagreement and applicable law.\nDirectors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, CorePoint\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification, expense\nadvancement and insurance arrangements. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2013 Indemnification of Directors and Officers\u037e Insurance\u201d\nbeginning on page 91 for a description of such ongoing arrangements.\nExecutive Severance Plan\nWe maintain an Executive Severance Plan in which employees of CorePoint at the level of Vice President and above (including our NEOs) participate. The\nExecutive Severance Plan provides for payment of severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment by CorePoint without \u201ccause\u201d or by\nthe employee for \u201cgood\n \n61Table of Contents\nreason\u201d (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) (a \u201ccovered termination\u201d), and enhanced severance benefits in the event of a covered\ntermination that occurs on or within the six-month period prior to, or within the two-year period following the first to occur of (i) a change in control (as\ndefined in the Executive Severance Plan, and which includes the merger) and (ii) a significant corporate event (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan\nand which generally means a transaction that results in the elimination from the Company and its subsidiaries of all, or a majority of, the CorePoint\u2019s\noperating units or real property assets) (as applicable, the \u201cCIC protected period\u201d).\nIn the event a covered termination occurs within the CIC protected period, in addition to certain accrued obligations, participants are entitled to:\n \n \n\u2022\n a pro-rata bonus for the year of termination, based on target performance, payable at the time cash bonus payments are paid to other\nsimilarly-situated employees\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n 3.0 times (for Mr. Cline) and 2.0 times (for Messrs. Swanstrom and Chloupek) the sum of the executive\u2019s base salary and target annual\nbonus, payable in a lump sum within 60 days following the date of the executive\u2019s termination of employment\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n continued health insurance coverage at substantially the same level as provided immediately prior to such termination, at CorePoint\u2019s\nexpense, at the same cost as generally provided to similarly situated active Company employees for a period up 36 months for Mr. Cline and\n24 months for Messrs. Swanstrom and Chloupek\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n payment of, or reimbursement for, up to $10,000 in outplacement services within the three-year period following the executive\u2019s termination\nof employment.\nSeverance benefits payable under the Executive Severance Plan are subject to the executive\u2019s (i) execution and non-revocation of a general release of\nclaims in the favor of CorePoint and (ii) continued compliance with the executive\u2019s Non-Interference Agreement. Each NEO\u2019s Non-Interference Agreement\nincludes the following restrictive covenants: non-competition covenant that applies during the employment term and for 12 months thereafter, employee\nand consultant non-solicitation, employee no-hire, and business relation non-solicitation covenants that apply during the employment term and for 24\nmonths thereafter. The Non-Interference Agreements also include a perpetual confidentiality and assignment of IP covenant, and a non-disparagement\ncovenant that applies during the employment term and for 24 months thereafter.\nIn addition to severance benefits, the Executive Severance Plan also provides that, upon the first to occur of (i) a change in control and (ii) a significant\ncorporate event, any unvested outstanding equity award granted to the participants under our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \u201cCompany Stock Plan\u201d)\nthat is not continued, converted, assumed or replaced in connection with such change in control or significant corporate event will fully vest\u037e provided,\nthat, vesting for performance-based vesting awards with market performance conditions will be based on actual performance and financial performance\nconditions will be based on target performance. However, as described below, pursuant to the merger agreement, performance-based awards will vest in\nconnection with the merger based on the greater of target or actual performance.\nThe Executive Severance Plan also provides that if any payments and/or benefits due to a participant (including any NEO) under the Executive Severance\nPlan and/or any other arrangements will constitute \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d (as defined in Section 280G (\u201cSection 280G\u201d) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d)), CorePoint will reduce the amount of payments under the Executive Severance Plan by the minimum amount\nnecessary to avoid triggering the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the \u201c280G Excise Tax\u201d), but only if the net after-tax amount of such\npayments and benefits as so reduced is greater than or equal to the net after-tax amount of such payments and benefits without such reduction.\nMr. Chloupek and CorePoint are also party to an employment agreement, which includes severance benefits. The Executive Severance Plan provides that\nin the event any amount due and payable under the Executive\n \n62\nTable of Contents\nSeverance Plan is greater than and in addition to the amount due and payable under such other agreement, the participant will be entitled to such greater\namount. The enhanced change in control severance benefits payable to Mr. Chloupek under the Executive Severance Plan are generally greater than the\nseverance benefits provided under Mr. Chloupek\u2019s employment agreement (as summarized below), and, accordingly, in the event Mr. Chloupek\u2019s\nemployment is terminated in connection with the merger, Mr. Chloupek would be entitled to the severance benefits provided under the Executive\nSeverance Plan.\nMr. Chloupek\u2019s employment agreement also provides for reimbursement by us on a \u201cgrossed up\u201d basis for all taxes incurred in connection with all\npayments or benefits provided to him upon a change in control that are determined by us to be subject to the 280G Excise Tax in an amount equal to the\nlesser of (A) the aggregate amount of all excise tax payments on a \u201cgrossed up\u201d basis, or (B) 1.25 times his then-current annual base salary.\n2022 Annual Bonuses\nThe merger agreement provides that if closing has not occurred by January 1, 2022, then on or as soon as practicable following the closing date, a pro-\nrated portion of the bonuses or short term incentives that relate to performance during CorePoint\u2019s 2022 fiscal year will be paid to employees eligible to\nreceive such bonuses or incentives pursuant to terms of CorePoint\u2019s 2022 annual bonus plans or short term incentive plans. The amount of each pro-\nrated bonus will be based on the number of days that occur during the 2022 fiscal year prior to the closing (with performance goals or metrics deemed\nachieved at target).\nTreatment of Company Equity Awards\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, all CorePoint equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (including those held by our\nexecutive officers) will generally be subject to the following treatment:\n \n \n\u2022\n Immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding share of common stock of CorePoint subject to vesting restrictions (\u201cRestricted\nStock\u201d), restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) (other than a performance-based restricted stock unit (\u201cPSU\u201d)) or deferred stock unit granted under\nthe Company Stock Plan (each, a \u201cStock Unit\u201d) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become\nimmediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Unit will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the\neffective time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such Stock Unit immediately\nprior to the effective time multiplied by (y) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalents\nprovided under the terms of any applicable Stock Unit award agreement (\u201cdividend equivalent rights\u201d), less applicable taxes required to be\nwithheld with respect to such payment.\n \n \n\u2022\n Immediately prior to the effective time, each PSU will automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof,\nbecome immediately vested and be cancelled and the holder of each such PSU will be entitled to receive (without interest), at or promptly\nafter the effective time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of CorePoint common stock subject to such PSU immediately\nprior to the effective time, calculated based on the greater of (A) actual performance achieved through the effective time in accordance with\nthe terms of such PSU, and (B) target level performance, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, together with any applicable\nunpaid dividend equivalent rights provided under the terms of any applicable PSU award agreement, less applicable taxes required to be\nwithheld with respect to such payment.\nQuantification of Company Equity Award\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be realized by each of our named executive officers with respect to their CorePoint equity awards that are\nexpected to vest in connection with the merger see \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d section below. In addition, the estimated aggregate amount that\nwould be realized by CorePoint\u2019s\n \n63\nTable of Contents\nnon-employee directors in settlement of their RSUs and deferred stock units in accordance with the merger agreement is $6,601,827.30 (calculated based\non RSUs and deferred stock units outstanding as of January 13, 2022, and assuming the effective time occurs on March 3, 2022). These amounts assume\nthat any time-vesting equity awards that are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to March 3, 2022 vest, but do not attempt to forecast\nany additional equity grants, issuances or forfeitures that may occur prior to the closing of the merger and do not include any additional dividend rights\nor dividend equivalent rights that may accrue prior to the closing of the merger. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not be\naccurate on the relevant date, the actual amounts, if any, to be realized by CorePoint\u2019s executive officers who are not named executive officers and non-\nemployee directors may materially differ from the amounts set forth above.\n280G Mitigation Actions\nCorePoint may take certain actions before the closing to mitigate the amount of potential \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d for \u201cdisqualified individuals\u201d\n(each as defined in Section 280G) (the \u201c280G Mitigation Actions\u201d). As of the date of this proxy statement, the following 280G Mitigation Actions have\nbeen taken, as further described below: (i) the acceleration of certain PSUs held by Keith Cline, Mark Chloupek, Howard Garfield, and Dan Swanstrom\n(collectively, the \u201cCovered Executives\u201d), and (ii) the acceleration of payment of 2021 annual bonuses for the Covered Executives.\nMore specifically, the PSUs which were granted to each of the Covered Executives on March 25, 2020 (the \u201c2020 PSUs\u201d) were accelerated and settled on\nDecember 17, 2021 (together with any applicable unpaid dividend equivalent amounts), with vesting determined based on maximum performance. The\nnumber of 2020 PSUs accelerated and settled (at maximum performance) for each of the Covered Executives was as follows: 824,610 for Keith Cline,\n247,384 for Mark Chloupek, 92,357 for Howard Garfield, and 247,384 for Dan Swanstrom. The shares received by each of the Covered Executives in\nconnection with the acceleration and settlement of the 2020 PSUs (net of shares withheld for tax withholding purposes) are reflected in the table set forth\nin the \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management\u201d section below. Payment of annual bonuses under the CorePoint Operating\nPartnership L.P. Section 16 Short Term Incentive Plan for the performance period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Bonuses\u201d) for\neach of the Covered Executives was also accelerated. Such bonuses were paid on December 23, 2021 in connection with the 280G Mitigation Actions, and\nwere otherwise expected to be paid in the ordinary course on or around January 31, 2022. The amount of the 2021 Bonuses paid to each of the Covered\nExecutives was as follows: $1,591,350 for Keith Cline, $824,000 for Mark Chloupek, $336,000 for Howard Garfield, and $950,000 for Dan Swanstrom. Each\nCovered Executive executed a repayment agreement that requires the executive to repay the accelerated compensation amounts if the executive\nvoluntarily resigns prior to the earlier of the closing of the merger and the originally scheduled vesting, payment or settlement date (as applicable).\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates\nto, the merger that will or may become payable to each named executive officer of CorePoint in connection with the merger. For additional details\nregarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption \u201cInterests of CorePoint\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d above.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on several assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the effective\ndate of the merger, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may\noccur prior to completion of the merger. The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to\nreceive or were vested in as of January 13, 2022. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity or cash award grants,\nissuances or forfeitures that may occur, or future dividend\n \n64\nTable of Contents\nequivalents that may be accrued, prior to the closing of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the per share value of CorePoint common\nstock was based on the per share merger consideration ($15.65 per share) and the following assumptions were used:\n \n \n\u2022\n the effective date of the merger is March 3, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the\ndisclosure in this section\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any time-vesting equity awards that are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to March 3, 2022 will vest\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the employment of each named executive officer will have been terminated by Cavalier or an affiliate without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for\n\u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the Executive Severance Plan or, in the case of Mr. Chloupek, as defined in his employment\nagreement) (a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d) immediately following the assumed date of closing specified above\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n each named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate and annual target bonus remains unchanged from those in place as of January 13, 2022\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n each named executive officer holds only those equity awards that were outstanding and unvested on January 13, 2022 and PSUs will vest at\nmaximum level of performance (i.e., 175% of target performance).\nAs a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described\nin the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nFor purposes of this discussion, \u201csingle-trigger\u201d refers to benefits that arise solely as a result of the closing, and \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d refers to benefits that\narise as a result of the closing accompanied by a qualifying termination immediately following the closing.\n \nName\n \nCash (1)\n($)\n  \nEquity (2)\n($)\n  \nPerquisites/\nBenefits (3)\n($)\n  \nTax\nReimbursement\n(4) ($)\n  \nTotal\n($) (5)\n \nKeith A.

Chloupek and Swanstrom) the sum of the executive\u2019s annual base salary and target annual bonus ($4,774,050 for Mr. Cline, $1,900,000 for\nMr. Swanstrom, and $1,648,000 for Mr. Chloupek), and (ii) a prorated portion of the executive\u2019s target annual bonus ($198,919 for Mr. Cline, $118,750\nfor Mr. Swanstrom, and $103,000 for Mr. Chloupek) (the \u201cPro-Rated Severance Bonus\u201d). The cash severance payments and benefits included in this\ncolumn are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payments. However, as described in \u201c2022 Annual Bonuses\u201d section above, pursuant to the merger agreement, if\nclosing has not occurred by January 1, 2022, a pro-rated portion of the executive\u2019s annual bonus with respect to performance during the 2022 fiscal\nyear (\u201cPro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus\u201d) will be paid at or shortly following the closing, based on the number of days that occurs during the 2022\nfiscal year prior to the closing (with performance goals or metrics deemed achieved at target). Such payment constitutes a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payment.\nAssuming a closing date of March 3, 2022, the amount of the Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus is $132,976 for Keith Cline, $79,384 for Dan Swanstrom,\nand $68,855 for Mark Chloupek. To the extent an executive receives a Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus, the Pro-Rated Severance Bonus Amount\npayable upon a subsequent qualifying termination under the Executive Severance Plan would be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid\nduplication of payment. Accordingly, we did not include the amount of the Pro-Rated 2022 Annual Bonus in addition to the Pro-Rated Severance\nBonus amount for purposes of calculating the total amount included in the \u201cCash\u201d column for each executive, as this would result in double\ncounting.\n \n65\nTable of Contents\n(2)\nEquity.

The amount payable to each named executive officer is a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payment, which means the amount will become payable\nonly upon a qualifying termination of employment following the effective time.\n(4)\nTax Reimbursement. Certain payments, awards, benefits or distributions made to Mr. Chloupek in connection with the merger could potentially be\nsubject to the excise tax imposed on \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d (as defined for purposes of 280G) by the Code (\u201cSection 280G Excise Taxes\u201d).\nMr. Chloupek\u2019s employment agreement provides that Mr. Chloupek is entitled to a one-time reimbursement for all such 280G Excise Taxes (or, if less,\n1.25 times his then-current annual base salary). This reimbursement amount would constitute a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payment. However, based on a\nSection 280G analysis prepared by the Company\u2019s advisors (which takes into account the effect of the 280G Mitigation Actions taken (as described\nabove)), it is not anticipated that Mr. Chloupek will receive \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d in connection with the merger, and accordingly Mr.\nChloupek will not be subject to an excise tax on any such amounts. Accordingly, we included $0 for the estimated value of Mr. Chloupek\u2019s\nreimbursement for Section 280G Excise Taxes.",

The Parties\nacknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,\nspecific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and\nprovisions hereof,\n \nA-65\nTable of Contents\nwithout proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the posting of security, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are\nentitled at law or in equity. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable\nfor any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach. The Parties hereby further\nacknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and\nprovisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including Section 6.4 [Further Action\u037e Efforts] and Section\n6.11 [Parent Financing]) by Parent and, subject to the next sentence, to cause Parent to consummate the Transactions (for the avoidance of doubt,\nincluding to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 [Closing]) on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement.

Each of the\nParties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x)\neither Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any\nParty seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement\nshall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
