This will be\ntreated as ordinary compensation income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and subject to income and other payroll tax withholding.\nCompany RSUs and Company PSUs that are forfeited prior to closing (pursuant to termination of employment or otherwise) will not be\nentitled to any consideration at the close of the Merger.\nIf you previously received Tenneco class A common stock in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs and already recognized\nordinary income on such Tenneco class A common stock at the time of such settlement, then you will generally recognize a capital gain or\nloss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the income you previously recognized and the amount paid for the\nstock in the Merger. The capital gain or loss will be long-term if more than one year has expired between the time you recognized the income\nand the Merger. Holders of such Tenneco class A common stock received in settlement of Company RSUs or Company PSUs generally will\nnot be subject to income or other payroll tax withholding on any such capital gain.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Tenneco and its common stock?\nTenneco\u2019s class A common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cTEN\u201d.

As a private company following the completion\nof the Merger, the registration of Tenneco\u2019s class A common stock and Tenneco\u2019s obligation to file reports and make other public disclosures\nto the SEC under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Tenneco\u2019s class A common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE. Tenneco\nstockholders will cease to have any equity interest in Tenneco and will have no right to participate in its earnings and future growth.\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to the named executive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger?\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act requires Tenneco to conduct a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain \u201cgolden parachute\u201d\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to Tenneco\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the\nagreements and understandings with Tenneco pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable.\nTenneco Inc.\n19\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the annual\nmeeting?\nApproval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.

Further, the underlying compensation plans and\nagreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nHow does Tenneco\u2019s Board of Directors recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nAfter consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and after reviewing and considering the terms and conditions of the\nMerger and the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Tenneco and its\nstockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption, and (iv) recommended that the\nTenneco stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nAccordingly, Tenneco\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger (Item 1)\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named\nexecutive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger (Item 2)\u037e and\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and approve the Merger if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (Item\n3).\nTo review the Board\u2019s reasons for recommending the Merger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of Our Board of\nDirectors and Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on page 41 of this proxy statement.\nIn addition, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote:\n\u2022\nFOR the election of all nominees for election as director described in this proxy statement (Item 4)\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for 2022 (Item 5)\u037e and\n\u2022\nFOR the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of our executive compensation (Item 6).\nDo any of Tenneco\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be\nin addition to my interests as a stockholder?\nYes.

Your bank, broker or other\nnominee may not be permitted to exercise voting discretion as to some of the matters to be acted upon. Therefore, please give voting\ninstructions to your bank, broker or other nominee.\nUnless you hold your shares through the Company\u2019s 401(k) plans, you may vote via the internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m. Eastern\nTime, on June 6, 2022, or the Company\u2019s agent must receive your paper proxy card on or before June 6, 2022. If you hold your shares through\nthe Company\u2019s 401(k) plans, you may vote via the internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on June 2, 2022, or the Company\u2019s\nagent must receive your paper proxy card on or before June 2, 2022.\nHow will my proxy be voted?\nAll properly completed, unrevoked proxies that are timely received will be voted in accordance with the specifications made.\nIf a properly executed, unrevoked written proxy card does not specifically direct the voting of shares covered, the proxy will be voted:\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named\nexecutive officers of Tenneco in connection with the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the proposal to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and approve the Merger if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the election of all nominees for election as director as described in this proxy statement\u037e\n\u2022\nFOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\nFOR the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of our executive compensation.\nIf any other business properly comes before the meeting, or any adjournment thereof, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in\naccordance with the recommendations of Tenneco\u2019s Board of Directors.\nMay I revoke or change my vote?\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is actually voted by giving written notice of revocation to\nour Corporate Secretary, by delivering a proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or by internet) or by attending virtually and voting\nduring the Annual Meeting. Virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you\nspecifically make that request. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your bank,\nbroker or other record holder or, by attending virtually and voting during the Annual Meeting.\nWill my vote be made public?\nAll proxies, ballots and voting materials that identify the votes of specific stockholders will generally be kept confidential, except as necessary\nto meet applicable legal requirements and to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWhat constitutes a quorum, permitting the Annual Meeting to conduct its business?\nThe presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of class A common\nstock as of the record date is considered a quorum for the transaction of business. If you submit a properly completed proxy or if you virtually\nattend the Annual Meeting to vote during the meeting, your shares of class A common stock will be considered part of the quorum.\nAbstentions and \u201cbroker non-votes\u201d are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker non-vote\noccurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder\ndoes not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.\nThe Merger Proposal (Item 1), Merger Compensation Proposal (Item 2), Adjournment Proposal (Item 3), election of directors (Item 4), and the\nadvisory vote on executive compensation (Item 6) are \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d items, while ratifying the appointment of our independent public\naccountants (Item 5) is a discretionary item. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to any of these\nitems, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote with respect to the applicable proposal and those votes will be counted as \u201cbroker\nnon-votes.\u201d\nHow many votes are needed to approve a proposal?\nAssuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote by holders of at least a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares that\nare outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required for the adoption of the Merger Proposal (Item 1). Because the vote standard for the\napproval of this proposal is a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares that are outstanding and entitled to vote thereon,\nabstentions and broker non-votes have the effect of a vote against the proposal.\nAssuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares present, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting and\nentitled to vote is required to: (i) ratify the Merger Compensation Proposal (Item 2), (ii) ratify the Adjournment Proposal (Item 3), (iii) ratify the\nappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent public accountants for 2021 (Item 5) and (iv) to approve, by a non-binding\nadvisory vote, our executive compensation (Item 6). Because the vote standard for the approval of these proposals is a majority of shares\npresent and entitled to vote, abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposals and broker non-votes have no effect on the proposals.\nAssuming the presence of a quorum, each director nominee receiving a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting (in person or by\nproxy) will be elected as a director (Item 4). A \u201cmajority of the votes cast\u201d means the number of \u201cFor\u201d votes cast exceeds the number of\n\u201cAgainst\u201d votes cast. A proxy marked \u201cAbstain\u201d with respect to any director will not be counted in determining the total number of votes cast.\nBecause the election of directors is determined on the basis of a majority of the votes cast, abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect\non the election of directors.\nShould I send in my Tenneco stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent to be engaged by Parent in connection with the Merger will send to each of Tenneco\u2019s\nstockholders written, detailed instructions for exchanging your stock certificates for the Merger Consideration. You must return your stock\ncertificates as described in the instructions. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive\ninstructions from the broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the exchange of your \u201cstreet name\u201d\nshares for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in any certificates now.\nWhat happens to my vote if I sell my shares before the Annual Meeting?\nThe Record Date is earlier than both the date of the annual meeting and the consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your Shares after the\nRecord Date but before the annual meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you transfer your Shares and each of you notifies\nTenneco Inc.\n23\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nTenneco in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such Shares at the annual meeting but will transfer the right\nto receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your Shares.\nWho will count the vote?\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of election.\nHow can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?\nWe will report the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the end of the Annual Meeting.\nHow is the solicitation being made?\nThe cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by us. Solicitation will be made by mail, and may be made by directors, officers and\nemployees, personally or by telephone, email or fax. Proxy cards and materials also will be distributed to beneficial owners of stock through\nbrokers, custodians, nominees and other like parties, and we expect to reimburse such parties for their charges and expenses. We have\nengaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist us in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $50,000 plus expense reimbursement.\nDoes Tenneco allow stockholders to have proxy access for the nomination of directors?\nYes. The Board has adopted proxy access By-Law provisions to permit eligible stockholders to include nominees in the Company\u2019s proxy\nstatement and form of proxy. See \u201cSubmission of Stockholder Proposals\u201d on page 159 of this proxy statement for further information.\nWhere can I find more information about Tenneco?\nWe file reports and other information with the SEC.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nIn the ordinary course, our Board and management team regularly review and assess our results of operations, financial position, business\nstrategy and growth opportunities, as well as the trends and conditions affecting our industries and business generally. Such assessments\ninclude periodic meetings or consultations with third-party advisors, as well as consideration of potential strategic and financial alternatives to\nmaximize stockholder value, including potential business combinations, acquisitions and financing transactions, as well as potential spin-off,\nsale or other extraordinary transactions involving one or more of our business units. In connection with these activities, from time to time, Mr.\nBrian Kesseler, Chief Executive Officer of Tenneco, together with other members of our management team, have held meetings with industry\nparticipants, strategic parties and financial sponsors regarding Tenneco and its business, strategy and financial position. Mr. Kesseler\nregularly updates the Board with respect to these meetings, including as part of the Board\u2019s regularly scheduled discussions of Tenneco\u2019s\nbusiness strategy and potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value.\nIn April 2018, Tenneco announced the acquisition of Federal-Mogul LLC (\u201cFederal-Mogul\u201d), a supplier to original equipment manufacturers and\nthe aftermarket, for a total of $5.4 billion (the \u201cFederal-Mogul Transaction\u201d). Tenneco indicated its intention to create two separate companies,\nan aftermarket and ride performance company that combined the Tenneco Ride Performance business with the Federal-Mogul Motorparts\nbusiness (we refer to these combined businesses as \u201cDRiV\u201d) and a powertrain technology company that combined the Tenneco Clean Air\nbusiness and the Federal-Mogul Powertrain business, including at the time Federal-Mogul\u2019s Systems Protection business (we refer to these\ncombined businesses as \u201cPowertrain Technology\u201d). These companies were proposed to be separated into two publicly traded companies\nthrough a tax-free spin-off of DRiV to Tenneco\u2019s stockholders. The Federal-Mogul Transaction closed in October 2018 and, at the time,\nTenneco indicated that it expected the separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology to occur in late 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018 and continuing into the first quarter of 2019, the market environment weakened in the auto sector, amplified by an\nincreasingly challenging trade relationship between the United States and China, and Tenneco began to feel constrained by its debt levels and\nresulting leverage ratios. In connection with the announcement of its first quarter results of operations, in May 2019, Tenneco indicated that it\nhad revised its timing target for the separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology, and expected the DRiV spin-off to occur in mid-2020.\nDuring the summer and into the fall of 2019, Tenneco continued its work on the administrative separation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology,\nwith the goal of having the businesses ready to operate independently by the end of 2019, but continued to face weakness in the auto\nsector\u2019s market environment, evidenced by, among other things, lower global light vehicle production volumes and signs of softening in the\ncommercial truck market and the challenges of its debt levels and resulting leverage ratios. Recognizing these trends as challenges to the\nseparation of DRiV and Powertrain Technology, the Board initiated a process to evaluate potential strategic options for Tenneco, including\noptions to deleverage and facilitate the separation, as well as the potential sale of the Powertrain Technology business. Tenneco worked with\nits financial and legal advisors, on a confidential basis, to solicit potential interest in the purchase of the Powertrain Technology business,\nincluding outreach to 13 potentially interested parties, including one strategic party and 12 financial sponsors.\nIn connection with the announcement of its third quarter results of operations, in October 2019, Tenneco provided an update on its efforts to\nseparate DRiV and Powertrain Technology, announcing that Tenneco was evaluating potential strategic options to deleverage and facilitate the\nseparation, and noting that then-current trends, if they were to continue, would likely affect Tenneco\u2019s ability to complete a separation in the\nmid-year 2020 time range.\nTenneco Inc.\n29\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\nIn October 2019, Tenneco received non-binding proposals to acquire Powertrain Technology from two financial sponsors. Apollo proposed a\ntransaction with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology in the range of $4.5 to $5.0 billion, and another financial sponsor\nproposed a transaction with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology of $3.5 billion. The enterprise values proposed were made\nbefore giving effect to adjustments for outstanding debt, pension and other liabilities of Powertrain Technology. Although the Board believed\nboth proposals undervalued Powertrain Technology at the time, Tenneco determined to move forward with customary due diligence with Apollo\nto explore whether Apollo would increase its purchase price. Apollo ultimately advised Tenneco that it was only willing to proceed on the basis\nof a proposal with an implied enterprise value for Powertrain Technology of $4.3 billion, and Tenneco concluded that it was not in the best\ninterests of Tenneco stockholders to pursue that transaction and terminated such discussions in December 2019.\nOn January 20, 2020, the Board held a special meeting, attended by Tenneco management, representatives of Lazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC\n(\u201cLazard\u201d) and Tenneco\u2019s legal counsel. After Lazard and Tenneco\u2019s legal counsel left the meeting, the Board discussed, among other things,\nthe on-going efforts to explore the separation of DRiV, either by way of a tax-free spin-off or a sale transaction, as well as other potential\nstrategic and financial alternatives available to Tenneco. The Board determined to publicly reconfirm its ongoing strategic alternatives review\nprocess and to engage Lazard as a financial advisor to assist in its review.\nOn January 27, 2020, Tenneco issued a press release reconfirming its ongoing review of potential strategic alternatives to maximize\nstockholder value, including the engagement of Lazard as a financial advisor to the Board. Tenneco indicated that it was reviewing and\nconsidering, in addition to its plan to spin-off DRiV, a full range of potential strategic options including the sale of DRiV and/or the sale of\nPowertrain Technology. Tenneco also announced that it had made significant progress to facilitate the planned spin-off of DRiV and had\nsubstantially completed the necessary system and process components required for Powertrain Technology and DRiV to operate\nindependently.\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing throughout 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021, the Board met numerous times with its financial\nand legal advisors to review Tenneco\u2019s business, strategy, financial position and operations, in light of the developing COVID-19 pandemic, as\nwell as the potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including the previously planned spin-off of DRiV (and the potential for a rights\noffering to provide additional financing concurrently with the spin-off), a potential sale of Powertrain Technology and a potential exchange offer\nfor Powertrain Technology. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges of its high debt levels and resulting leverage\nratios, impacted the ability of Tenneco to execute any of these alternatives. The Board and its advisors also explored and had discussions\nwith various potential buyers regarding a potential sale or other transaction involving certain other business units, including Systems\nProtection and Motorparts. While Tenneco received an unsolicited non-binding offer from a special purpose acquisition company, or \u201cSPAC\u201d,\nto acquire Motorparts, none of the other third-party discussions resulted in a proposal for the acquisition of or other business combination with\nthe entire company, or the acquisition of or other business combination with any of Tenneco\u2019s other business units (either alone or in\ncombination). Tenneco and the Board evaluated the potential de-SPAC transaction involving Motorparts and determined that none of the\npotential de-SPAC transaction, the potential sale of the Systems Protections business or the other potential business unit sale transactions\n(including a sale of the Systems Protection business) would meaningfully reduce Tenneco\u2019s relative debt levels and resulting leverage ratios,\nor otherwise meaningfully increase equity value relative to Tenneco\u2019s standalone business strategy. Throughout this period, representatives of\nApollo maintained periodic contact with Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Masanovich, the Company\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer, expressing Apollo\u2019s continued interest in Tenneco and Powertrain and Clean Air.\nOn March 2, 2021, representatives from Apollo contacted Tenneco to express Apollo\u2019s continued interest in exploring a potential acquisition of\nPowertrain and Clean Air.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco\u2019s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco management and\nrepresentatives of Lazard. The Lazard representatives reviewed Tenneco\u2019s business segments and financial position, as well as Tenneco\u2019s\nstandalone business strategy, current market valuation and related financial considerations for Tenneco, noting that Tenneco\u2019s stock price\ntraded below its peers and illustrative\n30\nTable of Contents\n\u201csum of the parts\u201d analysis due to, among other things, Tenneco\u2019s high leverage and exposure to internal combustion engine businesses. The\nLazard representatives also discussed potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including the potential sale of Powertrain and\nClean Air. It was noted that the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air could be a viable strategy to reduce Tenneco\u2019s debt levels and\nresulting leverage ratios and eliminate Tenneco\u2019s exposure to internal combustion engine businesses. After discussion, the Board authorized\nmanagement to work with Lazard to prepare for the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air and outreach to Apollo, given its expressions of\ncontinued interest in Powertrain and Clean Air.\nThroughout June, July and August of 2021, Tenneco\u2019s management worked to develop a standalone business plan and financial estimates for\nPowertrain and Clean Air in preparation for an anticipated sale process to commence in early September 2021.\nOn August 10 and 11, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco\u2019s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco\nmanagement and representatives from Lazard. During the meeting, Mr. Kesseler reviewed Tenneco\u2019s business and financial position, including\nan update to Tenneco\u2019s share price performance, cash flows, debt position and resulting leverage. Representatives from Lazard discussed a\nrange of potential strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including potential alternatives for Powertrain and Clean Air and the financial\naspects of a potential sale transaction involving Powertrain and Clean Air. The representatives from Lazard then discussed the historical\noutreaches from Apollo and Apollo\u2019s strategic interest in internal combustion engine assets, Apollo\u2019s continued expressions of interest in\nPowertrain and Clean Air, and an overview of the proposed process to solicit an indication of interest from Apollo. After discussion, the Board\ninstructed management and Lazard to initiate discussions with Apollo with respect to a potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air, including\nby providing confidential business and financial information to Apollo pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement.\nOn August 17, 2021, Apollo entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Tenneco with respect to confidential information furnished\nto Apollo in connection with the potential negotiated acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air. The confidentiality agreement included an 18-\nmonth standstill provision but permitted confidential proposals to be made to the Board at any time and provided for termination of the\nstandstill upon the public announcement of any proposal to acquire more than 50% of Tenneco\u2019s class A common stock.\nOn September 10, 2021, customary marketing materials with respect to Powertrain and Clean Air were furnished to Apollo, including a\nbusiness overview and standalone financial estimates for the Powertrain and Clean Air business units.\nOn September 14, 2021, representatives from Apollo sent a business due diligence request list to Tenneco, requesting customary business\nand financial data to allow Apollo to develop a preliminary proposal. Representatives from Lazard met via videoconference with representatives\nof Apollo to discuss the request list on September 15, 2021, and Apollo subsequently sent an updated business due diligence request list to\nreflect the parties\u2019 conversation. Tenneco management worked with representatives of Lazard from September 15, 2021 through September\n28, 2021 to produce relevant documentation in response to the Apollo business due diligence request.\nOn September 28, 2021, Tenneco\u2019s management and representatives of Lazard held an in-person meeting with representatives from Apollo in\nLazard\u2019s offices in New York City to review the business, strategy, financial position and operations of Powertrain and Clean Air.\nOn October 3, 4 and 13, 2021, in response to additional due diligence requests submitted by Apollo, Tenneco provided additional business\nand financial data to Apollo regarding Powertrain and Clean Air.\nOn October 13, 2021, representatives from Apollo submitted a preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire Powertrain and Clean Air for an\nadjusted total enterprise value (which Apollo indicated represented enterprise value plus pension liabilities, factored receivables and minority\ninterests) of between $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion. Apollo\u2019s proposal was not subject to a financing contingency. Apollo indicated it would\nrequire an exclusivity period of 60 days, commencing\nTenneco Inc.\n31\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nwhen Apollo received responses to its due diligence requests. Apollo also requested that Tenneco reimburse Apollo\u2019s expenses, up to $3\nmillion, if the parties did not mutually agree to the proposed transaction by the termination of the exclusivity period.\nOn October 19, 2021, the Board held a special meeting, attended by Tenneco management, representatives from Lazard and representatives\nfrom Tenneco\u2019s outside legal counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to herein as \u201cLatham\u201d), to discuss the potential sale of Powertrain and\nClean Air, including the indication of interest and request for exclusivity and expense reimbursement from Apollo. Mr. Thomas J. Sabatino,\nTenneco\u2019s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the Board\u2019s fiduciary\nduties, both generally and in the context of the potential Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction. Representatives from Lazard reviewed the\nfinancial aspects of Apollo\u2019s proposal, a preliminary pro forma financial analysis of the proposed transaction, an overview of a preliminary\nprocess timeline, a review of the prior 2019 process with Apollo with respect to the potential sale of Powertrain Technology, and an update on\nautomotive electrification trends and their implications for the industry. The Board also discussed Apollo\u2019s request for exclusivity and expense\nreimbursement in order to proceed with diligence and discussions regarding the proposed transaction. Representatives of Lazard reviewed\nprior marketing efforts for these businesses and, following discussion with management and taking into account advice from representatives of\nLazard, the Board believed it was unlikely that another strategic or private equity bidder would be willing to offer a purchase price in excess of\nthe current Apollo proposal and that, absent a sale of both businesses to the Apollo Funds, a sale of the two businesses separately likely\ncould only be completed in 2022 (or later). It was also noted that other similarly situated companies had publicly announced, or otherwise\ncommunicated, intentions to divest similar businesses exposed to the internal combustion engine industry, which could cause additional\ndownward pressure on price in the future. After discussion, the Board determined to continue discussions with Apollo. In addition, the Board\nestablished a committee comprised of Messrs. Kesseler, Thomas C. Freyman, Dennis J. Letham, Aleksandra A. Miziolek, Charles K.\nStevens, III and John S. Stroup (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) for administrative efficiency purposes, with authority to administer, oversee and\nact as a resource to management and the advisors with respect to the discussions with Apollo, and also to negotiate and approve the\nexclusivity and expense reimbursement letter with Apollo. It was noted that the full Board retained authority with respect to approval of any\nproposed sale transaction.\nFollowing the October 19, 2021 Board meeting, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Lazard and Apollo held numerous discussions\nregarding the Apollo proposal and the duration and terms of exclusivity and expense reimbursement proposed by Apollo. Apollo proposed\nexclusivity through December 31, 2021 and proposed that expense reimbursement would represent 50% of Apollo\u2019s expenses, subject to a\ncap on amounts reimbursed to Apollo of $3 million. After discussion with Tenneco management, at the direction of Tenneco management,\nrepresentatives of Lazard indicated that Tenneco was willing to move forward with a period of exclusivity until December 15, 2021, subject to\napproval of the Transaction Committee.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Transaction Committee authorized Tenneco to enter into exclusivity with Apollo until December 15, 2021, as well as\nexpense reimbursement of 50% of Apollo\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, subject to a cap on amounts reimbursed to Apollo of $3 million.\nAlso on October 25, 2021, representatives of Apollo sent a supplemental due diligence request list that addressed, among other things,\ndiligence topics and questions related to financial matters, commercial matters, customers and suppliers, facilities and operations,\nseparation and carve-out matters, debt and debt-like items and other tax and legal due diligence matters.\nOn October 26, 2021, Apollo and Tenneco entered into the exclusivity and expense reimbursement letter reflecting the terms approved by the\nTransaction Committee.\nOn November 3 and 4, 2021, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco\u2019s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco\nmanagement and representatives from Lazard. During the meeting, representatives of Lazard reviewed the current state of the M&A\nenvironment generally and within the automotive sector and provided an\n32\nTable of Contents\nupdate on discussions with Apollo, including progress since the last Board meeting and an overview of key workstreams to support the\ntransaction process. In addition, the Lazard representatives reviewed the potential financial impact of the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air to\nTenneco\u2019s remaining business, including Tenneco\u2019s financial profile after completing the potential sale, the potential impact of pension and\nother liabilities on net proceeds from a potential transaction, the opportunity to reduce Tenneco\u2019s leverage ratio and the potential market\nreaction to the sale transaction.\nOn November 3, 2021, representatives of Latham had an initial call with representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell\u201d), legal\ncounsel to Apollo, to discuss process, timing and key workstreams with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Latham and\nWachtell, in certain cases joined by other legal counsel to Tenneco and Apollo, as applicable, had regular communications after this initial\ncall with respect to additional diligence and legal matters.\nOn November 9, 2021, Tenneco opened an electronic data room to Apollo and its representatives and financing sources, which was populated\nwith documentation in response to Apollo\u2019s due diligence requests.\nOn November 18, 2021, Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Michael Reiss of Apollo attended a dinner together in Chicago. Consistent with prior\ndiscussions Mr. Kesseler had with the Board, Mr. Kesseler communicated to Mr. Reiss over dinner that developing market conditions could\ncomplicate the ability of Tenneco to complete the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction without additional equity financing for the remaining\ncompany. Mr. Reiss suggested that Apollo could consider a potential private equity investment in the remaining company in connection with\nconsummation of the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction or otherwise could consider a potential purchase of the entire company.\nOn November 19, 2021, Tenneco\u2019s management and representatives of Lazard held an in-person meeting with representatives of Apollo, joined\nby Apollo\u2019s financial, accounting and strategic advisors, at the offices of Latham in Chicago. The Tenneco representatives reviewed the\nbusiness, operations and financial position of Powertrain and Clean Air and, in that context, responded to various due diligence questions\nposed by Apollo.\nOn November 21, 2021, in furtherance of the discussions between Mr. Kesseler and Mr. Reiss over dinner on November 18, 2021 regarding a\npotential private equity investment in the remaining company in connection with consummation of the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction or\na potential acquisition by the Apollo Funds of all of Tenneco, Apollo requested that Tenneco provide Apollo with business and financial\ninformation regarding the entire company.\nDuring the weeks of November 22, 2021 and November 29, 2021, Tenneco\u2019s management held multiple telephonic and videoconference\ndiligence sessions with representatives from Apollo, which sessions were also variously attended by Tenneco\u2019s outside advisors from Lazard\nand Latham and Apollo\u2019s outside advisors. Tenneco also continued to furnish additional documentation in the virtual data room in response to\nApollo\u2019s supplemental requests.\nOn November 26, 2021, representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Apollo to discuss status and timing, including Apollo\u2019s\nrequest for additional, more detailed diligence information, and Lazard\u2019s request, on behalf of, and at the direction of, Tenneco, that Apollo\nconfirm its proposed enterprise valuation would be at or above $4 billion for Powertrain and Clean Air. The Apollo representatives indicated\nthey expected to be in a position to confirm value on or prior to December 15, 2021, assuming Tenneco provided the requested additional\nthey expected to be in a position to confirm value on or prior to December 15, 2021, assuming Tenneco provided the requested additional\ndiligence information in a timely manner.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives from Lazard, to\nprepare for the special meeting of the Board scheduled for November 30, 2021. During the meeting, Mr. Masanovich provided an update on\ncurrent market conditions and changes in the market and business performance in the second half of 2021. Representatives of Lazard\nreviewed the strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including pursuing a standalone business strategy, the sale of Powertrain and Clean\nAir, the sale of DRiV, the sale of Motorparts and a sale of the whole company. The representatives from Lazard provided an update on the\nongoing discussions between Tenneco and Apollo. It was noted that, based on its work to date, Apollo indicated that it\nTenneco Inc.\n33\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nwould maintain its price range for Powertrain and Clean Air, and that, if necessary, Apollo was willing to consider a potential private equity\ninvestment in the remaining company. Alternatively, it was noted that Apollo had indicated that it would be willing to consider a potential\npurchase of the entire company and, in that context, had requested access to business and financial information regarding the entire\ncompany. The Transaction Committee determined to discuss these strategic alternatives with the full Board and noted that, if the Board\nsought to broaden the authority of the Transaction Committee to consider a wider range of strategic alternatives, the Board could do so at that\nmeeting.\nOn November 30, 2021, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco\u2019s management, as well as representatives from Lazard. During\nthe meeting, Mr. Masanovich provided an update on current market conditions and changes in the market and business performance in the\nsecond half of 2021, including a decline in global light vehicle production, increased material commodity and freight costs, inflation and a\nresulting increase in estimated leverage ratios for Tenneco for 2021 and possibly continuing into 2022. Representatives of Lazard reviewed\nwith the Board the strategic alternatives available to Tenneco, including pursuing a standalone business strategy, the sale of Powertrain and\nClean Air, the sale of DRiV, the sale of Motorparts and a sale of the whole company, and discussed the financial and qualitative\nconsiderations for each transaction alternative, including feasibility, value creation, and, except with respect to a whole company sale, the\nleverage profile for the remaining company and growth and margin profile of the remaining company from a public markets perspective. The\nLazard representatives also discussed Tenneco\u2019s capital structure, upcoming maturities, and options for refinancing Tenneco\u2019s indebtedness\nin light of the potential sale of Powertrain and Clean Air as compared to the other strategic alternatives. The representatives from Lazard\nprovided an update on the ongoing discussions between Tenneco and Apollo, noting that, based on its work to date, Apollo indicated that it\nwould maintain its price range for Powertrain and Clean Air, and that, if necessary, Apollo was willing to consider a potential private equity\ninvestment in the remaining company. Alternatively, it was noted that Apollo had indicated that it would be willing to consider a potential\npurchase of the entire company and, in that context, had requested access to business and financial information regarding the entire\ncompany. After discussion, the Board determined to authorize the Transaction Committee to broaden the scope of its review to cover, in\naddition to the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air, the potential sale of DRiV or a potential whole company sale transaction. The Board also\nauthorized management and Lazard to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction (including the\npotential for a private investment by the Apollo Funds in the remaining company) and also to explore the potential for a whole company\ntransaction with Apollo.\nDuring the week of December 6, 2021, representatives of Tenneco hosted representatives of Apollo and their outside advisors on six\nPowertrain and Clean Air plant tours of Tenneco facilities located in the United States, Germany, and Poland. Also during this week and\ncontinuing into the week of December 13, 2021, Tenneco\u2019s management, together with its financial and legal advisors, held multiple\ntelephonic and videoconference diligence sessions with representatives from Apollo and its advisors covering financial, legal, tax and other\ndue diligence matters. In addition, representatives of Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the\nstatus of legal diligence and the status of transaction documents for the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air.\nOn December 9, 2021, representatives of Latham circulated a draft equity purchase agreement to Wachtell with respect to the potential sale\nof Powertrain and Clean Air.\nOn December 10, 2021, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss certain diligence and transaction structuring\nmatters related to the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air.\nAlso on December 9, 2021, representatives of Lazard, acting at the direction of the Board, provided representatives of Apollo with a five-year\nfinancial projection scenario for Tenneco on a standalone basis based, in part, upon published IHS Markit Ltd estimates for global light vehicle\nproduction in 2022 through 2026. The projections provided to Apollo were referred to by the Board as the \u201cUpside Case\u201d.\nOn December 15, 2021, Apollo submitted a letter to Tenneco containing a non-binding indication of interest to acquire 100% of Tenneco for a\nprice of $16.00 to $18.00 per share of class A common stock in cash. Tenneco\u2019s share price closed at $10.32 per share at the end of trading\nthat day. Apollo also confirmed its offer for the Apollo Funds to acquire\n34\nTable of Contents\nPowertrain and Clean Air on the same terms originally proposed in October 2021. Apollo\u2019s proposal to acquire the whole company was\nsubject to completion of due diligence on DRiV (having already substantially completed due diligence on Powertrain and Clean Air) and\nnegotiation of definitive transaction documentation. Apollo indicated that, because the exclusivity period with Apollo formally expired at 5:00\np.m. Eastern Time on December 15, 2021, Apollo would require a new exclusivity period through the end of January 2022 to move forward with\neither its proposal to acquire Powertrain and Clean Air or its proposal to acquire the whole company.\nOn December 21, 2021, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and\nLatham, to review the status of Apollo\u2019s review of the potential acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air, as well as the non-binding indication of\ninterest submitted by Apollo and other strategic alternatives available to Tenneco. The parties at the meeting discussed the pro forma leverage\nprofile of Tenneco, assuming completion of the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction, highlighting the estimated net proceeds of the\ntransaction, the potential challenges of financing Tenneco after the completion of the transaction and the various net leverage profiles resulting\nfrom closing on the Powertrain and Clean Air transaction at different points throughout 2022. The Lazard representatives reviewed the financial\nconsiderations for the potential sale of the whole company, including Tenneco\u2019s preliminary annual operating plan for 2022 and management\u2019s\npreliminary five-year financial estimates, key business risks and opportunities for Tenneco, and preliminary illustrative valuation analyses with\nrespect to Tenneco\u2019s standalone business strategy. Representatives of Lazard also discussed potential alternative strategic and financial\nsponsor buyers for Tenneco in an entire company transaction. The Transaction Committee noted the challenges and risks to the remaining\ncompany if Tenneco executed the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction and concluded that the Board should consider pursuing the\npotential whole company sale alternative with Apollo.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Board held a special meeting attended by members of Tenneco management and representatives from Lazard\nand Latham to review the status of the potential acquisition of Powertrain and Clean Air by the Apollo Funds, as well as the non-binding\nindication of interest for the acquisition of the entire company submitted by Apollo and other strategic alternatives available to Tenneco. Mr.\nKesseler provided an update on the potential Powertrain and Clean Air transaction, highlighting the proposed purchase price and various\nfinancial considerations and challenges to the remaining company if Tenneco executed the Powertrain and Clean Air sale transaction. Mr.\nMasanovich reviewed the anticipated net proceeds in a Powertrain and Clean Air transaction, including the capital structure challenges\ncreated for the remaining company, the current status of Tenneco\u2019s banking relationships, and the impacts of net leverage of the proposed\nsale transaction. The Lazard representatives reviewed the financial considerations for the potential sale of the whole company, including\nTenneco\u2019s preliminary annual operating plan for 2022 and management\u2019s preliminary five-year financial estimates, key business risks and\nopportunities for Tenneco, and preliminary illustrative valuation analyses with respect to Tenneco\u2019s standalone business strategy.\nRepresentatives of Lazard also noted Apollo\u2019s request for exclusivity through the end of January 2022 and reviewed other potential alternate\nstrategic and financial sponsor buyers for Tenneco. Mr. Sabatino and representatives from Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary\nduties of the Board. After discussion, the Board determined that Apollo\u2019s offered range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share was inadequate. The\nBoard directed representatives from Lazard to communicate to Apollo that the Board had determined that a sale of Powertrain and Clean Air\nwas not likely to be viable in light of the challenges and risks to the remaining company following the sale and that Apollo\u2019s offered range for\nwhole company transaction was inadequate. It was noted that the Board would reconvene on January 4, 2022 to consider further Tenneco\u2019s\nstrategic alternatives and, in particular, whether Tenneco would be willing to engage in further discussions with Apollo and on what terms.\nOn December 23, 2021, representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Apollo and conveyed to Apollo that the Board had determined\nthat a sale of Powertrain and Clean Air was not likely to be viable in light of the challenges and risks to the remaining company following the\nsale, and also conveyed that Apollo\u2019s offered range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share for a whole company transaction was inadequate. The\nLazard representatives informed Apollo that the Board would meet again on January 4, 2022, and that the Lazard representatives may be able\nto provide more specific feedback on the offer following that meeting.\nTenneco Inc.\n35\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting in Chicago attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham to\nconsider further Tenneco\u2019s strategic alternatives and, in particular, whether Tenneco would be willing to engage in further discussions with\nApollo and on what terms. Representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board. Representatives of\nLazard reviewed the Board\u2019s extended process to explore strategic alternatives for Tenneco, stretching back to the announcement of the\nFederal-Mogul acquisition, and the desire to separate DRiV and Powertrain Technologies. No standstill provisions remained in effect at the\ntime with any third party other than Apollo, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no standstill provisions currently remain in effect with any third\nparty. Messrs. Kesseler, Masanovich and Richard M. Kwas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development, reviewed the\ncurrent market conditions in the auto industry, including increased volatility as a result of inflation, supply chain issues and general market\ntrends, and they noted the impact on the expected leverage profile and financial position of the remaining company if the Board were to\nproceed with the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air. Tenneco management then presented various five-year financial projection scenarios for\nTenneco on a standalone basis, including the \u201cUpside Case\u201d that had been furnished to Apollo on December 9, 2021, and that was based, in\npart, upon published IHS Markit Ltd estimates for global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026, and a so-called \u201cBase Case\u201d reflecting,\namong other things, management\u2019s estimates for global light vehicle production in 2022 through 2026. See \u201c\u2014 Certain Financial Projections\u201d\non page 53 of this proxy statement for summaries of the Upside Case furnished to Apollo and the Base Case authorized by the Board for use\nby Lazard in its financial valuation analyses.\nRepresentatives from Lazard then reviewed the potential risks and opportunities of various strategic alternatives available to Tenneco,\nhighlighting the challenges posed by the sale of Powertrain and Clean Air. The Board determined that neither the sale of Powertrain and Clean\nAir nor the sale of DRiV was actionable at that time for the various reasons previously discussed. The Board then discussed the whole\ncompany sale of Tenneco as the alternative most likely to maximize value for Tenneco and its stockholders, as compared to continuing to\nexecute Tenneco\u2019s strategic plan on a standalone basis. Mr. Kesseler and the Lazard representatives referenced Apollo\u2019s request for\nexclusivity and reviewed other potential alternate strategic and financial sponsor buyers for Tenneco. Representatives of Lazard reviewed prior\nmarketing efforts for Tenneco\u2019s business segments, and following discussion with management and taking into account advice from\nrepresentatives of Lazard and the fact that Tenneco had not received any outreach from third parties in response to Tenneco\u2019s public\nannouncements of its strategic review process, the Board believed it was unlikely that another strategic or private equity bidder would be\nwilling to offer a purchase price for Tenneco in excess of the current Apollo proposal. The Board also discussed the range of approaches to\n\u201ctest the market\u201d for a sale of the company, including potential targeted pre-signing outreach to potential bidders, a so-called \u201cgo-shop\u201d to\nallow Tenneco to solicit proposals after signing the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds and a so-called \u201cwindow shop\u201d that would\nallow the Board to consider and respond to unsolicited proposals received after signing the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds. After\ndiscussion, the Board instructed management and Lazard to advise Apollo that Apollo would need to increase its per share offer price for the\nwhole company to be \u201cin the twenties\u201d and be reflective of the 52-week high in Tenneco\u2019s stock of $22.27 in order to move forward with further\ndiscussions regarding the proposed whole company sale transaction and that the Board would request that the definitive transaction\ndocumentation include a customary \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the context of extending the exclusivity period for Apollo. The Board also\ndetermined that discussions and negotiations with respect to the potential sale of Tenneco would be administered at the full Board level and,\naccordingly, the Transaction Committee was disbanded.\nLater on during the afternoon of January 4, 2022, representatives of Lazard contacted representatives of Apollo to communicate that the\nproposed range of $16.00 to $18.00 per share was inadequate and that Apollo would need to increase its per share offer price for the whole\ncompany to be \u201cin the twenties\u201d and be reflective of the 52-week high in Tenneco\u2019s stock of $22.27 in order to move forward with further\ndiscussions. Mr. Kesseler subsequently spoke with the Apollo representative to reiterate the Board\u2019s position. Mr. Kesseler also noted that\nthe Board would request a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the definitive transaction documentation in recognition of the exclusivity period granted to\nApollo.\nOn January 5, 2022, representatives of Apollo contacted Mr. Kesseler and representatives of Lazard to convey Apollo\u2019s revised non-binding\nproposal to acquire Tenneco for $20.00 per share in cash, representing a 57% premium over\n36\nTable of Contents\nTenneco\u2019s then-current share price, subject to the completion of diligence, execution of definitive agreements and extension of Apollo\u2019s\nexclusivity period. Apollo\u2019s representative indicated that the $20 per share price represented the upper limit of what Apollo was authorized to\npay in an acquisition of Tenneco. Apollo also indicated that Apollo believed it could complete due diligence and be in a position to sign\ndefinitive documentation by February 24, 2022. Apollo\u2019s representatives acknowledged the Board\u2019s request for a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision but\nindicated that it would be discussed in connection with definitive transaction documentation. Apollo subsequently furnished its revised non-\nbinding proposal in writing for consideration by Tenneco\u2019s Board.\nOn January 7, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham, to review\nApollo\u2019s revised offer of $20.00 per share in cash and its request for exclusivity. Mr. Sabatino and representatives from Latham provided legal\nadvice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board. Representatives from Lazard reviewed the financial aspects of Apollo\u2019s revised proposal.\nThe Board discussed that Apollo continued to be the party most likely to offer the highest value for Tenneco, that the pool of other potential\nbidders was expected to be limited given current and prospective market trends, and that Tenneco had publicly announced that it was\nreviewing strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, but had not received any outreach from third parties in response. The Board\nauthorized management and the advisors to continue discussions with Apollo on the basis of its revised offer, including an extension of\nexclusivity to Apollo through February 21, 2022, in order to be in a position to consider definitive documentation prior to Tenneco\u2019s regularly\nscheduled earnings call.\nAfter the Board meeting on January 7, 2022, representatives of Lazard communicated to Apollo that Tenneco was prepared to extend\nexclusivity for purposes of negotiating a whole company transaction through February 21, 2022 based upon Apollo\u2019s non-binding proposal of\n$20 per share, and Tenneco and Apollo executed an exclusivity agreement extension on that basis. Later that day, representatives from\nApollo sent a business due diligence request list to Lazard, requesting customary business and financial data to allow Apollo to assess its\nvaluation assumptions with respect to Motorparts and Performance Solutions as well as confirmatory diligence items for their diligence with\nrespect to legal, environmental, health and safety, insurance, intellectual property and other similar matters.\nAlso on January 7, 2022 and thereafter on a regular basis, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss\ntransaction process and timing for the whole company transaction, the status of legal diligence and open items in the negotiation of definitive\ntransaction documents.\nOn or around January 10, 2022, representatives of Lazard provided Tenneco with a customary memorandum disclosing certain of Lazard\u2019s\nthen-current and historical relationships with Apollo and its affiliates.\nDuring January and February 2022, Tenneco also consulted with representatives of J.P. Morgan, a financial advisor to the Company, regarding\nthe financial condition and business of Tenneco, as well as the financial aspects of the proposed transaction with the Apollo Funds.\nOn January 18, 2022, Tenneco held a management meeting in Detroit, Michigan, covering Motorparts and Performance Solutions (formerly\nRide Performance) with representatives from Apollo, which was also attended by representatives from Lazard and Latham.\nDuring the week of January 24, 2022 and continuing into February 2022, Tenneco\u2019s management, together with representatives of Lazard and\nLatham, held multiple telephonic and videoconference diligence sessions with representatives from Apollo, including Apollo\u2019s outside advisors,\ncovering tax, information technology, cybersecurity, environmental, legal and financial matters. From January 24, 2022 through February 4,\n2022, members of Tenneco\u2019s management hosted representatives of Apollo and its outside advisors on six Performance Solutions and\nMotorparts plant tours of Tenneco facilities located in the United States, Mexico, Poland, Romania and Belgium.\nOn January 26, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss various legal issues, including the status of\nlegal diligence and key points for the definitive transaction documentation. Later that day, Latham sent an initial draft of the proposed Merger\nAgreement to Wachtell. Among other terms, the agreement\nTenneco Inc.\n37\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nincluded a 45-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d Tenneco termination fee with a lower termination fee of 1.25% of Tenneco\u2019s equity value\npayable if the agreement were terminated by Tenneco to accept a superior proposal during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period (as well as after the \u201cgo-shop\u201d\nperiod for certain exempted persons who approached the Company during the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period) and a termination fee of 2.5% of Tenneco\u2019s\nequity value after the \u201cgo-shop\u201d period. The proposed Merger Agreement also contemplated that Parent, Tenneco and their respective affiliates\nwould be required to divest assets, pursue litigation and take certain other actions, if necessary, to obtain antitrust and other regulatory\napprovals (a so-called \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory approvals provision), that Parent and its affiliates would not be permitted to engage in\nmergers or acquisitions prior to closing if such activity could materially delay closing or increase the risk of not obtaining any required\nregulatory approval and that Parent would be obligated to pay a reverse termination fee of 4% of the enterprise value of Tenneco if the Merger\nAgreement were terminated due to Parent\u2019s failure to consummate the Merger when required to do so under the Merger Agreement.\nOn January 29, 2022, the senior management of Motorparts and Performance Solutions and representatives of Lazard held an additional\nvideoconference diligence session with representatives from Apollo, including Apollo\u2019s outside advisors, regarding Motorparts and\nPerformance Solutions. Also on January 29, 2022, Tenneco executed an engagement letter with Lazard in connection with the proposed sale\nof Tenneco.\nOn February 1 and 2, 2022, the Board held a regular meeting at Tenneco\u2019s headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois attended by Tenneco\nmanagement and representatives of Lazard and Latham. During the meeting, the Lazard representatives provided an update on diligence and\nthe potential whole company sale to the Apollo Funds and provided a review of market conditions and the M&A landscape, highlighting recent\nmarket performance for the automotive sector. Representatives of Latham then reviewed the current status of legal discussions with Wachtell,\nas well as the anticipated transaction timeline. It was noted that Apollo had objected to the Board\u2019s request for a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, citing\nthe substantial premium proposed by Apollo and Tenneco\u2019s prior public announcements that the Board was open to reviewing strategic\nalternatives. The Board discussed that Apollo continued to be the party most likely to offer the highest value for Tenneco and that the pool of\nother potential bidders was expected to be limited given current and prospective market trends. The Board authorized management and the\nadvisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding a potential whole company transaction.\nAlso on February 1 and 2, 2022, members of Tenneco\u2019s management team covering Motorparts and Performance Solutions met with Apollo\u2019s\naccounting and strategic advisors at Tenneco\u2019s offices in Southfield, Michigan to discuss quality of earnings diligence.\nOn February 2, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the status of\nlegal diligence and key business issues related to the draft Merger Agreement provided by Latham. Later in the day on February 2, 2022,\nWachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement removed the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provisions,\nreplaced the \u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory efforts provision with a provision stating that Parent would not be required to make any divestitures,\nagree to regulatory remedies or commence any litigation in order to obtain required antitrust and regulatory approvals, removed the restriction\non Parent\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions prior to consummation of the Merger, increased Tenneco\u2019s termination\nfee to 3.5% of Tenneco\u2019s equity value, and lowered Parent\u2019s reverse termination fee to 3.5% of Tenneco\u2019s equity value. Wachtell\u2019s draft also\nadded a requirement for Tenneco to reimburse Parent for its deal-related expenses in the event that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders did not vote to\napprove the transaction at the stockholder meeting (regardless of whether the Board changed its recommendation or whether a competing\ntransaction had then been publicly announced).\nOn February 4 and 7, 2022, members of Tenneco\u2019s management met with Apollo\u2019s accounting and strategic advisors in Detroit, Michigan to\ndiscuss various due diligence matters.\nOn February 9, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing, the status of\nlegal diligence and open items in the negotiation of the Merger Agreement. Later in the day on February 9, 2022, Latham sent Wachtell a\nrevised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger\n38\nTable of Contents\nAgreement reinserted Tenneco\u2019s initial positions on the \u201cgo-shop\u201d, \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d Tenneco termination fee and the antitrust and regulatory efforts\nprovisions. The revised draft Merger Agreement also proposed a Parent termination fee equal to 4% of Tenneco\u2019s enterprise value, and deleted\nthe requirement for Tenneco to reimburse Parent for its expenses in connection with the transaction in the event that Tenneco\u2019s stockholder\ndid not vote to approve the Merger.\nOn February 14, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement made the\nsame edits as Apollo\u2019s prior draft of the Merger Agreement with respect to the deletion of the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provisions, Tenneco\u2019s termination fee\nof 3.5% of Tenneco\u2019s equity value, the antitrust and regulatory efforts provisions and Tenneco\u2019s obligation to reimburse Apollo\u2019s expenses\nupon Tenneco stockholders voting down the Merger (but added an upper limit of $20 million on this reimbursement obligation). The draft\nMerger Agreement from Wachtell also proposed a termination fee payable by Parent of 4.5% of Tenneco\u2019s equity value. Wachtell\u2019s draft\nMerger Agreement also modified the restriction on Parent\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 ability to pursue mergers and acquisition prior to closing to only\nrestrict activities that would be reasonably expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger prior to the \u201coutside date\u201d specified in the\nMerger Agreement.\nOn February 16, 2022, Latham sent Wachtell a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft required that Apollo only agree to\ndivestitures of, and regulatory remedies with respect to, Tenneco\u2019s businesses and assets (and not assets of any affiliates of Parent). The\nrevised draft also reinserted Tenneco\u2019s prior position on the \u201cgo-shop\u201d, Tenneco termination fees, Parent termination fee and Apollo\u2019s expense\nreimbursement proposal.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Board held a regular meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and Latham. During\nthe meeting, the Lazard representatives reviewed the history of the proposed transaction, an overview of due diligence and recent meetings\nwith representatives of Apollo, valuation and implied multiples of Apollo\u2019s proposal and current assumptions regarding the global light vehicle\nmarket. The Lazard representatives also reviewed Lazard\u2019s financial valuation analyses with respect to Tenneco using customary\nmethodologies, including discounted cash flow, a private market valuation and a public market valuation based on both the Base Case\nprojections (as discussed in \u201c \u2014 Certain Financial Projections\u201d on page 53 of this proxy statement) and consensus estimates. The Lazard\nrepresentatives further contextualized Apollo\u2019s offer by comparing it to Tenneco\u2019s 52-week high of $22.27 per share and 52-week low of $9.65\nper share and addressed the approximately $7.1 billion enterprise value of Tenneco implied by Apollo\u2019s offer. Representatives of Lazard also\ndiscussed current market trends and other potential buyers, noting the lack of outreach from third parties in response to Tenneco\u2019s public\nannouncements of its strategic review processes. Representatives of Latham then provided a status update on the negotiation of the proposed\nMerger Agreement, highlighting key terms and open business items, and received feedback from the Board with respect to those matters.\nRepresentatives of Latham also discussed applicable merger control and foreign direct investment approvals. The Board authorized\nmanagement and the advisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Merger.\nSeparately, on February 18, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a partially revised draft of the Merger Agreement reserving on the most significant\nopen business points and advancing legal and technical drafting matters that were previously unresolved in the Merger Agreement.\nOn February 19, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing and walk\nthrough the revisions in the draft of the Merger Agreement that Wachtell sent to Latham the prior day. Later in the day, Latham sent a revised\nincremental draft of the Merger Agreement to Wachtell, again reserving on the most significant open business points.\nOn February 20, 2022, representatives from Latham and Wachtell met telephonically to discuss transaction process and timing and walk\nthrough the revisions in the draft of the Merger Agreement that Latham sent to Wachtell the prior day.\nOn February 21, 2022, at the direction of Tenneco, representatives of Lazard spoke with Apollo regarding the significant open business issues\nin the Merger Agreement, focusing on the Board\u2019s request for a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, antitrust and regulatory considerations and termination\nfees and expense reimbursement obligations of the parties.\nTenneco Inc.\n39\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nLater in the day on February 21, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and\nLatham. Representatives from Latham reviewed the open business issues in the proposed Merger Agreement and Latham and Lazard\nresponded to questions and comments from the Board. The Board provided guidance on the remaining open business issues in the Merger\nAgreement and authorized management and its advisors to continue discussions with Apollo regarding the Merger. Mr. Kesseler advised that\nthe Board would reconvene on February 22, 2022 to review the proposed final Merger Agreement in detail, assuming Apollo and Company\nmanagement could reach agreement on final terms.\nFollowing the Board meeting on February 21, 2022, Mr. Kesseler spoke with a representative of Apollo regarding the remaining open business\nissues in the Merger Agreement. They agreed that Tenneco would accept removal of the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision in the final Merger Agreement in\nexchange for Apollo\u2019s agreement (i) to make divestitures and accept remedies to obtain applicable regulatory and antitrust approvals so long\nas it would not result in a material adverse effect on Tenneco and its subsidiaries, (ii) to a Parent termination fee of approximately 6.0% of\nTenneco\u2019s equity value and a Tenneco termination fee of approximately 3.0% of Tenneco\u2019s\u2019 equity value and (iii) to forgo expense\nreimbursement if Company stockholders vote down the Merger.\nOn February 22, 2022, Wachtell sent Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement reflecting the negotiation between the parties of the\npreviously open business points. The revised draft of the Merger Agreement modified the antitrust and regulatory efforts provisions to require\nParent to divest assets of Tenneco and its subsidiaries (and agree to remedies with respect thereto) and pursue litigation, in each case, if\nnecessary to obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals, except to the extent such actions would have or reasonably be expected to have\na material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The revised draft\nalso removed the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision, reduced the Tenneco termination fee to $54,000,000 (approximately 3.0% of transaction equity value)\nand increased the Parent termination fee to $108,000,000 (approximately 6.0% of transaction equity value). The revised draft also provided\nthat the $108,000,000 Parent termination fee would be payable in the event that certain closing conditions related to regulatory approvals were\nnot satisfied prior to the \u201coutside date\u201d where all other closing conditions were satisfied (provided that Parent would retain the right to waive\nsuch unsatisfied conditions and consummate the Merger rather than paying a termination fee). The revised draft accepted the removal of\nTenneco\u2019s obligation to reimburse Parent for its expenses in connection with the transaction in the event that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders do not\nvote to approve the Merger at the stockholder meeting. Over the remainder of the day on February 22, 2022, Latham and Wachtell traded\nfurther drafts of the Merger Agreement, making technical final revisions.\nLater in the day on February 22, 2022, the Board held a special meeting attended by Tenneco management and representatives of Lazard and\nLatham. During the meeting, representatives from Latham reviewed the proposed resolution of the key business points discussed with the\nBoard on February 21, 2022, the final terms of the Merger Agreement, the transaction timeline, and conditions and contingencies. The\nLatham representatives also provided legal advice regarding the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of the proposed\ntransaction and regarding a proposed amendment to Tenneco\u2019s bylaws to designate specified courts as the exclusive forum for certain types\nof litigation relating to Tenneco. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed Lazard\u2019s financial analyses and delivered its oral opinion to the Board\n(which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of February 22, 2022) to the effect that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be paid to Tenneco\u2019s stockholders (other than\nwith respect to shares of Tenneco\u2019s class A common stock held by holders who are entitled to, and have properly demanded, an appraisal of\ntheir shares and shares held by Tenneco as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of Parent)) in the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. Following this discussion, the Board\nunanimously (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in\nthe best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco for adoption,\n(iv) recommended that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and (v) adopted the amendment to Tenneco\u2019s bylaws designating\nspecified courts as the exclusive forum for certain types of litigation.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn the evening of February 22, 2022 the parties executed and delivered the Merger Agreement.

outside legal counsel and reviewing and considering various factors described in \u201c\u2014\nReasons for the Merger,\u201d (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable, fair\nto and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Tenneco\nfor adoption and (iv) recommended that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting of our Board on February 22, 2022, our Board (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Tenneco and its stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted

adoption and (iv) recommended that Tenneco\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIn reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by\nTenneco\u2019s stockholders, the Board evaluated the Merger Agreement and the Merger with Tenneco\u2019s executive management and Tenneco\u2019s\nfinancial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (which are not intended to be\nexhaustive or listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium of 100.4% to Tenneco\u2019s closing stock price on February 22, 2022, the last\ntrading day before the Merger Agreement was announced, and a premium of 71.6% over the 90-day volume-weighted average on the\nsame date\u037e\n\u2022\nuncertainties associated with the long-term risks and challenges in continuing to implement Tenneco\u2019s strategic plan, including

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Lazard Fr\u00e8res & Co. LLC\nThe Company has retained Lazard to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection with this engagement, the\nCompany requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company common stock (other than holders\nof Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger. On February 22, 2022, at a meeting of the Board\nheld to evaluate the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Lazard rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion dated February 22, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion, the Merger Consideration\nto be paid to holders of Company common stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view,\nto such holders.\nThe full text of Lazard\u2019s written opinion, dated February 22, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Appendix B and is incorporated by reference in this\ndocument. The summary of the written opinion of Lazard, dated February 22, 2022, set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of Lazard\u2019s opinion attached as Appendix B. Lazard\u2019s opinion was for the benefit of the\nBoard (in its capacity as such) and Lazard\u2019s opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger\nand did not address any terms or other aspects (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard\u2019s\nopinion) of the Merger. Lazard\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction\nor business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in\nthe Merger. Lazard\u2019s opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such\nstockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto.\nIn connection with its opinion, Lazard, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated February 22, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by the Company relating to the business of the Company, including\nfinancial forecasts identified as the \u201cBase Case\u201d prepared by management of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nheld discussions with members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the business and prospects of the Company\u037e\nTenneco Inc.\n45\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\n\u2022\nreviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business that Lazard believed to be generally relevant in\nevaluating the business of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business that Lazard believed to be\ngenerally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company common stock\u037e and\n\u2022\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.\nLazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such\ninformation. Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the\nCompany or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal.\nManagement of the Company advised Lazard that the Base Case best reflected the anticipated future financial performance of the Company\nand, accordingly, at the direction of the Board, Lazard utilized the Base Case projections for purposes of its analyses in connection with its\nopinion. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in Lazard\u2019s analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they\nhad been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance\nof the Company. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they are\nbased.\nFurther, Lazard\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on\ncircumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of\nCompany common stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. In connection with Lazard\u2019s engagement,\nLazard was authorized to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a potential transaction involving a portion of the\nCompany and was not authorized to, and did not, solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction involving the\nwhole Company. In addition, Lazard\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or\nbusiness strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger.\nIn rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Board, that the Merger will be consummated on the terms described in the\nMerger Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any terms or conditions that would be material to Lazard\u2019s analyses.\nRepresentatives of the Company advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the Merger Agreement, when executed, would conform to the\ndraft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of the Board, that obtaining the necessary\ngovernmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger will not have an adverse effect on the Company or the Merger\nthat would be material to Lazard\u2019s analyses. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from\nthe Merger, nor did Lazard\u2019s opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that the\nCompany obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or\nother aspects (other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard\u2019s opinion) of the Merger, including, without\nlimitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the\nMerger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger\nConsideration or otherwise.\nSummary of the Financial Analyses of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\nIn preparing its opinion to the Board, Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The summary set forth below does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying Lazard\u2019s opinion, nor does\nthe order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses. The preparation of a\nfinancial opinion or analysis is a complex\n46\nTable of Contents\nprocess involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or analysis is not readily susceptible to summary description. In\narriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in\nisolation, conclusions from or with regard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its\ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.\nAccordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in context. Lazard further\nbelieves that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all\nanalyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying its analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. No company, business or transaction\nreviewed is identical or directly comparable to the Company or its business or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of these analyses is not\nentirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions\nreviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions. Accordingly, such analyses may not\nnecessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could be deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of the\nCompany in or underlying Lazard\u2019s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative\nof actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those\nsuggested by the analyses. These estimates are necessarily subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based upon\nnumerous factors and events beyond the control of Tenneco and its advisors. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or\nsecurities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company may actually be sold or the prices at which any\nsecurities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of\nvaluations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as\nthe views of Lazard regarding the actual values of the Company. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the\nextent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 18, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative\nof current market conditions.\nLazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger. The type and amount\nof Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between the Company and Apollo Global Management,\nInc., rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of\nthe Board. Lazard\u2019s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and the\nMerger Consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to the Merger or the\nMerger Consideration payable in the Merger.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled \u201c\u2014Financial Analyses\u201d is a summary of the material\nfinancial analyses provided by Lazard in connection with its opinion, dated February 22, 2022, to the Board. The summary set\nforth below is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the\norder of the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The\nfinancial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard\u2019s\nfinancial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Future results may differ\nfrom those described and such differences may be material.\nTenneco Inc.\n47\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Analyses\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding\nfinancial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on Lazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered\ngenerally relevant for purposes of analysis. The selected companies used in this analysis were as follows:\nCOMPANY\nEV /\n2022\nEBITDA\nNon-Powertrain Peers\nAdient plc\n7.3x\nAutoliv, Inc.\n7.5x\nLear Corporation\n6.9x\nMagna International Inc.\n6.0x\nSuperior Industries International Inc.\n5.9x\nPowertrain Peers\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.\n4.9x\nBorgWarner Inc.\n5.3x\nDana Incorporated\n6.0x\nFaurecia SE\n6.6x\nLinamar Corporation\n4.1x\nMartinrea International Inc.\n3.6x\nValeo S.A.\n5.4x\nAftermarket Peers\nDorman Products, Inc.\n12.1x\nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company\n4.8x\nHolley Inc.\n10.7x\nMotorcar Parts of America, Inc.\n4.8x\nStandard Motor Products, Inc.\n7.4x\nLazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses similar in certain respects\nto the business of the Company. However, none of the selected companies is identical to the Company and certain of these companies may\nhave characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard\nbelieves that purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the Merger Consideration and that qualitative\njudgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the Company and the\nselected companies that could affect the public trading values of each company are also relevant.\nFor each selected company, Lazard calculated its enterprise value (defined as equity market value, plus debt, underfunded pension and other\npost-employment benefits obligations, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of its estimated\nEBITDA (defined as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of pensions and other\npost-employment benefits) for calendar year 2022 (\u201cEV / 2022 EBITDA\u201d). The median EV / 2022 EBITDA multiple observed for the Non-\nPowertrain Peers, the Powertrain Peers and the Aftermarket Peers was 6.9x, 5.3x and 7.4x, respectively.\n48\nTable of Contents\nUsing its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of estimated EV / 2022 EBITDA, derived from the EV /\n2022 EBITDA multiples of the selected companies, of 4.0x to 5.0x, to the Company\u2019s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022. This analysis\nresulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Company common stock of $0.00 to $10.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as\ncompared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of $20.00. Lazard noted that applying a 4.0x EV / 2022 EBITDA multiple to the\nCompany\u2019s estimated EBITDA for calendar year 2022 would result in a negative equity value and $0.00 per share represents a 4.3x EV / 2022\nEBITDA multiple. Lazard also applied these calculations utilizing selected Wall Street equity analysts\u2019 consensus estimates for the Company\nin lieu of the forecasts provided by the Company\u2019s management. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of\nCompany common stock of $9.70 to $27.60 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of\n$20.00.\nTenneco Inc.\n49\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nPrecedent Transactions Analysis\nLazard reviewed and analyzed, to the extent publicly available, financial information for selected precedent transactions involving (i) OE\nsuppliers and (ii) companies in the aftermarket sector, that Lazard believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, to be\ngenerally relevant for purposes of this analysis. Although none of the selected precedent transactions or the companies party to such\ntransactions is directly comparable to the Merger or to the Company, the selected precedent transactions were chosen because certain\naspects of the transactions, for purposes of this analysis and based on the professional judgment and experience of Lazard, may be\nconsidered similar to the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial\nand operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect\nthe Merger.

The\nmean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple observed for the selected OE Supplier transactions was 6.5x. The mean EV / LTM EBITDA multiple\nobserved for the selected aftermarket sector transactions was 8.6x. Lazard noted that public financial information was unavailable for certain\nof the transactions and such transactions were excluded from the calculations. Lazard applied a range of EV / LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.0x\nto 6.0x derived from the selected precedent transactions to the Company\u2019s 2021 EBITDA. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity\nvalue per share of Company common stock of $11.30 to $25.90 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger\nConsideration of $20.00.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nLazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company by calculating, based on the Base Case projections provided by the\nCompany\u2019s management, the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2021) of the stand-alone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that\nthe Company was forecasted to generate during calendar years 2022 through 2026. Lazard also calculated a range of implied terminal values\nfor the Company by applying a selected range of exit EBITDA multiples of 4.0x to 5.0x to the Company\u2019s estimated EBITDA for calendar year\n2026, which range of exit EBITDA multiples was selected based on Lazard\u2019s professional judgment and experience, taking into account,\namong other things, the trading multiples of selected publicly traded companies, the forecasts provided by the Company\u2019s management and\ntrends in the overall economy generally and in the industries and sectors in which the Company operates. The cash flows and range of\nimplied terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2021) using a selected range of discount rates of 10.5% to\n11.5% derived based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation.\nThis analysis resulted in a range of implied equity value per share of Company common stock of $15.15 to $29.00 (rounded to the nearest\n$0.05), as compared to the implied per share Merger Consideration of $20.00.\nTenneco Inc.\n51\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nOther Analyses\nLazard observed certain additional information that was not considered part of its financial analyses for its opinion but was noted for\ninformational reference for the Board, including the following:\nLeveraged Buyout Return Analysis\nLazard performed a leveraged buyout return analysis based on the Base Case projections provided by management of the Company, to\ndetermine the range of prices per share of Company common stock a financial buyer would be willing to pay to acquire the Company on a\nstand-alone basis with an illustrative capital structure that Lazard deemed to be achievable in the current market. For purpose of this\nanalysis, Lazard assumed a five-year investment period, target internal rates of return ranging from 15% to 20%, total leverage at closing of\n4.2x 2021 EBITDA and an exit multiple of 4.0x to 5.0x.

Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of\nthe DGCL is required. Failure to timely and properly comply with such statutory requirements may result in the loss or waiver of your\nappraisal rights.\nThis section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a full\nsummary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, which is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262\nof the DGCL to \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of Tenneco class A common stock. The following discussion does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Tenneco stockholder should exercise its\nright to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of Tenneco class A common stock, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, are the record holder of such shares and continuously hold such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and\nto receive the \u201cfair value\u201d of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger or related transactions) in cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. It is possible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less\nthan, or the same as, the Merger Consideration which Tenneco stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive upon the consummation of\nthe Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting at which the adoption of the Merger Agreement will be submitted\nto the stockholders, Tenneco must notify each stockholder who was a Tenneco\nTenneco Inc.\n61\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\nstockholder on April 20, 2022 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d) and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and\ninclude in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. THIS PROXY STATEMENT CONSTITUTES THE REQUIRED FORMAL NOTICE,\nAND A COPY OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IS ATTACHED AS APPENDIX C TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT.\nA HOLDER OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO\nPRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND APPENDIX C CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO\nCOMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER MAY RESULT IN\nTHE LOSS OR WAIVER OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE\nRIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHO IS\nCONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL.\nANY SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK HELD BY A TENNECO STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT,\nSUCCESSFULLY WITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN\nCONVERTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE TIME INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, WITHOUT INTEREST.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights\nIf you are a Tenneco stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Tenneco class A common stock, you\nmust comply with ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nyou must NOT vote \u201cFOR,\u201d or otherwise consent in writing to, the Merger Proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but\ndoes not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and\nwish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or as an abstention with\nrespect to, the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nyou must continuously hold your shares of Tenneco class A common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer your shares of Tenneco class A common stock before the Effective Time\u037e\n\u2022\nprior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver a proper written demand for appraisal of\nyour shares\u037e and\n\u2022\nyou (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of\nthe fair value of your shares of Tenneco class A common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under\nno obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation\nof Tenneco stockholders who seek to exercise their appraisal rights to initiate all necessary action to properly demand their appraisal\nrights in respect of shares of Tenneco class A common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nFiling a Written Demand\nNeither voting against the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a\nwritten demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. Any record holder of shares of Tenneco class A\ncommon stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Tenneco, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the\nspecial meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares. A stockholder\u2019s failure to deliver the written demand prior to\nthe taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting will result in a loss or waiver of appraisal rights. The written demand for\nappraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.\nA demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may demand appraisal rights\nfor the shares of Tenneco class A common stock registered in that holder\u2019s name. Such\n62\nTable of Contents\ndemand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Tenneco of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand\nappraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of his, her or its shares of Tenneco class A common stock. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the\nstockholder\u2019s name as it appears on the share certificate or certificates that represent such stockholder\u2019s shares or in the book entry that\nrepresents such stockholder\u2019s shares, as the case may be. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Tenneco class A common\nstock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Tenneco. The beneficial owner must, in such case, arrange for the holder of\nrecord, such as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Tenneco class A common\nstock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of Tenneco class A common stock as a nominee or\nintermediary for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Tenneco class A common stock held for one or more\nbeneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of Tenneco\nclass A common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock is expressly\nmentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Tenneco class A common stock held in the name of the holder of record. The\nfailure of a holder of record to properly and validly exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 on behalf of a beneficial holder may result in the\nloss or waiver of appraisal rights.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE\nFORMS, AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK\nHELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO\nCAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND\nYOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF TENNECO CLASS A COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK OR\nBROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE\nDEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE\nDEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.\nIf your shares of Tenneco class A common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian,\nexecution of the demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are owned of record jointly with one or more other\npersons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An\nauthorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however,\nthe agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting\nas agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their shares of Tenneco class A common stock in brokerage accounts or\nother nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to determine the\nappropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:\nTenneco Inc.\n7450 N. McCormick Blvd.\nSkokie, IL 60076\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any Tenneco stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger\nConsideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of Tenneco class A common stock by delivering to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal, but after such 60-day period, a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn\nonly with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation.\nTenneco Inc.\n63\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, Tenneco, as the Surviving Corporation, must notify each holder of\nTenneco class A common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor\nof the Merger Proposal of the date that the Merger has become effective.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not later, either you, provided\nyou have complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Surviving\nCorporation may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nSurviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by you, demanding an appraisal of the fair value of the shares of Tenneco class A common\nstock held by all stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or Tenneco, as the Surviving Corporation,\nis under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any intention to do so. If you desire to have your shares of Tenneco class A common\nstock appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for properly demanding your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the\nmanner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a holder of Tenneco class A common stock to file such a petition within the time\nperiods specified in Section 262 may nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to\nreceive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Tenneco class A\ncommon stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which Tenneco has received demands for appraisal, and the\naggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) 10 days after\nreceipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request therefor or (ii) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If\nyou are the beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf you may, in\nyour own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation, then your right to appraisal will cease.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record of Tenneco class A common stock who has properly exercised his, her\nor its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded payment for their shares of\nTenneco class A common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Tenneco class A common stock have not been\nreached by the Surviving Corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to\nthe Surviving Corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated as required by the court, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which Tenneco stockholders have complied with Section\n262 of the DGCL and have become entitled to appraisal rights and may require the Tenneco stockholders demanding appraisal who hold\ncertificated shares of Tenneco class A common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any Tenneco stockholder\nwho fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the\nhearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the\ncosts thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. In addition, because immediately before the Merger the shares will be listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights, unless (i) the total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of Tenneco class A common\n64\nTable of Contents\nstock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Tenneco class A common stock exceeds\n$1.0 million.\nThe appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Tenneco class A common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance\nwith the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Tenneco class A common stock held by all Tenneco\nstockholders who have properly demanded their appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the\nDGCL, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over\nthe Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the\nappraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination\nof the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation and who has\nsubmitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until\nit is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the\nSurviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as\nprovided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the Tenneco stockholders entitled to receive the\nsame, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the Surviving Corporation of their\nstock certificates. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment to each stockholder prior to such\nentry of judgement.\nAfter determining the holders of class A common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares of class A common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that\ncould be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are\ngenerally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making\nthis determination of fair value, the court may consider market value, asset value, the price negotiated by the parties, the unaffected stock\nprice, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger\nthat throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated\nthat \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,\ndepending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares, as so determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek\nappraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration\npayable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Tenneco believes\nthat the Merger\nTenneco Inc.\n65\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nConsideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the\nsame as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Tenneco nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder\nexercising appraisal rights, and each of Tenneco and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of\nSection 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of class A common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely\nfiled, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and\nthe fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. Absent such an order, each\nparty is responsible for his, her or its own expenses.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party, you may withdraw a demand for appraisal\nand accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration\npayable in the Merger to the Surviving Corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will\nrequire written approval of the Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to\nany stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any Tenneco stockholder that has made an appraisal\ndemand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to properly demand or\nsuccessfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of Tenneco class A common stock will\nbe deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less\nany applicable withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in the loss or waiver of your\nappraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of Tenneco class A common stock in\naccordance with the Merger Agreement.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL\nPREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. FAILURE TO STRICTLY FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 262\nOF THE DGCL MAY RESULT IN A WAIVER OR LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO\nEXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE\nANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S.\nholders (each as defined below) of Tenneco class A common stock who receive cash in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common\nstock pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all\npotential tax consequences of the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to\nincome tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is\nbased on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial\n66Table of Contents\ndecisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), in each case in effect as\nof the date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations, and any such change or differing\ninterpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this\ndiscussion. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to\nseek, any rulings from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following discussion. There can be\nno assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the Merger.\nThis discussion is limited to holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock who hold such shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences that may be relevant to a holder\u2019s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net\ninvestment income and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nto holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\npersons holding shares of Tenneco class A common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a\nconversion transaction or other integrated investment\u037e\n\u2022\nbanks, insurance companies and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\nbrokers, dealers or traders in securities\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS corporations\u201d or other\npass-through entities (and investors therein)\u037e\n\u2022\nreal estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations\u037e\n\u2022\npersons deemed to sell their shares of Tenneco class A common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who hold or received their shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or\notherwise as compensation\u037e and\n\u2022\ntax-qualified retirement plans.\nThis discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of Tenneco class A common stock\nwho exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of Tenneco class A common stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain\ndeterminations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding shares of Tenneco class A common stock and partners in such\npartnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.\nTenneco Inc.\n67\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE. HOLDERS OF TENNECO CLASS\nA COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME\nTAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY\nAPPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock that, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the\nmeaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for\nshares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for\nsuch shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for such share. The amount and\ncharacter of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be determined separately for each block of shares of Tenneco class A\ncommon stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized\nby a U.S. holder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will generally be capital\ngain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the effective time of\nMerger. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss which is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as\nordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a\nreduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to\ninformation reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). Such payments will not be subject to backup withholding\nif the U.S. holder (i) completes and returns to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal\ncertifying that the U.S. holder is a United States person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that the U.S. holder is not\nsubject to backup withholding or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption. Certain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup\nwithholding or information reporting.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit\nagainst the U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n68\nTable of Contents\nU.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for\nobtaining such an exemption.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a Non-U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Tenneco class A common stock that is neither a U.S.\nholder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nA non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares\nof Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,\nmaintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition of shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger and certain other requirements are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nat the time of the Merger, Tenneco is a U.S. real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes or has\nbeen a USRPHC at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding\nperiod for its shares of Tenneco class A common stock, and the non-U.S. holder owned (actually or constructively) more than five percent\nof the total fair market value of the outstanding shares of Tenneco class A common stock at any time during such applicable period.\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular U.S.\nfederal income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may\nbe subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on such\neffectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.\nA non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such\nlower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of\nTenneco class A common stock in the Merger, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the\nindividual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with\nrespect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, although there can be no assurances in this regard and Tenneco has not made a definitive\ndetermination, Tenneco believes that it is not currently a USRPHC and has not been a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on the date\nof the Merger. Even if Tenneco is or was a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger, gain realized by a non-U.S.\nholder on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock in the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax if Tenneco class A common stock continues to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange at the time of the Merger and such\nnon-U.S. holder owned (actually or constructively) five percent or less of the total fair market value of the outstanding shares of Tenneco class\nA common stock during the applicable period.\nNon-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nTenneco Inc.\n69\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to non-U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Tenneco class A common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to\ninformation reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to\ninformation reporting and backup withholding if the non-U.S. holder (i) provides the paying agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN,\nW-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder\u2019s non-U.S. status (and the\npaying agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person) or (ii) otherwise establishes an\nexemption.\nCopies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty or information\nexchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit\nagainst a non-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nThe discussion above of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to constitute a complete description of\nall tax consequences relating to the Merger. This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax or legal\nadvice. Because individual circumstances may differ, each holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the applicability of\nthe rules discussed above to the holder and the particular tax effects to the holder of the Merger in light of such holder\u2019s\nparticular circumstances, including the tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or through the\napplication of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or any applicable income tax treaty.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nTenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are\nnecessary, proper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate and\nmake effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable. These approvals\ninclude the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as\namended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) and clearance of the Merger having been granted by relevant antitrust and foreign direct investment authorities in\ncertain other jurisdictions.\nIn addition, each of Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (1) cooperate reasonably with each other\nin connection with regulatory filings or submissions in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any\ninvestigation or other inquiry by a governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (2)\npromptly inform the other parties of material communications received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the\nDepartment of Justice or any other similar governmental entity (foreign or domestic)\u037e (3) consult with each other prior to taking any material\nposition with respect to the regulatory filings or submissions\u037e (4) permit the other parties\u2019 legal counsel to review and discuss in advance any\nanalyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any governmental entity with respect to\nregulatory approvals\u037e and (5) coordinate with the other parties\u2019 legal counsel in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly\nprovide the other parties\u2019 legal counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or material submissions made by such party with any\ngovernmental entity with respect to regulatory approvals. Parent will, with prior notice to and consultation of Tenneco, and taking Tenneco\u2019s\nviews into account in good faith, control and lead all communications and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to regulatory approvals.\nIf and to the extent necessary to obtain any regulatory approval required for the closing of the Merger or to avoid the entry of or have lifted or\nterminated any order restraining or enjoining the Merger, Parent will (1) propose, negotiate\n70Table of Contents\nand offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale or other disposition of any assets or\nbusinesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries\u037e (B) behavioral limitations on the assets or businesses of Tenneco or its subsidiaries\u037e and (C) the\ntermination, modification, transfer or other action with respect to any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Tenneco\nor its subsidiaries\u037e (2) otherwise offer to take action that it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take such action, that limits or\naffects its freedom of action\u037e and (3) in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably\nforeseeable to be entered that would make consummation of the Merger unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the Merger,\nany and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent is not required to\ntake any of the foregoing actions to the extent such actions would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the\naggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Tenneco and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after\ngiving effect to the Merger.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the Merger cannot be completed\nuntil Tenneco and Parent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the\n\u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub\nsubmitted a notification to the FTC on March 8, 2022, and the applicable waiting period expired on April 7, 2022. Accordingly, the transaction\nhas been cleared by the FTC.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR\nAct, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including\nseeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or\nhold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and\nnotwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or\nseeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under\ncertain circumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws\nEuropean Union. Both Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, conduct business across the European Union in multiple member\nstates. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,\nwhich we refer to as the \u201cEU Merger Regulation\u201d, mergers and acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European\nUnion sales exceeding specified thresholds must be notified to, reviewed and approved by the European Commission before they are\nimplemented. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore\nobligated to (i) notify the transaction to the European Commission of and (ii) wait to implement the merger until after the European\nCommission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the common market. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub submitted a\ndraft filing to the European Commission on March 28, 2022 and intend to file a formal notification to the European Commission as soon as is\nreasonably practicable.\nCanada. In addition, under the Competition Act of Canada, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue thresholds cannot\nbe consummated until they are filed, reviewed and approved by the Competition Bureau of Canada. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their\naffiliates, have sufficient revenues to exceed the relevant statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned\nupon the Competition Bureau\u2019s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a notification to the Competition Bureau on March 17, 2022.\nOn March 21, 2022 the Competition Bureau issued an Advance Ruling Certificate (\u201cARC\u201d) pursuant to section 102 of the Competition Act by\nwhich it granted the relevant regulatory approval.\nChina. Under the Antimonopoly Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue\nthresholds cannot be consummated until they are notified to, reviewed and approved by the State\nTenneco Inc.\n71\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nAdministration for Market Regulation, which we refer to as \u201cSAMR.\u201d Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, have sufficient\nrevenues to exceed SAMR\u2019s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR\u2019s approval.\nTenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a notification to SAMR on April 8, 2022.\nJapan. Under the Anti-Monopoly Act of Japan, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue thresholds cannot be\nconsummated until they are notified to, reviewed and approved by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which we refer to as \u201cJFTC\u201d.\nTenneco, Parent and Merger Sub have sufficient revenues to exceed the relevant statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger\nis therefore conditioned upon JFTC\u2019s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a draft notification to JFTC on April 22, 2022.\nMexico. Under the Federal Economic Competition Law of Mexico, transactions involving parties having sales and assets in Mexico exceeding\nspecified thresholds must be notified to, reviewed and approved by the Federal Economic Competition Commission, which we refer to as\n\u201cCOFECE\u201d. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub, or their affiliates, have sufficient revenues and assets to exceed COFECE\u2019s statutory\nthresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon COFECE\u2019s approval. Tenneco, Parent and Merger Sub filed a\nnotification to COFECE on April 8, 2022.\nOther Regulatory Approvals. Completion of the transaction is further subject to the receipt of additional clearances and/or approvals under the\nantitrust laws of certain other jurisdictions. This includes, among other jurisdictions, potential clearances and/or approvals under the antitrust\nlaws of Russia and Ukraine. Apollo may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive the receipt of such Russian and/or Ukrainian approvals and/or\nclearances as conditions to the consummation of the Merger.\nForeign Direct Investment Laws\nCompletion of the merger is further subject to receipt of foreign direct investment approvals in Spain and Australia. Tenneco, Parent and\nMerger Sub filed the respective notifications to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism of Spain and the Foreign Investment Review Board\n(\u201cFIRB\u201d) of Australia on March 31, 2022.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary\napprovals and consents to the Merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn\nregulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no\nway to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and\nthere may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Tenneco stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory\nclearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not\ninvolve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThese conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.",

This summary is not complete and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A and incorporated into this proxy\nstatement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain\nall the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express\nterms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement\nThe Merger Agreement and the summary of terms included in this proxy statement have been prepared to provide you with information\nregarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. Factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in this proxy statement or in Tenneco\u2019s public\nfilings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), as described in \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d on page 160\nof this proxy statement, may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Tenneco contained in the Merger Agreement and in\nthis summary. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates and solely for the benefit of parties to the Merger Agreement, and:\n\u2022\nwere negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the\nright not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in\ncircumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as\nfacts\u037e\n\u2022\nhave been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made among the parties to the Merger Agreement in\nconnection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself\u037e\n\u2022\nmay no longer be true as of a given date\u037e\n\u2022\nmay be subject to a contractual standard of materiality in a way that is different from those generally applicable to you or other\nstockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC\u037e and\n\u2022\nmay be subject, in some cases, to other exceptions and qualifications, including exceptions that do not result in, and would not\nreasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, as defined in \u201c\u2014Representations and Warranties\u201d on page 78 of\nthis proxy statement.\nStockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants\nand agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Tenneco, Parent or Merger Sub or\nany of their respective affiliates or businesses.

Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties,\nwhich do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and\nsubsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may not be included in this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions of the Merger Agreement or any description of such provisions\nshould not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, as well as the disclosures in Tenneco\u2019s periodic and current reports, proxy\nstatements and other documents filed with the SEC.

At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to\nbe deposited, with the paying agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time.

If, after the Effective Time, stock certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any\nreason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the Merger Agreement.\nIf any cash deposited with the paying agent remains unclaimed by the holders of stock certificates or book-entry Shares on the first\nanniversary of the Effective Time, such cash will be returned to the Surviving Corporation and any holder of Shares who has not tendered its\nstock certificates or book-entry Shares for the Merger Consideration prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving\nCorporation for the delivery of the Merger Consideration (without any interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, abandoned property,\nescheat or other similar laws).

need for a Board Recommendation Change\u037e and\n\u2022\nfollowing the notice period, the Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) determines that the failure\nof the Board to make such a Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary\nduties pursuant to applicable law.\nIn the event of any material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, Tenneco is required to deliver a new written notice to Parent\ndescribing such modifications and to again comply with the negotiation obligations described above for an additional three business days\nfollowing such new notice.\nNothing in the Merger Agreement limits Tenneco\u2019s or the Board\u2019s ability to (i) take and disclose to

        "Section Text": "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OUTCOMES FOR 2021\nKey decisions and pay outcomes under our 2021 executive compensation program included:\n\u00b7\nAt the outset of the year (February 2021), the committee reviewed the base salaries of those named executive officers then employed\nby the company, other than Mr. Kesseler, and approved increases in base salaries that ranged between 0% and 3.2% over 2020. Base\nsalary increases were determined based on performance and whether the executive had received a base salary increase in 2020. Mr.\nKesseler\u2019s base salary remained the level last reviewed and approved in the Fall of 2020 as previously disclosed.\n\u00b7\nIn November 2021, the company reviewed the peer group which was previously established in July 2020 for compensation benchmarking\npurposes. No changes to the peer group were made.\n\u00b7\nAnnual cash incentives based on 2021 results were declared in early 2022 as follows:\nAIP payout\nTaking into account a calculation 50% based on Enterprise EBITDA and 50% based on Enterprise FCF performance\nof the company, each named executive officer was eligible to receive an AIP payout equal to 100% of his target\npayout (\u201cEligible Payout\u201d).\nEach named executive officer\u2019s final AIP payout was determined by multiplying his Eligible Payout by his individual\nperformance factor as determined by the committee: Mr. Kesseler \u2013 110%, Mr. Masanovich\u2014115%, Mr. Baird\u201491%,\nMr. Jueckstock\u201475% and Mr. Norton\u201493%.\n124Table of Contents\n\u00b7\nLong-term incentives for the 2019 through 2021 performance period, which were granted in early 2019, were determined in early 2022\nand earned as follows:\nPSUs payout\nMessrs. Kesseler and Norton, as holders of PSUs granted by the company in 2019, earned their PSUs for the 2019\nthrough 2021 performance period at 100% of target level and Mr. Jueckstock, as a holder of PSUs granted by the\ncompany in 2019, earned his PSUs for the 2019 through 2021 performance period at 40% based on metrics as\ndescribed below.\nNo PSUs\ngranted\nMessrs. Masanovich and Baird did not hold any PSUs or awards in respect of the 2019 through 2021 performance\nperiod.\nImpact of 2020-2022 PSU Grant on 2021 Compensation\nFor accounting reasons described below, each named executive officer\u2019s 2020-2022 PSU award granted in early 2020 was not reflected in the\nSummary Compensation Table as 2020 compensation. Instead, the value of these 2020 awards is required to be included in the Summary\nCompensation Table as 2021 compensation, which results in 2021 compensation including two annual performance award grants and thus\nappearing higher than it otherwise would.\nDue to the uncertainty created by COVID in 2020, the committee did not establish performance metrics under the 2020-2022 PSUs during the\ncourse of 2020 despite establishing a target level of payout for each named executive officer at the beginning of 2020 consistent with normal\npractice. Over the course of 2020, the committee periodically revisited the long-term performance program, but continued to defer establishing\nperformance goals due to ongoing COVID uncertainty. In November 2020, the committee converted the dollar value targets into units based on\nthe 10-day volume weighted average price for the period ended March 4, 2020 in order to align executive compensation with the financial\ninterests of our stockholders, with the PSUs to be settled in cash. At the time, the committee also determined that financial performance for\n2020 would not be a factor in these awards but instead that the committee would establish targets for 2021 and 2022 in 2021.\nConsequently, because the compensation committee determined to establish performance targets in 2021 for the 2020-2022 PSUs, these\nawards had no grant date fair value in 2020 under applicable accounting rules and were not permitted to be included in the Summary\nCompensation Table as 2020 compensation. Instead, they are included as 2021 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.\nBelow sets forth, for each named executive officer, i) the intended dollar value of the PSU awards granted in 2020 for the 2020 through 2022\nperformance period, ii) what the aggregate pro forma total compensation would have been for 2020 had the grant date fair value of 2020-2022\nPSU award been reported in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for 2020, and iii) what the aggregate pro forma total\ncompensation would have been for 2021 had the grant date fair value of the 2020-2022 PSU award been removed in the 2021 Summary\nCompensation Table (based on actual determination dates):\nNAME\n2020-\n2022\nPSU\nVALUE\n($)\n2020\nPRO FORMA\nTOTAL\nCOMPENSATION\n($)\n2021\nPRO FORMA\nTOTAL\nCOMPENSATION\n($)\nMr. Kesseler\n3,600,000\n10,960,510\n10,491,546\nMr. Masanovich\n1,100,000\n2,986,068\n3,548,401\nMr. Baird\n1,200,000\n3,755,743\n4,177,069\nMr. Jueckstock\n870,000\n3,073,056\n3,146,951\nMr. Norton(1)\n801,187\nN/A\n3,148,524\n(1) Mr. Norton was not a named executive officer for 2020, so his 2020-2022 PSU value reflects the actual value at the time of award.\nTenneco Inc.\n125\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nResults of Say-on-Pay Vote and Stockholder Engagement\nOur stockholders hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation (the \u201csay-on-pay proposal\u201d).

Excluding abstentions, approximately 91% of the shares voted were voted in favor of the proposal. As part of our overall corporate\ngovernance, we have an on-going outreach program to develop and maintain communication with our investors. Throughout 2021, members of\nour management team continued to engage in stockholder outreach with our largest stockholders, highlighting a number of key topics,\nincluding our approach to executive compensation, and environmental, social and governance matters. We value this engagement and the\nBoard considers pertinent feedback when evaluating compensation and governance issues. The committee will continue to consider the\noutcome of the annual say-on-pay proposal when making future compensation decisions for our executives.

For the other\nnamed executive officers, Mr. Kesseler formulated the initial recommendations regarding salary, annual cash incentive award targets and\nequity-based and other long-term incentive compensation awards. The committee reviewed these recommendations in light of market data\nprepared by\nTenneco Inc.\n127\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\nMeridian. For other forms of compensation and benefits, management generally makes initial recommendations that are considered by the\ncommittee.\nOur general policy is to provide salary, annual cash incentive payments and equity-based and other long-term incentive compensation to\nnamed executive officers that is competitive with the market and comparable companies when financial and qualitative performance targets\nare met. Actual salaries may vary reasonably below or above the median when considering scope of responsibilities and experience,\ndevelopment opportunity, changes in responsibilities, and individual and business performance. In making its determinations regarding these\nelements of compensation, the committee regularly reviews data regarding compensation practices at other companies that it determines to\nbe relevant to compensation matters affecting our company.\nThe benchmarking information we use in establishing salary, annual cash incentive payments and equity-based and other long-term incentive\ncompensation typically includes the most recently available data regarding publicly traded companies comparable to our company in terms of\nindustry, proximity, annual revenue and/or other factors. For 2021 compensation determinations, specific data was reviewed regarding a\ncomparison group consisting of the following companies:\n2021\nCompensation\nPeer Group\nAdient PLC\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.\nAptiv PLC\nAutoliv, Inc.\nBorgWarner Inc.\nCarrier Global Corporation\nCummins Inc.\nDana Incorporated\nDeere & Company\nEastman Chemical Company\nEaton Corporation plc.\nEmerson Electric Co.\nGenuine Parts Company\nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company\nHoneywell International Inc.\nIllinois Tool Works Inc.\nJohnson Controls International plc.\nLear Corporation\nLKQ Corporation\nNavistar International Corporation\nOshkosh Corporation\nPACCAR Inc.\nParker-Hannifin Corporation\nTrane Technologies plc\nWhirlpool Corporation\nW. W. Grainger, Inc.\nIn addition, the committee reviewed aggregate data regarding a broader group of durable goods manufacturers (that were not specifically\nidentified to the committee). This data was prepared by Meridian and compared targeted compensation paid by these companies to their\nexecutive officers in specified positions to the compensation we pay to named executive officers in the same or similar positions.\nFor 2021, Mr. Kesseler reviewed with and recommended to the committee the annual salary, incentive plan target and equity-based and other\nlong-term compensation for each of our named executive officers and other key management personnel (excluding Mr. Kesseler). The\ncommittee reviewed those recommendations and made a final determination with respect to such compensation.\nIn general, the compensation that is developed for each of the named executive officers is based on competitive market data and on\nrecommendations regarding the executive\u2019s overall contributions, past performance and anticipated future contributions. The committee also\nreviews the executive\u2019s performance separately and sets the salary, incentive plan target and equity-based and other long-term compensation\nof the Chief Executive Officer based on competitive market data as well as the committee\u2019s assessment of the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s past\nperformance and anticipated future contributions.\n128\nTable of Contents\nDESIGN AND ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION",

        "Section Text": "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS\nIn January 2015, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Kesseler that was amended on October 1, 2018 which is described further below.\nIn October 2018, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Jueckstock that is described further below.\nIn October 2018, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Norton, including a letter communicating his transition to his new position in May\n2021, which is described further below.\nIn July 2020, we entered into offer letters with each of Messrs. Baird and Masanovich which are described further below.\nRetirement Plans\nWe offer to our U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based named executive officers, customary, tax-qualified defined\ncontribution retirement (401(k)) plans. Beginning in 2007 (for Tenneco employees) and 2019 (for Federal-Mogul employees) the defined\ncontribution plans provide for a company match on employee contributions of 100% on the first 3% of an employee\u2019s pay and 50% on the\nnext 2% of an employee\u2019s pay, which we believe to be in line with prevailing practices for major U.S. corporations. In addition to this matching\ncontribution, we also provide a company contribution (called a \u201cCompany Retirement Contribution\u201d) which is a percentage of a participant\u2019s\ncompensation (between 2.5% and 4% for years beginning in 2021) that is determined based on the individual\u2019s age. Participants are eligible\nto receive Company Retirement Contributions after they have completed 12 months of service with the company.\nWe also maintain unfunded non-qualified defined contribution retirement plans (the \u201cExcess Benefit Plans\u201d). Our named executive officers and\nother senior managers are eligible to participate in an Excess Benefit Plan, with allocations under the plans generally calculated in the same\nmanner as under the applicable existing defined contribution retirement plans, except that (i) Company Retirement Contributions under the\nplans are made based on compensation that includes bonus compensation payable in accordance with the AIP formula (or other annual\nbonus formula in effect at the relevant time) and (ii) contributions under the plans are based on compensation in excess of the Section 401(a)\n(17) limitations of the Internal Revenue Code.\nTenneco Inc.\n133\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual MeetingTable of Contents\nUnder the terms of his offer, Mr. Kesseler was entitled to receive an Excess Benefit Plan contribution of 3% of compensation (including bonus\ncompensation) through December 31, 2019. Thereafter, Mr. Kesseler\u2019s benefit under the Excess Benefit Plan is to be determined in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the Excess Benefit Plan.\nFor U.S.-based executives we (and Federal-Mogul prior to the acquisition) previously offered defined benefit retirement plans that were\ncustomary for the automotive industry and, in the case of the Tenneco plans, were consistent with similar plans maintained by the\nconsolidated Tenneco Inc. prior to our becoming a stand-alone public company in 1999. These plans included:\n\u00b7\na customary tax-qualified retirement plan that was generally available to all U.S.-based salaried employees (see \u201c\u2014 Post-Employment\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u00b7\na supplemental executive retirement plan for Tenneco executives for periods prior to January 1, 2007, which we call the \u201cSRP\u201d (see \u201c\u2014\nPost-Employment Compensation \u2014Supplemental Retirement Plan\u201d).\nAlthough benefits under both the qualified defined benefit plans and the SRP were frozen, prior earned benefits under the plans were\npreserved.\nMr. Jueckstock, a native of Germany, participates in a defined benefit schedule of the Federal-Mogul German Pension Plan in lieu of the U.S.\ndefined contribution plan. The company makes contributions not to exceed 125,000 Euros per year to the Federal-Mogul German Pension\nPlan on his behalf pursuant to his offer letter.\nPerquisites\nAs part of our competitive compensation plan, the NEOs are eligible for limited perquisites provided by or paid for by the company. We offer\nthe NEOs and certain eligible executives an executive annual physical, which some chose to utilize in 2021. Perquisites provided are\nreviewed on a regular basis. For each named executive officer, the aggregate value of any such perquisites to each such executive was less\nthan $10,000.\nSeverance Benefits\nWe have agreed to pay our Chief Executive Officer two times his then-current salary and two times target bonus for the year in which\ntermination occurs if we terminate his employment other than for disability, cause or in connection with a change in control. We view these\nbenefits as customary and a key element of the recruiting and retention of executives in light of company and industry specific factors.\nWe maintain a Severance Benefit Plan that applies to all U.S. salaried, full-time employees with at least three months of service who are\nterminated by us without cause or in connection with a reduction in force or similar layoff. The benefits payable under this plan are described\nunder \u201c\u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation \u2014 Severance Benefits.\u201d We most recently amended the plan in April 2020 to\nreflect prevailing market practices.\nChange in Control\nWe maintain a Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives (the \u201cCIC Executive Severance Plan\u201d) to enable us to retain and\nmotivate highly qualified employees by eliminating, to the maximum practicable extent, any concern that their job security or benefit\nentitlements will be jeopardized by a \u201cchange in control\u201d of our company.\nAs of year-end, our plan applied to thirteen members of management. The CIC Executive Severance Plan generally provides for cash benefits\nconsisting primarily of a multiple (two or three times) of an officer\u2019s annual salary and annual targeted cash incentive if the executive officer is\nactually terminated (other than for cause, death or disability) or constructively terminated on or within two years following a change in control.\nSee \u201cPost-Employment Compensation \u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment Compensation \u2014 Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for\nKey Executives.\u201d We amended and restated our CIC Executive Severance Plan in November 2020 to reflect current market practices and to\nconform the provisions to certain other plans that we maintain, including updating the definition of change in\n134\nTable of Contents\ncontrol thereunder and eliminating the parachute tax gross-up provisions which have not applied to any of our executives for several years. Mr.\nKesseler\u2019s cash payment in connection with a change in control termination will equal three times the total of his then current base salary\nplus his targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control. The cash payment in connection with a change in control\ntermination for each of Messrs. Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock and Norton will equal two times the total of his then current base salary plus\nhis targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control.\nIn addition, the terms of our 2006 LTIP (and our prior long-term incentive plans), provided for awards to vest upon a change in control, unless\nthe committee otherwise provides in an award agreement. Effective for grants of awards made on or after November 5, 2020, including for\ngrants made under the current long-term incentive plan, we amended the 2021 LTIP to eliminate the single trigger vesting. For a more detailed\ndescription of the treatment of awards upon a change in control see \u201cPost-Employment Compensation \u2014 Other Potential Post-Employment\nCompensation \u2014 Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives.\u201d\nEQUITY AWARD POLICY",

The purpose of the plan is to enable us to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly\nqualified employees by eliminating, to the maximum practicable extent, any concern on the part of such employees that their job security or\nbenefit entitlements will be jeopardized by a \u201cchange in control\u201d of our company. The plan was amended and restated effective as of November\n5, 2020 to conform certain provisions of the plan to our long-term incentive plan, to eliminate references to tax gross-ups which do not apply\nto any of our employees and to make other technical and conforming changes.\nUnder the plan, as amended, a \u201cchange in control\u201d happens if:\n\u00b7\nany person or group acquires (A) 30% or more of the voting power of our then-outstanding securities having general voting rights or (B)\n40% or more of our outstanding shares of class A common stock and class B common stock in the aggregate subject to limited\nexceptions\u037e\n\u00b7\nour incumbent directors cease to constitute a majority of our Board\u037e\n\u00b7\nthere is a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all the assets in which our stockholders own less than 50% of the new\ncompany\u037e or\n\u00b7\nwe are liquidated or dissolved.\nBenefits under the plan are payable to a key employee whose employment is terminated (either actually or constructively) on or within two\nyears after a change in control. Under the plan, we must pay an eligible executive a lump sum cash payment equal to one, two or three\ntimes, depending on their grouping under the plan, (i) their base salary and (ii) their targeted annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the\nchange in control. In addition, we must provide the executive with (a) a pro rata bonus at target (payable in a lump sum), (b) one, two or three\nyears (depending on their grouping under the plan) of health and welfare benefits continuation, (c) out placement services and (d) all deferred\ncompensation (payable in a lump sum, subject to applicable plan provisions and applicable tax rules). Awards under our 2006 LTIP are\nsubject to the terms of the 2006 LTIP while awards under our 2021 LTIP are subject to the terms of the 2021 LTIP (or successor). Gross-up\npayments were completely eliminated with the November 5, 2020 amendments to the long-term incentive plan and none of the named\nexecutive officers were entitled to gross-up payments prior to the amendment.\nUnder our 2006 LTIP for grants made prior to November 5, 2020, upon a change in control, all options and stock appreciation rights will\nimmediately vest and remain exercisable for up to 36 months and all restrictions on outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units\nwill lapse and our LTPUs and PSUs shall be deemed fully earned on the date of the change in control and paid based on assumed\nachievement of targeted performance goals. Under our 2006 LTIP for grants made on or after November 5, 2020 or under our 2021 LTIP, unless\nthe committee determines that performance conditions can be determined on substantially the same basis as prior to the change in control,\nany performance conditions applicable to outstanding performance awards or cash incentive awards will be deemed to have been achieved at\nthe target level of performance for the performance period in effect on the date of the change in control and any service-based conditions\napplicable to such awards will continue to apply as if the change in control had not occurred. If a participant\u2019s employment or service\nterminates on or within 24 months following the change in control due to termination for cause or good reason (each as defined in its\nrespective long-term incentive plan) all then outstanding awards will vest upon the termination and any options or stock appreciation rights will\nremain exercisable for 24 months following the termination. In the event that awards granted on or after November 5, 2020 are not continued,\nassumed or replaced in connection with the change in control, the outstanding awards will become fully vested upon the change in control\n(with performance being determined at target in the case of performance awards) and will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment or\nother consideration generally provided to stockholders in the change in control.\n148Table of Contents\nMessrs. Kesseler, Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock, and Norton would have become entitled to receive payments from us as follows had we\nexperienced a change in control on December 31, 2021 (assuming termination on that date, including, to the extent applicable, with respect\nto LTPUs, options, PSUs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, as described above).\nNAME\nSEVERANCE\nAMOUNT\nBONUS \nAMOUNT\nEARLY\nVESTING\nOF\nAWARDS(2)\nOTHER\nBENEFITS(3)\nEXCISE\nTAX\nGROSS\nUP(4)\nTOTAL(5)\nMr. Kesseler\n$\n9,000,000\n$\n1,800,000\n$\n18,307,096\n77,739\n$\n29,184,835\nMr. Masanovich\n$\n2,960,000\n$\n680,000\n$\n4,306,023\n40,491\n$\n7,986,514\nMr. Baird\n$\n3,500,000\n$\n875,000\n$\n4,976,247\n51,141\n$\n9,402,388\nMr. Jueckstock\n$\n3,610,000\n$\n855,000\n$\n3,293,170\n57,864\n$\n7,816,034\nMr. Norton\n$\n2,595,600\n$\n576,800\n$\n3,137,400\n36,049\n$\n6,345,849\n(1) Represents the value of all unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and the full value of all unearned PSUs at target based on the closing price of a share of our class A common\nstock on December 31, 2021.\n(2) Represents welfare benefits (medical, dental, life and disability) and outplacement services.\n(3) Executives are not entitled to any excise tax gross up or reimbursement by the company.\n(4) The amounts presented are estimated without any allocation of amounts payable to service prior to or after the change in control.\nSeverance Benefits\nIf Mr. Kesseler was involuntarily terminated by us other than for disability or cause or in connection with a change in control, he would have\nbeen entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two times his respective annual base salary and two times his targeted annual bonus\n(which lump sum amount would have been $6,000,000 for Mr. Kesseler as of December 31, 2021).\nWe maintain a Severance Benefit Plan that applies to all U.S. salaried, full-time employees (including officers) with at least three months of\nservice and who are not eligible for any type of severance or termination benefit with respect to a termination otherwise covered by the\nSeverance Benefit Plan or who are otherwise covered by any other severance plan or agreement. The Severance Benefit Plan was most\nrecently amended as of April 1, 2020 to add additional requirements relating to the receipt of severance benefits, to change the severance\npayment period (from a lump sum to installments) and to make technical and conforming changes. The Severance Benefit Plan provides\nbenefits for eligible employees whose termination of employment occurs as a result of a \u201cCovered Termination\u201d (which generally means a\ntermination by the company without cause (as defined in the plan) or termination by the employee due to constructive discharge (also as\ndefined in the plan)). Under this plan, eligible employees who are officers and whose employment is terminated by the company without\ncause or due to a constructive discharge will be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to (1) one year of base salary plus target\nbonus and (2) a medical subsidy payment which is 52 times (or such lower number of weeks included in the severance payment) (a) the\nemployer-paid portion of the monthly premium for medical coverage for the employee under the company\u2019s medical plans (determined as of\nthe termination date) divided by (b) four. Outplacement services are also provided. Severance payments under the Severance Benefit Plan are\npaid in substantially equal installments over the severance period and all payments (and other benefits) are discontinued if the individual\nobtains alternative employment (determined in accordance with the terms of the plan) after termination of employment with the company. The\nSeverance Benefit Plan would apply to Messrs. Masanovich, Baird, Jueckstock, and Norton, each of whom we expect would have received\ncash payments of $1,520,491, $1,801,141, $5,203,145, and $1,334,875, respectively, if his employment had been terminated by us on\nDecember 31, 2021 under circumstances not covered by another severance plan or arrangement (in addition to outplacement services) and\nassuming that no alternative employment was obtained after termination with the company. We require participants to sign a customary\nrelease to receive benefits under this plan.\nTenneco Inc.\n149\n2022 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting\nTable of Contents\nDeath or Disability\nUnder our AIP, unless provided by the administrator, a participant, including any named executive officer, is entitled to a pro rata bonus of the\nactual amount of the bonus that would have been earned for the performance period if their employment is terminated due to death or\ndisability.
