If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders and the Merger\nis completed, the Merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the Company\u2019s\nshareholders fail to approve this Compensation Proposal.\nQ:\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nThe Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share represents a 48% premium to the closing price of the Common\nStock as of February 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated\nby reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important,\nregardless of the number of shares of Common Stock you own.\nVoting at the Special Meeting\nShareholders of record will be able to attend the special meeting virtually and vote electronically via the special\nmeeting website. If you are not a shareholder of record but instead hold your shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your\nbroker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting. You will be able to attend the\nspecial meeting online and to vote your shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTOR2022SM.\nIt is not necessary to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares of Common Stock. To ensure that\nyour shares of Common Stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting\ninstructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.\nAttending the special meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy\nvia:\n\u2022\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed\npostage-paid envelope\u037e\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\ntelephone, by using the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet, at www.proxyvote.com.\nThe telephone and Internet voting facilities for shareholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nMay 25, 2022.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted\n\u201cFOR\u201d (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the special meeting.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the approval of the Merger\nProposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the\ndirections provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held in 401(k) Plan Account\nIf you hold shares in a Meritor 401(k) plan account, you should follow the directions provided by the plan\nadministrator or plan trustee regarding how to instruct the plan trustee how to vote your shares.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a shareholder of\nrecord, you may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company in writing, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at\nour headquarters, 2135 West Maple Road, Troy, Michigan 48084-7186, or by submitting a new proxy with a later\ndate, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any time up to 11:59\np.m. Eastern Time on May 25, 2022, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to\nthe Company. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting virtually and voting\nelectronically at the special meeting\u037e however, simply attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to\nbe revoked. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by\nsending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or\nwritten notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your\nshares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke\nyour prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by\nvoting electronically at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker,\nbank or other nominee in order to be able to vote at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of\nCommon Stock outstanding on April 11, 2022, the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not\nvote, or abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal, or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give\nvoting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Proposal.\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares of\nCommon Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the special meeting and that vote thereon. If you\nabstain from voting on (i) the Compensation Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal or if you do not return\nyour proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares of Common Stock (including a failure of your broker, bank\nor other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), it will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a\nquorum is present.\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWill my shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or held in another form of record ownership be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a\ndifferent shareholder (that is, your broker, bank, or other nominee) than any shares of Common Stock you hold\nof record, any shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with\nshares of Common Stock held of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered\nforms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and\nwill need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common Stock because they are held in a\ndifferent form of record ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business entity must be\nvoted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the\nproxy card.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of Common Stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive\nmore than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting\ninstruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of\nyour shares of Common Stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger?\nA:\nIn order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock through completion\nof the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger, you\nwill have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nThe record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the\nMerger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the closing of the Merger,\nyou will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nIf the Merger is completed, how do I obtain the Merger Consideration for my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the\nright to receive your portion of the Merger Consideration. After the Merger is completed, if your shares of\nCommon Stock are evidenced by stock certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials\nfrom the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common\nStock evidenced by stock certificates for the Merger Consideration (without interest and subject to any required\ntax withholding). If your shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other\nnominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you\nneed to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration\n(without interest and subject to any required tax withholding).\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of Common\nStock with the proxy card. If the Merger is completed and if your shares of Common Stock are evidenced by\nstock certificates, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and\ninstructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (without interest and\nsubject to any required tax withholding).\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nshareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance\nnotice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of\nthe meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of\ncommon stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you\nmay have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The\nbroker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral\nrequest. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about Meritor?\nA:\nYou can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the costs of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nThe Meritor Board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the\ncharges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of\nour outstanding common stock. Meritor has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (which we refer to as\n\u201cInnisfree\u201d), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist the Meritor Board in the solicitation of proxies for the special\nmeeting, and we expect to pay Innisfree approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable and\ndocumented out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone, or\nvia the Internet by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by certain of Meritor\u2019s directors, officers and\nemployees.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the Merger or any of the other matters set forth in this proxy statement, or\nrequire assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or\nthe enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and information\nagent for Meritor in connection with the special meeting.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of Meritor\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Meritor\nBoard and Meritor\u2019s senior management periodically review, consider and assess Meritor\u2019s capabilities, operations,\nfinancial performance and business plans, as well as overall industry conditions, opportunities and risks for the\ncompany as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the\nconsideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships\nand other financial and strategic alternatives.\nFrom the summer of 2019 to March 2020, representatives of Parent and the Company engaged in preliminary,\nexploratory discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction, following discussions with, and authorization by,\nthe Meritor Board with the Meritor Board receiving advice and analysis from Meritor\u2019s outside financial and legal\nadvisors at J.P. Morgan and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) and the Parent Board with the\nParent Board receiving advice and analysis from Parent\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors at Morgan Stanley and\nMayer Brown LLP (\u201cMayer Brown\u201d). While Parent ultimately conveyed possible interest in pursuing a transaction at\na proposed valuation of $33.00 per share in cash (which interest was formalized in a non-binding letter setting forth\nsuch proposal that was provided by Parent on February 13, 2020), and Parent had the opportunity to engage in\npreliminary confidential business, financial and strategic diligence discussions that affirmed the strategic logic of a\ncombination pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement that Parent had entered into with Meritor (the\n\u201cOriginal Confidentiality Agreement\u201d), Parent withdrew and terminated transaction discussions in March 2020 after\nthe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in March 2020, Meritor sent Parent a letter requesting that it return or\ndestroy the diligence information that had been shared by Meritor and in April 2020, Parent sent a letter to Meritor\nconfirming the destruction of such diligence information.\nThrough 2020 and 2021, Meritor continued to evaluate regularly its business and strategic plans, industry dynamics,\nMeritor\u2019s positioning with investors and other stakeholders, opportunities and risks before the Company and\npotential strategic and financial alternatives, including Meritor\u2019s periodic discussions with Parent regarding various\nstrategic collaboration opportunities other than a business combination or merger.\n22TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn November 2020, as part of the Company\u2019s planned succession planning processes, Meritor announced that Jay\nCraig, Chief Executive Officer and President of Meritor, would transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the\nMeritor Board on February 28, 2021, and that Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,\nwould succeed Mr. Craig as Chief Executive Officer and President at that time and would join the Meritor Board.\nMeritor\u2019s then-current independent Chairman, William R. Newlin, became lead independent director of the Meritor\nBoard as part of this transition plan. On November 12, 2021, Meritor announced that Mr. Newlin had been elected\nNon-Executive Chairman, effective December 31, 2021, with Mr. Craig stepping down from his Executive Chairman role\nand departing the Company.\nIn mid-November 2021, Tom Linebarger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Parent, conveyed to Mr. Craig that\nParent was interested in re-engaging in discussions to acquire Meritor. Mr. Craig indicated that he would apprise the\nMeritor Board. The Meritor Board was then alerted of the development, the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors at\nJ.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton were also apprised, with future meetings of the Meritor Board to be scheduled at\nwhich the Meritor Board would deliberate and receive the advice of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton, including in the\nevent that Parent were to provide a specific proposal and indicative valuation that could warrant further\ninvestigation, potential negotiation and consideration.\nThroughout November and December 2021, and continuing into 2022, members of Meritor\u2019s senior management\nregularly consulted with Mr. Newlin in his capacity as lead independent director and Non-Executive Chairman of the\nMeritor Board, in between the scheduled meetings of the Meritor Board to obtain his input and direction as to next\nsteps. Meritor Board members were also kept apprised of developments.\nOn November 18, 2021, Parent and Meritor entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement (the \u201cNew\nConfidentiality Agreement\u201d) with substantially similar terms as those of the Original Confidentiality Agreement.\nFollowing further discussion, Parent was advised that Meritor would require receipt of a specific proposed valuation\nin order to assess potential next steps and that, since Meritor planned to disclose to investors at Meritor\u2019s December\n7, 2021 Strategy Day meaningful amounts of new business and financial information regarding Meritor\u2019s plans and\nprospects, Meritor would share with Parent in advance of such public disclosure, pursuant to the New\nConfidentiality Agreement, the information that Meritor would be making public so that such materials could be\nconsidered in any proposal that Parent might make.\nOn November 22, 2021, Meritor provided Parent with an advance copy of materials it planned to publicly disclose at\nits December 7, 2021 Strategy Day, pursuant to the New Confidentiality Agreement. Meritor responded to certain\nfollow-up questions from Parent on December 8, 2021.\nOn December 14, 2021, Mr. Linebarger conveyed to Meritor that Parent was interested in acquiring Meritor and sent a\nletter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Craig setting forth a non-binding proposal (the \u201cDecember Proposal\u201d) for Parent to\nacquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for $33.50 per share in cash. The December Proposal noted\nthat the proposal would not be contingent on financing. The December Proposal also indicated that Parent expected\nto be able to complete its due diligence of Meritor within a period of weeks.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, the Meritor Board reviewed the\nDecember Proposal and discussed the interactions with Parent. The Meritor Board discussed the December Proposal,\nincluding in the context of financial analyses and alternatives presented by J.P. Morgan to the Meritor Board. A\nrepresentative of Wachtell Lipton provided an overview of the Meritor Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in the context of the\nconsideration of a proposal to acquire Meritor. The Meritor Board discussed potential options and next steps, and\ndirected Meritor to provide Parent with a short period of limited due diligence in order to seek an increase in the\n$33.50 per share offer price, which the Meritor Board believed undervalued Meritor, its prospects and its plans.\nOn December 21, 2021, Mr. Villavarayan, at the direction of the Meritor Board, provided a letter to Mr. Linebarger to\nconvey the Meritor Board\u2019s position.\nBetween December 24, 2021 and January 13, 2022, J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Meritor Board and management,\nand Meritor personnel provided limited due diligence information to representatives of Parent, and representatives of\nParent had several due diligence calls with members of senior management of Meritor, including a management\npresentation by Meritor.\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 14, 2022, Mr. Linebarger submitted a letter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Newlin containing a non-binding\nproposal (the \u201cFirst January Proposal\u201d) for Parent to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for\n$35.00 per share in cash. The First January Proposal noted the transaction would not be contingent on financing. The\nFirst January Proposal also indicated that Parent expected to be able to complete its remaining due diligence of\nMeritor within approximately three weeks.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ndescribed the due diligence process with Parent, as well as the financial terms of the First January Proposal and J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s financial analysis of the proposed merger consideration set forth in the First January Proposal. A\nrepresentative of Wachtell Lipton discussed legal matters, including an overview of the Meritor Board\u2019s fiduciary\nduties in the context of the Meritor Board\u2019s consideration of the First January Proposal. The Meritor Board discussed\nvarious options and next steps, and directed Meritor to provide Parent with additional due diligence information in\norder to seek an increase in the offer price, which the Meritor Board believed continued to undervalue Meritor. The\nMeritor Board also considered whether to solicit indications of interest from other potential financial sponsors or\nstrategic buyers and concluded, with the benefit of advice from J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton, not to do so at this\ntime, while reserving ultimate judgment on the matter, taking into account the risk of leaks, the damage and disruption\nto Meritor and its stakeholders, including employees and customer relationships, were a leak to occur in the absence\nof a definitive transaction announcement, the uncertainty as to whether alternative compelling third-party bids would\nemerge (and the Meritor Board\u2019s believed low likelihood of such bids emerging) and the benefits from continuing to\nsee if Parent could present a compelling proposal.\nOn January 21, 2022, Mr. Villavarayan, at the direction of the Meritor Board, met with Mr. Linebarger to convey the\nMeritor Board\u2019s position at its January 18 meeting and to discuss the need for Parent to submit an improved proposal\nif Parent wished to have the opportunity to have the Meritor Board consider a potential transaction with Parent.\nOver the next few days, Meritor provided Parent with additional due diligence information, and an additional meeting\nwas held between senior management of Meritor and senior management of Parent regarding areas of additional\nvalue in the transaction that would justify Parent increasing its offer price.\nOn January 26, 2022, Mr. Linebarger submitted a letter to Messrs. Villavarayan and Newlin containing a non-binding\nproposal (the \u201cSecond January Proposal\u201d) for Parent to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Meritor for\n$36.50 per share in cash, which Parent characterized as its last and final offer. The Second January Proposal requested\nthat Parent be provided a three week exclusivity period to complete confirmatory due diligence and negotiate\ndefinitive transaction documentation.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan\ndescribed the interactions with Parent since the January 18, 2022 Meritor Board meeting and the financial terms of the\nSecond January Proposal, as well as J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial analysis of the proposed merger consideration set forth\nin the Second January Proposal. A representative of Wachtell Lipton discussed legal matters, including the Meritor\nBoard\u2019s fiduciary duties in the context of the Meritor Board\u2019s consideration of the Second January Proposal. The\nMeritor Board next discussed the Second January Proposal, including in comparison to Meritor\u2019s standalone\nprospects, as well as whether other potential bidders would be capable of and willing to offer a more attractive value\nthan Parent\u2019s $36.50 per share all-cash proposal. The Meritor Board determined not to solicit alternative third-party\ninterest at this time due to, among other things, potential impact on Parent\u2019s proposal and the risk of a leak, as well as\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the low likelihood of obtaining a superior offer for Meritor. The Meritor Board\nauthorized management to continue to explore a transaction with Parent by moving forward with due diligence and\nnegotiation of definitive documentation so that the Meritor Board would have the opportunity to consider a complete\nproposal inclusive of all material terms and to do so without entering into an exclusivity agreement with Parent.\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Villavarayan called Mr. Linebarger to provide a summary of the Meritor Board\u2019s position at its\nmeeting that day. A representative of J.P. Morgan then sent, at the direction of the Meritor Board, a draft merger\nagreement to representatives of Morgan Stanley that had been prepared by Wachtell Lipton.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt the end of January into February 2022, Meritor made available to Parent and Parent\u2019s representatives certain due\ndiligence information in a confidential data room. Thereafter, Parent, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted\nadditional due diligence on Meritor, including through telephone calls with Meritor management and exchange of\nmaterials.\nOn February 5, 2022, a representative of Parent\u2019s outside legal counsel from Mayer Brown sent a revised draft of the\nmerger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.\nOn February 10, 2022, a representative of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Mayer Brown. Through the course of negotiations, Wachtell Lipton and Mayer Brown discussed\nvarious items in the merger agreement, including regulatory provisions, termination fee amounts, interim operating\ncovenants and fiduciary matters.\nBetween February 10, 2022 and February 21, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Mayer Brown, with input\nfrom Meritor and Parent, continued to exchange and negotiate drafts of the merger agreement.\nAlso on February 10, 2021, Messrs. Villavarayan and Linebarger discussed certain key issues in the merger\nagreement.\nOn February 14, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. At the meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan\npresented an update on the diligence process to date and representatives of Wachtell Lipton presented an update on\nmerger agreement negotiations with Parent and a range of potential approaches to finalizing the merger agreement.\nAfter discussing, the Meritor Board determined that Meritor should continue the current course of negotiations with\nParent.\nAlso on February 14, 2021, Messrs. Villavarayan and Linebarger discussed the key issues in the merger agreement.\nBetween February 14, 2022 and February 21, 2022, the parties and their respective advisors worked to finalize the\ndefinitive transaction documents, with all remaining open points having been substantially resolved by the afternoon\nof February 21, 2022.\nOn February 21, 2022, the Meritor Board held a meeting during which members of Meritor\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and J.P. Morgan were present. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton again reviewed\nthe fiduciary duties of the directors and provided a summary of the proposed terms of the merger agreement. A\nrepresentative of J.P. Morgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial analysis of the proposed Merger Consideration in\nthe proposed transaction with Parent. After discussion among the Meritor Board and representatives of Wachtell\nLipton and J.P. Morgan, a representative of J.P. Morgan tendered to the Board J.P. Morgan\u2019s oral opinion, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by the delivery of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion, dated February 21, 2022, to the Meritor\nBoard to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations\nand qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed\nMerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. After additional discussions of the proposed\ntransaction and the matters summarized for the Meritor Board at the meeting, the Meritor Board unanimously (1)\napproved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (2)\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and\nits shareholders, (3) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company\u2019s shareholders for their\napproval and (4) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement.\nLater in the evening on February 21, 2022, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement.\nEarly in the morning on February 22, 2022, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.",

        "Section Text": "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Meritor Board\nThe Meritor Board evaluated, with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, the Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions, including the Merger, and, on February 21, 2022, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement\nand the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and approved,\nadopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn the course of making the unanimous recommendation, the Meritor Board considered a range of factors, including\nthose below (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance) relating to the Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions, including the Merger, each of which the Meritor Board believed supported its decision:\n\u2022\nthe Meritor Board\u2019s assessment of Meritor\u2019s business, assets, current and projected financial performance\nand condition, earnings, prospects and outlook, including taking into account Meritor\u2019s potential for, and\nrisks and uncertainties to, future growth and value creation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the Company\u2019s shareholders immediate\ncertainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Common Stock and enables the Company\u2019s shareholders\nto realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution\nrisk\u037e\n\u2022\nthe information provided by Meritor\u2019s financial advisor\u037e\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the shares of Common Stock, including the market performance\nof the shares of Common Stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry and\ngeneral market indices and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share represented a\npremium of approximately 48% to the closing price on the last trading day before the Merger Agreement\nwas executed and reflected an implied transaction multiple above the select precedent transaction multiples\nused in the Company\u2019s financial advisor\u2019s analysis\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meritor Board\u2019s view of industry trends, the substantially increasing levels of capital investment\nneeded to navigate the evolving electrification environment and the increasing number and size of\ntraditional and emerging competitors, including those with substantially enhanced scale relative to the\nCompany and the various risks and considerations with respect to continuing to execute the Company\u2019s\nstandalone plans and operating as an independent public company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Company\u2019s customers will benefit from the combined company\u2019s enhanced capabilities in\nproduct offerings for internal combustion and electrified powertrain application, and in technology and the\nability to accelerate investment in axle and brake development and electric vehicle refinements with\nincreased adoption in the markets as a result of the Transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that Meritor and Parent have complementary portfolios that will help the combined company\ndevelop economically viable zero carbon solutions for commercial and industrial applications and the belief\nthat Meritor and Parent share a similar customer-first focus and commitment to excellence, innovation,\ncollaboration and technology leadership\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Merger provides a unique opportunity to better serve and innovate for Meritor\u2019s\ncustomers, and to access new customers around the world, enhance overall community value through\nincreased investment and provide new and expanded career and growth opportunities for Meritor\nemployees\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Company\u2019s employees should benefit from the greater stability and opportunities\nprovided by the combined company\u2019s enhanced ability to invest in new product offerings and advanced\ntechnology\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meritor Board\u2019s concern regarding the potential impact of any potential economic downturn on the\nprice of shares of Common Stock (and on the potential valuation that counterparties would be willing to\npay)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe course and history of the negotiations between Meritor and Parent, as described under \u201c- Background\nof the Merger,\u201d including the Meritor Board\u2019s success in having Parent raise its offer several times for the\nbenefit of Meritor\u2019s shareholders through constructive engagement and achieve a level reflecting a\nsubstantial premium and a favorable valuation relative to various metrics and methodologies and the\nMeritor Board\u2019s belief that Parent\u2019s offer of $36.50 per share was Parent\u2019s best and final offer, which best\nand final status was affirmed by Parent and Parent\u2019s representatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the Meritor Board that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms for\nthe Company, in the aggregate, to which Parent was willing to agree\u037e\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe belief, based on the advice of Meritor\u2019s financial advisor and its knowledge of the industry and the\noperations of Meritor, that it was unlikely that any other financial sponsors or strategic buyers would be\nwilling to acquire Meritor at a price in excess of $36.50 per share in cash (and no such party had submitted\nsuch a bid) and agree to and ultimately consummate the Merger on the terms set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, and that if Meritor were to conduct an auction process or other active solicitation of alternative\nacquisition proposals, doing so would create risk and possible loss or destruction of value\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meritor Board\u2019s belief that Parent may have pursued business combinations, acquisitions or\npartnerships with other third parties in the event the Merger was not consummated, creating potential long\nterm risks and potentially adverse impacts to the Company, including if such developments were to occur\nand strengthen other companies to Meritor\u2019s detriment\u037e\n\u2022\nthe high degree of certainty that the closing will be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, including, among other things, that the effects of COVID-19 were excepted from the\ndefinition of a Company Material Adverse Effect, and other provisions and protections increasing the level\nof certainty afforded to the Merger ultimately being consummated\u037e\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 21, 2022, that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein,\nthe Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such shareholders, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c- Opinion of Meritor\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Merger Agreement be approved by the holders of a majority of all the votes\nentitled to be cast to approve the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which the Meritor Board believed are\nreasonable and customary in number and scope\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably\npractical, the risk that a condition to closing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable\nflexibility to operate Meritor\u2019s business during the pendency of the Merger, including with respect to\nactions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Meritor Board, subject to certain conditions, to\nprovide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an\nunsolicited Company Takeover Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Meritor Board to withdraw or change its\nrecommendation of the Merger Agreement and to terminate the Merger Agreement, in certain\ncircumstances relating to the presence of a Company Superior Proposal (or to effect a Change of\nRecommendation in response to an Intervening Event) subject, in certain cases, to paying the\nCompany Termination Fee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and Parent\u2019s ability to finance the\nMerger without difficulty\u037e\n\u2022\nthe customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Meritor in the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of Meritor to specifically enforce Parent\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement,\nincluding Parent\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Termination Date, as it may be extended, if applicable, allows for sufficient time to\ncomplete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental\napprovals with respect to the Merger, including agreeing to remedies as necessary to obtain any\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch approval, subject to certain limitations as to the remedies and actions that Parent would be\nrequired to take, which limitations and other relevant provisions are further described under the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Efforts to Complete the Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain\ncircumstances, Parent will pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee as more fully described under\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Parent Termination Fees\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Meritor Board\u2019s view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third\nparties from making a Company Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement\u2019s terms and conditions\nrelated to a Change of Recommendation, the Company\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in favor\nof an alternative Company Superior Proposal if certain provisions were satisfied, the payment by the\nCompany of a relatively low Company Termination Fee in connection with the termination of the Merger\nAgreement under certain circumstances, and the Board\u2019s belief that the overall terms relating to the\nforegoing were appropriate and favorable to the Company and its shareholders taking into account the\nspecific circumstances involved (see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement -\nCompany Takeover Proposal\u037e Non-Solicitation\u201d).\nIn addition, the Meritor Board also weighed the advantages and benefits against a variety of risks and other\npotentially negative factors (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance), including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company\u2019s shareholders generally will have no ongoing equity participation in the\nCompany following the Merger, and that such shareholders will cease to participate in the Company\u2019s\nfuture earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of shares of Common\nStock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of the Company to a third party\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation\nthat may result from the announcement or pendency of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to complete the Merger\nwill be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if the Merger\nAgreement is approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u2019s restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the completion of\nthe Merger, generally requiring the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course , subject to\nspecific limitations and certain exceptions, which may nevertheless delay or prevent the Company from\npursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and taking other actions with respect to its business\nthat the Company may consider advantageous pending completion of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management\nand employee attention, potential effects on the ability to retain employees and the potential effect on\nbusiness and customer and supplier relationships\u037e\nbusiness and customer and supplier relationships\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that certain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that\nmay be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company\u2019s shareholders, as further described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Interests of Meritor\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe covenants in the Merger Agreement prohibiting Parent from soliciting other potential acquisition\nproposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain\nconditions are satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee only if certain conditions are met, as\nfurther described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Parent\nTermination Fee\u201d\u037e\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Company pay the Company Termination Fee, under certain circumstances\nfollowing termination of the Merger Agreement, including if Meritor terminates the Merger Agreement to\naccept a Company Superior Proposal, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement - Company Termination Fee\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the announcement of the Merger Agreement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to\ncomplete the Merger, may cause substantial harm to the Company\u2019s relationships with its employees\n(including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key\nmanagement, technical, sales and other personnel), suppliers and customers and may divert employees\u2019\nattention away from the Company\u2019s day-to-day business operations.\nAfter considering the foregoing factors, the Meritor Board concluded that, overall, the potentially beneficial factors\nrelating to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, outweighed the risks and potentially\nnegative factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meritor Board is not exhaustive but is\nintended to reflect the material factors considered by the Meritor Board in its consideration of the Merger Agreement\nand the Transactions, including the Merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of factors considered, the\nMeritor Board, individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various\nfactors. Rather, the Meritor Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and\nconsidered by it. In addition, individual members of the Meritor Board may have given different weights to different\nfactors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meritor Board is forward-looking in\nnature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under the caption \u201cCautionary Statement\nConcerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nTHE MERITOR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE MERGER PROPOSAL.\nOpinion of Meritor\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter, Meritor retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the\nproposed Merger and to deliver a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Merger. Meritor decided to\nengage J.P. Morgan due to, among other things, its extensive experience in Meritor\u2019s industry, its qualifications and\nits deep expertise in the matters that were to be considered by the Meritor Board.\nAt the meeting of the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board of\nDirectors of Meritor that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions, limitations\nand qualifications set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common\nStock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its\nFebruary 21, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Meritor Board, dated February 21, 2022, that, as\nof such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such shareholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated February 21, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Meritor\u2019s shareholders are urged to\nread the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Meritor Board (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the\nconsideration to be paid to the holders of Common Stock in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the\nMerger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion\ndoes not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Meritor as to how such shareholder should vote with\nrespect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated February 20, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Meritor and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of Meritor with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of Meritor common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of Meritor relating\nto its business, including the Projections\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Meritor with respect to certain\naspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Meritor, the financial condition and future\nprospects and operations of Meritor, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its\ninquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Meritor or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P.\nMorgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,\npursuant to J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement letter with Meritor, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake\nany such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal\nof any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Meritor under any applicable laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or\nderived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the\nbest currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of Meritor to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and\nthe other Transactions will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger\nAgreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also\nassumed that the representations and warranties made by Meritor and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the\nrelated agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to Meritor with respect to such issues. J.P.\nMorgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on Meritor or on the contemplated benefits\nof the Merger.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has\nexpressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of\nany other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Meritor or as to the underlying decision by Meritor\nto engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such\npersons relative to the consideration to be paid to holders of Common Stock in the proposed Merger or with respect\nto the fairness of any such compensation.\nJ.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect\nto the sale of all or any part of Meritor or any other alternative transaction. The terms of the Merger Agreement were\ndetermined through arm\u2019s length negotiations between Meritor and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger\nAgreement was solely that of the Meritor Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the\nmany factors considered by the Meritor Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Meritor Board or management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger\nConsideration.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Meritor Board on February 21, 2022 and in the financial analyses\ncontained in the presentation delivered to the Meritor Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such\nopinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with\nrendering such opinion and contained in such presentation, and does not purport to be a complete description of the\nanalyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.\nConsidering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of Meritor with similar data for\nselected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to Meritor. The\ncompanies selected by J.P. Morgan (the \u201cSelected Companies\u201d) were:\nAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc.\nDana Inc.\nSAF-HOLLAND SE\nModine Manufacturing Co.\nCommercial Vehicle Group, Inc.\nHaldex AB\nThe Selected Companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses\nthat, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of\nMeritor and/or one or more of its businesses. The Selected Companies may be considered similar to Meritor or such\nbusinesses based on the nature of their assets and operations\u037e however, none of the companies selected is identical\nor directly comparable to Meritor or such businesses, and certain of these companies may have characteristics that\nare materially different from those of Meritor or such businesses. J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses necessarily involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect Meritor or such\nbusinesses.\nUsing information obtained from the Selected Companies\u2019 public filings and FactSet Research Systems as of February\n18, 2022, J.P. Morgan calculated for each Selected Company the ratio of such company\u2019s firm value (calculated as the\nmarket value of the company\u2019s common stock on a fully diluted basis, plus any debt and minority interest, less cash\nand cash equivalents) to the equity research analyst estimate for such company\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d), for each of 2022 and 2023, calendarized based on a\nSeptember 30 fiscal year end, which we refer to as FV / 2022E Adjusted EBITDA and FV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA,\nrespectively. For ease of presentation, September 30 is used to represent the Company\u2019s fiscal year end, as the\nCompany\u2019s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. The following table represents the results of this\nanalysis for each of the Selected Companies:\nFV/2022E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nFV/2023E\nAdjusted\nEBITDA\nAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc.\n6.9x\n6.3x\nDana Inc.\n5.8x\n4.9x\nSAF-HOLLAND SE\n5.1x\n4.7x\nModine Manufacturing Co.\n5.4x\n4.8x\nCommercial Vehicle Group, Inc.\n5.2x\n4.8x\nHaldex AB\n4.5x\n4.0x\nCummins (for reference only)\n8.6x\n7.8x\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 4.50x to 7.00x for FV / 2022E\nAdjusted EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 4.00x to 6.50x for FV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJ.P. Morgan applied these ranges to Meritor\u2019s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023 based\non the Projections, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled Certain Meritor Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information, to derive a range of firm values for Meritor, which was then adjusted to take into\naccount Meritor\u2019s net debt and non-controlling interest balance totaling $1,029 million in the aggregate as of\nDecember 31, 2021 to derive a range of implied equity values for Meritor. The analysis indicated the following ranges\nof implied per share equity value for the Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:\nImplied Per Share\nEquity Value\n(rounded to the\nnearest $0.25)\nLow\nHigh\nFV/2022E Adj. EBITDA\n$18.50\n$36.75\nFV/2023E Adj.

Morgan reviewed selected transactions (the \u201cSelected Transactions\u201d)\ninvolving businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis and based on its experience and professional\njudgment, were considered by J.P. Morgan to be similar to Meritor\u2019s business. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the\nSelected Transactions set forth in the below table.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each Selected Transaction, the ratio of the target\ncompany\u2019s firm value implied by the consideration paid in such transaction to the target company\u2019s Adjusted\nEBITDA for the twelve calendar-month period (\u201cLTM\u201d) prior to announcement of the applicable transaction\n(\u201cFV/LTM Adjusted EBITDA\u201d). The following table represents the results of this analysis for each of the Selected\nTransactions:\nTarget\nAcquiror\nMonth/Year\nAnnounced\nFV/LTM\nAdjusted \nEBITDA\nDelphi Technologies PLC\nBorgWarner Inc.\nJanuary 2020\n5.7x\nOC Oerlikon Corporation AG\u2019s Drive\nSystems segment\nDana International Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l.\nJuly 2018\n6.7x\nGrammer AG(1)\nJiye Auto Parts GmbH\nMay 2018\n7.7x\nGKN plc(2)\nMelrose Industries plc\nJanuary 2018\n8.7x\nAccuride Corporation\nCrestview Advisors L.L.C.\nSeptember 2016\n5.7x\nGetrag Group of Companies\nMagna International Inc.\nJuly 2015\n8.8x\nWaupaca Foundry Holdings Inc.\nHitachi Metals Ltd.\nAugust 2014\n5.9x\nWABCO Holdings Inc.

Morgan considered appropriate based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 5.75x to 8.75x for FV/LTM\nAdjusted EBITDA and applied it to Meritor\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, to\nderive a range of firm values for Meritor, which was then adjusted to take into account Meritor\u2019s net debt, non-\ncontrolling interest and receivables factoring balance totaling $1,349 million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2021\nto derive a range of implied equity values for Meritor. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per\nshare of Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $14.75 to $32.00, which was compared to (a) the closing\nprice per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the Merger Consideration of $36.50 per\nshare of Common Stock.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nJ.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity\nvalue per share for the Common Stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using\nestimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value\nof money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their \u201cpresent value.\u201d The \u201cunlevered free cash\nflows,\u201d for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated\nby an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current\nvalue of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the\npresent using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the cost of\ncapital and other appropriate factors. \u201cTerminal value\u201d refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated\nby the asset for periods beyond the projections period.\nJ.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the future standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows for the three\nfiscal quarters ending October 2, 2022 and for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2025 based upon the Projections\n(the \u201cDCF Projection Period\u201d). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Meritor by applying a range\nof perpetuity growth rates, as provided by management of Meritor, ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% of the unlevered free\ncash flows of Meritor during the final year of the DCF Projection Period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range\nof terminal values were then discounted from September 30 of each year to present values as of December 31, 2021\nusing a mid-year convention and a range of discount rates from 9.75% to 10.75%. The discount rate range was\nselected by J.P. Morgan based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for Meritor.\nIn addition, as directed by management of Meritor, J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of certain tax credits\nexpected to be utilized by Meritor through fiscal year 2029, which were discounted from September 30 of each year to\npresent values as of December 31, 2021 using the same mid-year convention and a discount range of 9.75% to\n10.75%. The total tax credit utilization amounts provided by management of Meritor were $28 million for the three\nfiscal quarters ending October 2, 2022, and $32 million, $28 million, $31 million, $29 million, $11 million, $15 million and\n$15 million, for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2029, respectively. The present values were then added together\nwith the present values derived based on the unlevered free cash flows to derive a range of firm values for Meritor,\nwhich was then adjusted to take into account Meritor\u2019s net debt, non-controlling interest and receivables factoring\nbalance totaling $1,349 million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2021 to derive a range of implied equity values for\nMeritor.\nBased on the foregoing, these analyses indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Common Stock,\nrounded to the nearest $0.25, of $28.75 to $38.25. The range of implied equity values per share of Common Stock were\ncompared to (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the Merger\nConsideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.\nOther Information\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan\nreviewed the trading range for the Common Stock for the 52-week period ended February 18, 2022, which was $20.50\nper share to $32.93 per share, and compared that range to (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67\nas of February 18, 2022, and (b) the proposed Merger Consideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.\nAnalyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the\npublicly available equity research analyst price target range for the Common Stock available as of February 18, 2022,\nand noted that such price target range was $26.00 per share to $34.00 per share, and compared that price target range\nto (a) the closing price per share of Common Stock of $24.67 as of February 18, 2022, and (b) the proposed Merger\nConsideration of $36.50 per share of Common Stock.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of the material financial analyses undertaken by J.P. Morgan does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a\ncomplex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbelieves that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of\nthe foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an\nincomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations\nresulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create\npoints of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the\nactual value of Meritor. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to\nthose analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any\nanalyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor\n(positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan\nconsidered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the Selected\nCompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to Meritor, and none of the Selected\nTransactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of Meritor. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants,\nsize and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational\ncharacteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Meritor and\nthe transactions compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Meritor with respect to the Merger\nand deliver an opinion to the Meritor Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such\nexperience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with Meritor and\nthe industries in which it operates.\nJ.P. Morgan received a fee from Meritor of $5.0 million for delivery of its opinion. Meritor has agreed to pay J.P.\nMorgan a transaction fee equal to 1.0% of the Merger Consideration upon the closing of the transaction, against\nwhich the opinion fee will be credited. In addition, Meritor has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable,\ndocumented and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and\ndisbursements of external counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Meritor and Parent for which J.P. Morgan and\nsuch affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as\njoint lead arranger on Parent\u2019s credit facilities, which closed in August 2021, joint lead bookrunner on Meritor\u2019s\nofferings of debt securities, which closed in June 2020 and November 2020, and joint lead active bookrunner on\nParent\u2019s offering of debt securities, which closed in August 2020. During the two year period preceding the delivery\nof its opinion ending on February 21, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Meritor were\napproximately $2.0 million and from Parent were approximately $9.5 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses,\nJ.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Meritor or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of\ncustomers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial\ninstruments.",

        "Section Text": "Certain Meritor Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile Meritor has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Meritor has not, as a matter of\ncourse, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections by year as to future performance, earnings or other results\nbeyond the then current annual period, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to,\namong other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the\nuncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Meritor is including in this\n34TABLE OF CONTENTS\nproxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of Meritor on a standalone\nbasis, without giving effect to the Merger (the \u201cProjections\u201d), prepared by Meritor\u2019s management, solely because\nsuch financial information was given to the Meritor Board and J.P. Morgan as described below. Meritor advised the\nrecipients of the Projections that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many respects, and the inclusion of\nthe Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication of future results or an accurate\nprediction of future results, and should not be relied on as such.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view toward\ncompliance with published guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for\npreparation and presentations of financial projections. This information is prospective and should not be relied upon\nas being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on the Projections. The Projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company\u2019s\nmanagement. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any independent\naccountants, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections and, accordingly,\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered accounting firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance\non the Projections or their achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the\nProjections. Meritor\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report, contained in the Company\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement, relates to Meritor\u2019s historical financial information and does not extend to the Projections and should not\nbe read to do so. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after\nthe date they were prepared.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company\nperformance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and\nother matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties\nand beyond Meritor\u2019s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section \u201cCautionary Statement\nConcerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d could cause the Projections or the underlying assumptions to be\ninaccurate. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections, and accordingly,\nthere can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Meritor\u2019s shareholders are\nurged to review Meritor\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of the reported and anticipated results of\noperations and financial condition and capital resources, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Meritor\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nOctober 3, 2021, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this\nproxy statement.\nThe inclusion of a summary of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that\nany of Meritor, Parent or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives considered\nthe Projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the Projections should not be relied upon as\nsuch nor should the information contained in the Projections be considered appropriate for other purposes. None of\nMeritor, Parent or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any\nassurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections. Meritor undertakes no obligation to\nupdate or otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections\nwere generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions\nunderlying the Projections are shown to be in error.\nThe Company has not made and makes no representation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other person, in the Merger\nAgreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections or regarding Meritor\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the\ninformation contained in the Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Meritor urges all of its\nshareholders to review Meritor\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company\u2019s reported financial\nresults.\nProjections\nThe following is a summary of the unaudited Meritor prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through\n2025 that was prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Projections were prepared by Meritor\u2019s management in\nDecember 2021 and were provided to the Meritor Board in connection with its consideration and evaluation of a\npotential transaction with Parent. The Projections were also provided to J.P Morgan in connection with its financial\nanalysis and opinion, as discussed in the section entitled \u201c- Opinion of Meritor\u2019s Financial\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdvisor.\u201d The Projections are based solely on the information available to Meritor\u2019s management at those times, and\ndo not give effect to the Merger. The summary of the Projections included in this proxy statement are presented to\ngive Meritor shareholders access to the financial projections that were made available to the Meritor Board and J.P\nMorgan. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence your decision,\nif you are a Meritor shareholder, to vote for the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment\nProposal.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Projections, with dollars in millions:\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nRevenue\n$4,237\n$4,496\n$4,580\n$4,950\nAdj.

The Projections also do not take into account any\ncircumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do not give effect to the\nTransactions, including the Merger, and also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be\ncompleted. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a\nresult, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Projections. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected.\nThe inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Meritor\nor its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the Projections to be predictive of actual future events, and\nthe Projections should not be relied on as such. None of Meritor or its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees,\ndirectors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Projections, and\nnone of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections to\nreflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in error. The\nCompany does not intend to publicly update or make any other revision to the Projections. None of Meritor or any of\nits affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to\nParent, Merger Sub or any other person regarding Meritor\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the Projections or\nthat the results reflected therein will be achieved. For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement\nare cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections.\nInterests of Meritor\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Meritor Board to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, Meritor\nshareholders should be aware that Meritor\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of Meritor shareholders generally. The Meritor Board was aware of these\ninterests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in\nreaching its decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and in\nrecommending to Meritor shareholders that the Merger Agreement be approved. Such interests are described below.\nThe Merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of certain Meritor executive compensation and benefit plans\nand agreements described below.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMeritor\u2019s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Chris\nVillavarayan (President and Chief Executive Officer), Carl D. Anderson II (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer), Timothy Bowes (Senior Vice President and President, Electrification, Industrial and North America\nAftermarket), and John Nelligan (Senior Vice President and President, Truck, Americas). Jeffrey A. Craig (former\nExecutive Chairman of the Meritor Board) is not included in the discussion below because his employment with\nMeritor terminated upon his retirement on December 31, 2021 and as such he is not entitled to any of the payments or\nbenefits described below. Likewise, Hannah S. Lim-Johnson (former Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and\nCorporate Secretary) is not included in the discussion below because her employment with Meritor terminated on\nOctober 25, 2021 and as such she is not entitled to any of the payments or benefits described below. Meritor\u2019s\nexecutive officer who is not a named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below is Ken Hogan (Senior\nVice President and President, Truck, Europe and Asia Pacific).\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nthe relevant price per share of Meritor common stock is $36.50, which is the per share merger consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on April 11, 2022, which is the assumed date of the\nEffective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe employment of each executive officer of Meritor was terminated by the surviving corporation without\n\u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the\nrelevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the assumed date\nof the Effective Time of April 11, 2022.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before completion of the Merger.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding Meritor\nequity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:\n\u2022\neach share of Meritor restricted common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time\nwill be fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, with each holder of such shares receiving the\nsame Merger Consideration as all other outstanding shareholders of Meritor common stock at the Effective\nTime\u037e\n\u2022\neach Meritor RSU Award will be converted into a Converted RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective\nTime, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Meritor RSU Award\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, including all service-based vesting conditions\u037e provided that any\naccelerated vesting applicable to such Meritor RSU Award in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination of\nemployment\u201d (as such term is defined in the applicable Meritor long-term incentive plan, and set forth\nbelow) occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such Converted RSU Award\u037e\nand\n\u2022\neach Meritor PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) scheduled to\nvest on or prior to September 30, 2024 will fully vest and be canceled and converted into the right to receive\nan amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common\nStock subject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable taxes\nand (ii) scheduled to vest after September 30, 2024 will be converted into the right to receive an amount in\ncash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock\nsubject to such Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the same terms and\nconditions as applied to the corresponding Meritor PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nincluding all service-based vesting conditions\u037e provided that any accelerated vesting applicable to such\nMeritor PSU Award in the event of a qualifying termination\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof employment occurring after the closing date shall apply for the remaining term of such Converted PSU\nAward. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Meritor PSU\nAward with a performance period that is incomplete (or that is complete but for which performance is not\ndeterminable due to the unavailability of the required data for relative measures) as of the Effective Time\nwill be determined by deeming the performance goals applicable to such Meritor PSU Award to be achieved\nat the target level of performance.\nIn the case of any Meritor Equity Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, all payments with respect to\nsuch Meritor Equity Award shall be made in accordance with and at the earliest time as is consistent with the\nrequirements of Section 409A of the Code, and Meritor Equity Awards may be treated in an alternate method to the\nextent required by law or agreed by the Parties.\nFor purposes of the Meritor Equity Awards and the officer employment agreements described below, the term\n\u201cqualifying termination of employment\u201d means a termination of the employee's employment by Meritor without\n\u201ccause\u201d (defined as any act of fraud or intentional misrepresentation or embezzlement, misappropriation or\nconversion of assets of Meritor or any affiliate, or the intentional and repeated violation of the written policies or\nprocedures of Meritor), due to the employee's death, retirement or disability, or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(defined as the occurrence of any of the following events without the employee\u2019s written consent: (i) a material\ndiminution in the employee\u2019s base salary\u037e (ii) a relocation of the employee\u2019s principal place of employment by more\nthan 50 miles\u037e (iii) any material breach by Meritor of any material provision of the applicable Meritor long-term\nincentive plan\u037e or (iv) a material diminution in the employee\u2019s authority, duties or responsibilities).\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d for an estimate of the value of each of Meritor\u2019s\nnamed executive officer\u2019s unvested Meritor equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above under \u201c-\nCertain Assumptions\u201d, the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the Effective Time to\nMeritor\u2019s executive officer who is not a named executive officer in respect of his unvested Meritor equity awards\ngranted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement is as follows: unvested Meritor RSU Awards-$1,158,729.00\u037e\nunvested Meritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest on or prior to September 30, 2024-$592,833.00\u037e and unvested\nMeritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest after September 30, 2024-$597,651.00 (based on the achievement of target\nperformance). As of the assumed effective date of April 11, 2022, 16,374 Meritor PSU Awards scheduled to vest after\nSeptember 30, 2024 were held by such executive officers. Shares of Meritor restricted common stock held by\nMeritor\u2019s non-employee directors vest on the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of their grant date or the date\nthe director resigns or ceases to serve on the board in accordance with the director compensation policy.\nOfficer Employment Agreements\nEach Meritor executive officer has entered into an employment agreement with Meritor that provides that, in the\nevent that the officer\u2019s employment with Meritor is terminated within two years following a change in control of\nMeritor by Meritor as a result of a qualifying termination of employment (as defined above), then Meritor will be\nobligated to pay the officer (a) any accrued and unpaid salary and vacation through the executive\u2019s date of\nseparation from service (as such term is defined in the applicable agreement) paid in lump sum within thirty calendar\ndays of said separation or earlier as may be required by law, (b) the officer\u2019s then-current annual base salary, payable\nratably in equal semi-monthly installments over a period of 18 months (the \u201cSeverance Period\u201d), (c) the full target\namount of the officer\u2019s annual bonus under the Meritor annual incentive compensation plan for the year in which the\ntermination occurs, paid out in a lump sum within 30 days after the qualifying termination of employment, (d)\ncontinuation of health coverage (other than accidental death and dismemberment and long-term and short-term\ndisability coverage) throughout the Severance Period (or until the executive becomes subsequently employed and\ncovered by the health plan of the new employer), (e) continued life insurance coverage through the end of the\nSeverance Period, and (f) reasonable outplacement services for twelve months, the cost of which may not exceed\n$10,000. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the employment agreements of (i)\nMeritor\u2019s named executive officers, and (ii) Meritor\u2019s executive officer who is not a named executive officer for\npurposes of this section, may be extended on the same terms and conditions for an additional one-year period from\nDecember 1, 2022 to December 1, 2023, consistent with past practice but in any event before closing.\nThe executive officer employment agreements provide that, if the compensation and benefits payable to the officer\nwould be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such amounts will either be paid in\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfull or reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the executive officer\nin a better after-tax position.\nPursuant to the terms of each executive officer employment agreement, each executive officer is subject to a\nnoncompetition covenant that applies during employment and for a period of 18 months following termination of\nemployment for any reason, and a nonsolicitation covenant that applies during employment and for a period of 12\nmonths following termination of employment for any reason.\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d for the estimated amounts that each of Meritor\u2019s\nnamed executive officers would receive under their employment agreements upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment following a change in control of Meritor. Based on the assumptions described above under \u201c-Certain\nAssumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance payments (including a target annual cash\nincentive award) that Meritor\u2019s executive officer who is not a named executive officer would receive under his\nemployment agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control of Meritor is\n$1,037,484.\nTransaction Bonus Awards\nIn connection with the Merger, Meritor intends to establish a cash transaction bonus program for executive officers\nnot to exceed $13 million in the aggregate, to be allocated by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Bonuses\nunder this program will be paid 50% on the closing date and the remaining 50% will be paid on the first paycheck after\nthe 90th day following the closing date (the \u201cRetention Date\u201d). If the executive officer experiences a qualifying\ntermination of employment after the closing date and before the Retention Date, the remaining 50% of the transaction\nbonus will be paid to such executive officer. The executive officer forfeits the right to any and all unpaid portions of\nthe transaction bonus if their employment is terminated prior to the closing date. The transaction bonus program is\nintended to reward certain executives of Meritor for the focus and resources they provided with respect to the\nMerger, driving operational excellence and results and assist in retaining key employees through the closing of the\nMerger. Each executive officer is eligible to receive awards under such program, but the recipients of such awards\nand their respective award amounts, if any, have not yet been determined.\nTreatment of Cash Incentive Compensation Plan Awards\nUnder the terms of the Meritor Incentive Compensation Plan and its sub-plans (the \u201cICP\u201d) and the Merger\nAgreement: (a) if the closing occurs before the end of fiscal year 2022, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee\nwho is eligible to participate in the ICP, including each executive officer, the full incentive amounts payable for fiscal\nyear 2022 with such amounts determined based on the greater of actual or target performance\u037e (b) if the closing\noccurs after the end of fiscal year 2022 but before the date incentive amounts would otherwise be paid under the ICP\nin the ordinary course, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee who is eligible to participate in the ICP,\nincluding each executive officer, accelerated payment of such bonus amounts based on actual performance\u037e and (c) if\nthe closing occurs during fiscal year 2023, Meritor may provide to each Meritor employee who is eligible to\nparticipate in the ICP, including each executive officer, a prorated portion of the annual incentive under the ICP with\nrespect to the portion of the year of the closing that occurs prior to the closing, which bonus will be determined\nbased on target performance (provided that any executive officer who is entitled to a full target bonus upon a\nqualifying termination pursuant to an employment agreement will not receive a duplicate payment under the ICP).\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Meritor\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Transaction\u201d for the estimated amount of the ICP payment that\neach of Meritor\u2019s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the merger agreement.\nBased on the assumptions described above under \u201c-Certain Assumptions\u201d, the estimated aggregate \u201csingle trigger\u201d\namount of the ICP payments (for purposes of this quantification assuming target performance and that the closing\noccurs on or prior to the last day of fiscal year 2022) that Meritor\u2019s executive officer who is not a named executive\nofficer would receive under the ICP is $301,275.\n2023 Annual Equity Award Grants\nMeritor and Parent have agreed that, if the closing occurs after November 15, 2022, Meritor may grant 2023 annual\nequity awards to Meritor\u2019s executive officers under the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with the grant date fair value of such awards not to exceed $16 million, provided that such\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nawards cannot provide for vesting at closing and will be converted into restricted cash awards at closing (with PSUs\nconverting into time-vesting awards based on target performance), but can provide for accelerated vesting on a\nqualifying termination of employment any time after the closing.\nIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Meritor\u2019s non-employee directors and executive officers will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies\nfollowing the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nQuantification Of Potential Payments And Benefits To Meritor\u2019s Named Executive Officers In Connection\nWith The Transaction\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which\nrequires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Meritor that is\nbased on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits\ndescribed below, see the discussion under the caption \u201cInterests of Meritor\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d above.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger. The ultimate\nvalues to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set\nforth below. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of Meritor common stock is $36.50, which is the per share merger\nconsideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe effective time as referenced in this section occurs on April 11, 2022, which is the assumed date of the\neffective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each named executive officer of Meritor was terminated by the surviving corporation\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or due to the officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the\nrelevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the effective time and on the assumed\ndate of the effective time of April 11, 2022.\nNamed Executive Officer(1)\nCash \n($)(1)\nEquity\n($)(2)\nPerquisites\n/ \nBenefits\n($)(3)\nTax \nReimbursement\n($)\nTotal ($)\nChris Villavarayan\n2,503,930\n15,766,649\n16,194\n-\n18,286,774\nCarl D.

This\ndiscussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders.\nThis discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the\n\u201cCode\u201d), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions and administrative rulings\nand published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (referred to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), each as in effect as of the date\nhereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any\nsuch change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this\ndiscussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis\nof all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the\nunearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or\nthe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and\nintergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith), nor does it address any\nconsiderations under state, local or foreign tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal\nincome tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, the conclusions set forth in this\ndiscussion could be subject to challenge, which challenge could be sustained.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\na citizen or resident individual of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s\nadministration, and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust,\nor (ii) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a\nU.S. person\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Common Stock who hold such shares as a capital asset\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndiscussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S.\nholder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under\nU.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign\ncurrencies, traders in securities who elect to apply the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the\nalternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt\norganizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain former\ncitizens or former long-term residents of the United States, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in such\npartnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment\ncompanies, U.S. holders who hold shares of Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,\nconversion or other integrated transaction, a holder required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross\nincome with respect to shares of Common Stock as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable\nfinancial statement, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of Common Stock through the exercise of employee\nstock options or other compensation arrangements).\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes) holds shares of Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend\non the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a\npartner in a partnership holding shares of Common Stock, you should consult your tax advisor.\nThis discussion of material U.S. federal tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax\nadvice. Holders of Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the\nunearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, state, local, foreign income or other tax\nlaws.\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who\nreceives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in its shares of Common Stock.\nAny such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Common\nStock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of\ncertain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential\nrates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common\nStock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period\nseparately with respect to each block of Common Stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain\ncircumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup\nwithholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the\napplicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury\nthat such U.S. holder is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification\nnumber provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded by the IRS or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder\nfurnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nRegulatory Approvals\nAntitrust Clearance. Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the\nMerger, may not be completed until certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR\nAct requires that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the United States Federal Trade Commission (the\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cFTC\u201d). A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar\nwaiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of\nthat waiting period. In certain circumstances the review period may be extended by either the parties or the Antitrust\nDivision or FTC. Completion of the Merger is conditioned on the expiration or early termination of the applicable\nwaiting period under the HSR Act, and the receipt of certain approvals under the competition laws of certain\nspecified jurisdictions and the investment laws of certain specified jurisdictions. The Company and Parent filed their\nrespective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on March 7, 2022. The applicable\nwaiting period under the HSR Act expired on April 6, 2022.\nAt any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division\nor the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to\nrescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or other\nremedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the\nantitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to\nenjoin the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may\nalso seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a\nchallenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be\nsuccessful.\nCommitments to Obtain Antitrust Approval.

On March 22, 2022, a purported Meritor shareholder filed a lawsuit against\nMeritor and the current members of the Meritor Board alleging that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Meritor in\nconnection with the Merger contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in violation of federal law.\nThe lawsuit is captioned O\u2019Dell v. Meritor, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02322, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York. On March 24, 2022, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants\nasserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Whitfield v. Meritor, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01636, and is pending in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In addition, on March 31, 2022, another lawsuit was filed\nagainst the same defendants, also asserting similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Fitzurka v. Meritor, Inc., et al.,\nNo. 1:22-cv-011793, and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Also on March 31,\n2022, counsel for Shiva Stein, a purported Meritor shareholder, sent a demand letter including similar allegations\nagainst Meritor and the current members of the Meritor Board.\nThe complaints and demand letter generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Meritor in connection\nwith the Merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the\nExchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections\nof Meritor, (ii) certain financial analyses of Meritor\u2019s financial advisor, (iii) the financial benefits to Meritor executives\nand members of the Meritor Board from the Merger, and (iv) certain statements concerning the sale process. Plaintiffs\ngenerally seek, among other things, to enjoin Meritor from consummating the Merger, or in the alternative, rescission\nof the Merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees.\nMeritor believes that the allegations in the complaints and demand letter are without merit. Additional lawsuits and\ndemand letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or sent in the future.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as\nAnnex A to this proxy statement.
