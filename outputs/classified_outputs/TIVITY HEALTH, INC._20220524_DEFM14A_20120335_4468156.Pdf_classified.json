Specifically, the Complaints allege that the preliminary\nproxy statement filed by Tivity Health with the SEC on May 10, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains\nmaterially incomplete and misleading information concerning the Company\u2019s financial projections and the financial\nanalyses conducted by Lazard in support of its fairness opinion.

Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers.

        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the\nMerger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions\nthat may be important to you as a Tivity Health stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we\nrefer to in this Proxy Statement.

The Board is furnishing this Proxy Statement and form of proxy card to the\nholders of Tivity Health Common Stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to\nprovide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting on the matters presented at the\nSpecial Meeting. Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 may attend\nthe Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Special Meeting will be held at Tivity Health\u2019s headquarters located at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin,\nTennessee, 37067, on June 23, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Tivity Health?\nA:\nThe proposed Merger is the acquisition of Tivity Health by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and\ninto Tivity Health pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is\napproved by the requisite number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, and the other closing conditions\nunder the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Tivity Health,\nwith Tivity Health continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Tivity Health will become\na direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nTivity Health expects to delist its common stock from Nasdaq and de-register its common stock under the\nExchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Tivity Health would no longer be a\npublicly traded company, and Tivity Health will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nUpon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 in\ncash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Tivity Health Common Stock\nthat you own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the\nDGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, you will\nbe entitled to receive $3,250.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange\nfor your 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not\nown nor be entitled to acquire shares in the Surviving Corporation or Parent.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nOnly stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 are entitled to notice of the Special\nMeeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other\n15TABLE OF CONTENTS\nnominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are \u201cnon-routine\nmatters,\u201d your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the\nSpecial Meeting Proposals.

The governing documents of the 401(k) Plan require Fidelity, as trustee, to vote the shares as\ndirected by the plan participants for whose benefit the shares are held. Fidelity will use an independent third\nparty to tabulate the voting directions of all participants who provide such directions to Fidelity. Neither the\ntabulator nor Fidelity will provide the individual participant voting directions to Tivity Health, unless otherwise\nrequired by law.

This will include an\naffidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to\npost a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for\nany other reason, Tivity Health stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock. Instead, Tivity Health will remain an independent public company, Tivity Health Common Stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to\nfile periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity Health Common Stock.\nUnder certain specified circumstances in which the Merger is not consummated, Tivity Health may be required\nto pay Parent a termination fee, or under certain other specified circumstances, Tivity Health may be entitled to\nreceive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the\nsections entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 88 of this Proxy\nStatement.\nQ:\nDo any of Tivity Health\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ\nfrom those of Tivity Health stockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that Tivity Health\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nMerger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Tivity Health stockholders generally. The Board was\naware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Tivity Health stockholders. For a\ndescription of the interests of Tivity Health\u2019s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 56 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain\ncompensation arrangements for Tivity Health\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger, commonly referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote\nthereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting\npower of the Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at\nthe Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve: (i) by means of a non-binding,\nadvisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (ii) the proposal to approve one or more\nadjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. This means that the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater\nthan 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by\ntelephone, submit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to\napprove compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger or the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from\ntime to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions will be counted as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity\nHealth to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve one or more\nadjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Because all of the proposals\npresented to stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the\nSpecial Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and\nwill not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of May 23, 2022, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there were\napproximately 49,932,432 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding.

In that case, this Proxy Statement has been\nforwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be\nthe stockholder of record.

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health\nstockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other\ntransaction acceptable to Tivity Health will be offered or that Tivity Health\u2019s business, prospects or results of\noperation will not be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, under specified circumstances, Tivity Health may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be\nentitled to receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described\nin the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 88 of this Proxy\nStatement.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTransaction Consideration\nUpon the consummation of the Merger, each share of Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares held by Tivity Health or any subsidiary of Tivity Health\n(including shares held as treasury stock), (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub, which will be\ncancelled for no consideration, and (iii) any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive Transaction\nConsideration.",

        "Section Text": "Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board that holders of Tivity Health Common Stock vote to approve the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, our stockholders should be aware that certain of Tivity Health\u2019s executive\nofficers and non-employee directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those\nof Tivity Health\u2019s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other\nmatters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that Tivity Health stockholders\napprove the adoption of the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the discussion below, Tivity Health\u2019s executive\nofficers (each of whom is a named executive officer) are Richard M. Ashworth (Chief Executive Officer), Adam C.\nHolland (Chief Financial Officer), Ryan M. Wagers (Chief Accounting Officer), Thomas E. Lewis (Chief Operating\nOfficer), and J. Raymond Bilbao (Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary) (each, a \u201cNEO\u201d). These interests are\ndescribed below.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time is May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for\npurposes of the disclosure in this section (the \u201cChange in Control Date\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Tivity Health is assumed to be terminated by Tivity Health\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined\nin the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date\u037e\n\u2022\nThe potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a \u201ccutback\u201d to\navoid the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\nA price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $32.50, which is equal to the Transaction Consideration\npayable in the Merger.\nAs the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or\nbe accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially\ndiffer from the amounts set forth below.\nTreatment and Quantification of Tivity Health Equity Awards\nTreatment of Company Options\nEach Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and will entitle the holder, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and\n(ii) the Surviving Corporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, to receive an amount in cash (without\ninterest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the\nnumber of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOption as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction Consideration over\nthe exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior\nto the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of a Company Option is equal to\nor greater than the Transaction Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger\nwithout any action on the part of, and without any payment to, the Company Option holder.\nTreatment of Company MSUs\nEach Company MSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, as of the date of this\nProxy Statement, consists only of Company MSU awards held by Mr. Ashworth) will automatically become vested,\nwill be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, and will entitle the holder to\nreceive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving\nCorporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable\nwithholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health\nCommon Stock that would have vested pursuant to the terms of such Company MSU award based on actual\nperformance through the Effective Time, and (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent that any Company\nMSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such\ncash payment will be paid in accordance with the Company MSU award\u2019s terms and at the earliest time permitted\nunder the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the\nCode.\nTreatment of Company RSUs\nExcept as described below for Company RSU awards granted after April 5, 2022, each Company RSU award\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully vested, will be cancelled and\nwill entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii)\nthe Surviving Corporation\u2019s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject\nto applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time\nand (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent a Company RSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred\ncompensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such cash payment will be paid in accordance with the\nCompany RSU award\u2019s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in\nthe application of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code.\nTreatment of Company RSUs Granted After April 5, 2022\nIf the Merger is completed, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors under\nTivity Health\u2019s Director Deferred Compensation Program and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs (that\nare not applicable to any of Tivity Health\u2019s NEOs or non-employee directors), which, in each case, will vest in full\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award granted after April 5, 2022, will vest immediately\nprior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such proration based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the\nnumber of days of continuous service provided by the grantee to Tivity Health between the grant date of the\nCompany RSU award and the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is 1,096, and otherwise will be treated in\naccordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described above. The portion of any such Company RSU\naward granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will be\nforfeited without consideration upon the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder of any such\nCompany RSU award. No Company RSU awards have been granted to Tivity Health\u2019s named executive officers since\nApril 5, 2022.\nQuantification of Tivity Health Equity Awards\nSee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger-\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the\namounts that would become payable to each Tivity Health named executive officer in respect of his unvested\nCompany Options, Company MSUs and Company RSUs, as applicable.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the assumptions described above under \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of\nTivity Health in the Merger-Certain Assumptions\u201d beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement, the estimated\naggregate amounts that would become payable to Tivity Health\u2019s non-employee directors (including two former non-\nemployee directors whose service on the Board ended on May 20, 2021) in respect of their unvested Tivity Health\nequity awards is $1,277,110 (of which approximately $984,000 pertains to unvested equity awards that are scheduled\nto vest on May 20, 2022). Although Peter Hudson, M.D. and Benjamin Kirshner are considered directors for purposes\nof this disclosure, both Dr. Hudson and Mr. Kirshner departed the Board on May 20, 2021, do not hold any unvested\nCompany RSUs and do not otherwise have any interests in the Merger except insofar as they may hold shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock.\nAgreements with Tivity Health Named Executive Officers\nMessrs. Ashworth and Holland are currently employed pursuant to written employment agreements with Tivity\nHealth effective on the following dates:\n\u2022\nMr. Ashworth - May 20, 2020\n\u2022\nMr. Holland - May 22, 2017\nCollectively, the employment agreements with Messrs. Ashworth and Holland are referred to as the \u201cNEO\nEmployment Agreements\u201d. The employment of each of Messrs. Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers is subject to an offer of\nemployment letter executed on the following dates (the \u201cNEO Offer Letters\u201d), is not subject to a stated term and\nconstitutes at-will employment:\n\u2022\nMr. Bilbao - October 30, 2020\n\u2022\nMr. Lewis - October 4, 2018 (and subsequent amendments dated April 1, 2019 and October 30, 2020)\n\u2022\nMr. Wagers - September 14, 2018\nIn addition to his NEO Offer Letter, Mr. Bilbao is party to a Change of Control Agreement between Tivity Health and\nMr. Bilbao dated as of July 3, 2018 (the \u201cBilbao Change of Control Agreement\u201d). However, Mr. Bilbao would currently\nnot receive severance payments under the Bilbao Change of Control Agreement upon a qualifying termination\nbecause Mr. Bilbao would be entitled to receive more favorable severance benefits under the Separation Benefits\nProgram (as defined below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of\nTivity Health in the Merger- Section 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program\u201d beginning on page 59 of this Proxy\nStatement).\nThe NEO Employment Agreements and NEO Offer Letters (other than with respect to Mr. Bilbao) provide that if the\nemployment of the named executive officer is terminated by Tivity Health without \u201cCause\u201d or by the named executive\nofficer for \u201cGood Reason\u201d (each, as defined in the applicable arrangement) within 12 months following a change in\ncontrol (which would include the Merger), then the NEO would be entitled to the following payments:\n\u2022\nMr. Ashworth - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of termination, payable in a\nlump sum within 30 days of the date of termination\u037e (ii) any earned, but unpaid, bonus, payable in a lump\nsum no later than 30 days following the date of termination\u037e (iii) a pro rata portion of any annual bonus for\nthe year in which the date of termination occurs, based on the greater of target or actual Tivity Health\nperformance, which pro rata annual bonus amount will be determined after the end of the fiscal year for\nwhich the applicable bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan\u037e\n(iv) an amount equal to the sum of (a) Mr. Ashworth\u2019s base salary for a total of thirty (30) months following\nthe date of termination, and (b) Mr. Ashworth\u2019s bonus in respect of the greater of (x) the year prior to the\noccurrence of the Effective Date and (y) the year in which the date of termination occurs, payable in a lump\nsum no later than 30 days following the date of termination\u037e and (v) an amount equal to Tivity Health\u2019s\nestimated obligation for its share of the cost of premiums, and related administrative fees, for group\nmedical, dental and vision continuation coverage for a period equal to 24 months, payable in a lump sum no\nlater than 30 days following the date of termination.\n\u2022\nMr. Holland - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of termination, payable in a\nlump sum no later than 60 days following the date of termination\u037e (ii) a pro rata portion of any annual bonus\nfor the year in which the date of termination occurs, based on actual Tivity Health\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperformance, which pro rata annual bonus amount will be determined after the end of the fiscal year for\nwhich the bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan\u037e (iii) an\namount equal to Mr. Holland\u2019s base salary for a total of one year following the date of termination, payable\nin a lump sum no later than 60 days following the date of termination\u037e and (iv) group medical benefits for\none year after the date of termination, payable in installment payments.\n\u2022\nMessrs. Lewis and Wagers - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of\ntermination, payable in a lump sum within 30 days of the date of termination\u037e (ii) an amount equal to the\nNEO\u2019s base salary for a total of one year following the date of termination, payable in installment payments\u037e\nand (iii) group medical benefits for one year after the date of termination, payable in installment payments.\nIn February 2022, Tivity Health entered into a Special Incentive Bonus Award Agreement (the \u201cSpecial Incentive\nBonus Award Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Ashworth, Tivity Health\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which Mr.\nAshworth will be eligible to receive a cash payment in the amount of $5,000,000 (the \u201cSpecial Incentive Bonus\nAward\u201d) on February 11, 2027 (the \u201cVesting Date\u201d), as long as Mr. Ashworth is serving as an employee of Tivity\nHealth on the Vesting Date, or on such earlier date as Mr. Ashworth\u2019s employment is terminated by Tivity Health\nwithout \u201cCause\u201d, Mr. Ashworth resigns for \u201cGood Reason\u201d (each, as defined in the Special Incentive Bonus Award\nAgreement), or Mr. Ashworth\u2019s employment terminated due to his death or disability. The Special Incentive Bonus\nAward Agreement provides that in the event of a change in control (which would include the Merger), the Special\nIncentive Bonus Award will vest as follows: (a) 50% of the Special Incentive Bonus Award will vest immediately on\nthe date of the change in control, and (b) 50% of the Special Incentive Bonus Award will vest on the first anniversary\nof the date of the change in control, provided Mr. Ashworth has remained in the continuous employment of Tivity\nHealth or its successor through the applicable vesting date (subject to the termination provisions described in the\nprevious sentence). Mr. Ashworth\u2019s receipt of the Special Incentive Bonus Award is subject to his continued\ncompliance with the restrictive covenants contained in his NEO Employment Agreement (as described below).\nFor additional detail, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of\nTivity Health in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.\nUnder the NEO Employment Agreements and NEO Offer Letters, each of the named executive officers is subject to\nrestrictions relating to the use of confidential information, competing against Tivity Health and soliciting any\ncustomers or employees of Tivity Health during the term of employment and for a period up to 24 months thereafter\n(in the case of Mr. Ashworth) or 12 months thereafter (in the case of Messrs. Holland, Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers).\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above are generally conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s\nexecution of a release of claims against Tivity Health.\nSection 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program\nIn September 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted a separation benefits program (the\n\u201cSeparation Benefits Program\u201d) applicable to Tivity Health\u2019s Section 16 officers, which includes each of its named\nexecutive officers. However, Tivity Health\u2019s Section 16 Officers are not entitled to participate in the Separation\nBenefits Program to the extent they are entitled to any severance payments or benefits from another program or\nagreement with Tivity Health (for example, an employment agreement or severance agreement) that provides greater\nseverance payments or more favorable terms than the Separation Benefits Program. Currently, Mr. Bilbao is the only\nNEO entitled to participate in the Separation Benefits Program because the Bilbao Change of Control Agreement with\nthe Company provides for less favorable severance payments than would be payable to him under the Separation\nBenefits Program. If the employment of Mr. Bilbao is terminated by Tivity Health without \u201cCause\u201d or by Mr. Bilbao for\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d (each, as defined in the Separation Benefits Program) within 12 months following a change in control,\nhe would be entitled to the following payments:\n\u2022\nA severance payment in the form of salary continuation for 52 weeks after the date of termination\u037e\n\u2022\nThree months of outplacement services\u037e and\n\u2022\nA subsidy such that Mr. Bilbao\u2019s portion of the COBRA premiums for 52 weeks after the date of termination\nwill approximate the regular colleague contribution for the coverages elected by Mr. Bilbao.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor additional detail, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of\nTivity Health in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.\nThe provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon Mr. Bilbao\u2019s timely execution (without\nrevocation) of a separation agreement and general release of liability against Tivity Health.\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\nAs of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of Tivity Health\u2019s executive officers or non-employee directors have\ndiscussed or entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to\npurchase or participate in the equity plans or arrangements of, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of\ntheir affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, some or all of Tivity Health\u2019s executive\nofficers and non-employee directors may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent regarding employment with, or\nthe right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates (including the Surviving\nCorporation).\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the\ncompensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each named\nexecutive officer of Tivity Health in connection with the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the\npayments and benefits described below, see the discussion under \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and\nExecutive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement, which is\nincorporated herein.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, including\nany equity award grants that may be made after the assumed Effective Time of May 18, 2022. For purposes of\nquantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time is May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for\npurposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Tivity Health is assumed to be terminated by Tivity Health\nwithout \u201cCause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cGood Reason\u201d (as such terms are defined\nin the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a \u201ccutback\u201d to\navoid the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\nA price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $32.50, which is equal to the Transaction Consideration\npayable in the Merger.\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of this disclosure, Tivity Health\u2019s named executive officers are: (i) Richard Ashworth, President and\nChief Executive Officer\u037e (ii) Adam Holland, Chief Financial Officer\u037e (iii) Raymond Bilbao, Chief Legal Officer &\nCorporate Secretary\u037e (iv) Thomas Lewis, Chief Operating Officer\u037e and (v) Ryan Wagers, Chief Accounting Officer.\nThe amounts in the table below assume each NEO has executed and not revoked a full release of claims in favor of\nTivity Health.\nNamed Executive Officer\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nPerquisites\n/ \nBenefits ($)\n(3)\nTotal(4)\nRichard Ashworth\n$8,627,168\n$22,603,053\n$25,143\n$31,255,364\nAdam Holland\n$519,847\n$1,698,245\n$14,794\n$2,232,886\nRaymond Bilbao\n$330,000\n$673,699\n$12,886\n$1,016,585\nThomas Lewis\n$445,000\n$1,173,036\n$15,394\n$1,633,430\nRyan Wagers\n$310,500\n$472,500\n$14,794\n$797,794\n(1)\nCash.

In the case of 50% of Mr. Ashworth\u2019s Special Incentive Bonus Award (i.e.,\n$2,500,000), such amount constitutes a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payment, which means that the amount is payable upon consummation\nof the Merger notwithstanding whether Mr. Ashworth incurs a termination of employment.

Represents Tivity Health\u2019s portion of premiums for group medical benefits to be paid for 12 months\nfollowing the NEO\u2019s termination, except that in the case of Mr. Ashworth, this amount represents 24 months of Tivity Health\u2019s\nestimated portion of premiums for group medical benefits, payable in a lump sum no later than 30 days following the date of\ntermination. The continued group medical benefits coverage or cash payment in respect of group medical premiums, as\napplicable, is a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payment, which means that the amounts will become payable only on a qualifying termination of\nemployment within 12 months following the Merger.\n(4)\nThe potential payments and benefits described in this table are subject to a \u201ccutback\u201d to avoid the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax\nthat may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. While it is possible that this \u201ccutback\u201d provision may apply to a portion\nof the payments that Mr. Ashworth is otherwise entitled to receive, this table assumes that no such \u201ccutback\u201d will apply in order\nto present the maximum amount of payments that Mr. Ashworth could receive if the Section 280G provisions were not to apply\nto all of Mr. Ashworth\u2019s payments described herein. It is not presently anticipated that the other NEOs would be subject to this\n\u201ccutback\u201d provision.\n(5)\nThe Company MSUs are calculated based on the trading volume weighted average price of Tivity Health Common Stock over the\nperiod of 20 consecutive trading days ending on May 18, 2022 of $31.98, which results in 345,479 shares being earned compared\nto the target shares of 150,000.",

Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-03832 (referred to as the\n\u201cStein Complaint\u201d), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the Board. On May 20, 2022, a purported\nstockholder of Tivity Health filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,\ncaptioned Hopkins v. Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02992 (referred to as the \u201cHopkins Complaint\u201d, and,\ncollectively with the Stein Complaint, the \u201cComplaints\u201d), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the\nBoard.\nThe Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the Complaints allege that the preliminary\nproxy statement filed by Tivity Health with the SEC on May 10, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains\nmaterially incomplete and misleading information concerning the Company\u2019s financial projections and the financial\nanalyses conducted by Lazard in support of its fairness opinion. The relief sought in the Complaints includes\nenjoining the consummation and closing of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly\nmaterial information\u037e rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms\nthereof\u037e granting rescissory damages\u037e directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result\nof the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing\u037e and awarding the plaintiffs\u2019 costs and disbursements, including reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nTivity Health believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and Tivity Health and the\nindividual defendants intend to defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Tivity Health cannot predict the amount of\ntime and expense that will be required to resolve either or both of the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nAdditional lawsuits may be filed against Tivity Health or its directors and officers in connection with the Merger. The\noutcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no order,\njudgment, or injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, by any court or other tribunal of competent\njurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect, and no law has been adopted or is effective, in each case\nthat restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff\nwere successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms,\nthen such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected time frame, or at all.",

        "Section Text": "Filing a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of\nTivity Health Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262\nmay commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nSurviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of\nthe shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or\nby a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for appraisal. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should not\nassume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nshares of Tivity Health Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders of Tivity Health Common Stock who desire to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for\nappraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If no petition is filed with the Court of\nChancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, Tivity Health stockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal will cease, and all\nholders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock will be entitled to receive the Transaction Consideration.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who has complied with\nthe requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by\na nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation\na statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect\nto which Tivity Health received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Tivity Health\nCommon Stock. The Surviving Corporation must send this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days\nafter receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and a copy thereof is\nserved upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such\nservice to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery (the \u201cRegister in Chancery\u201d) a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares\n97TABLE OF CONTENTS\nand with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as\nrequired by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The\nCourt of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nstockholder.",

        "Section Header": "Determination of Fair Value",
        "Section Text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will\nappraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware\nstated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which\nrather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to\nthe Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not\nin any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Tivity Health believes that the\nTransaction Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a\ndetermination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Transaction Consideration. Neither Tivity Health\nnor Parent anticipates offering more than the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration to any Tivity Health\nstockholder exercising appraisal rights. Each of Tivity Health and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Tivity Health Common Stock is less than\nthe $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective\nTime through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between\nthe Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving Corporation may, at any time\nbefore the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that\nequals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless\npaid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to\nsuch entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\nalso order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata\nagainst the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each\nparty bears its own expense.\n98TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Tivity Health Common Stock under Section 262\nfails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Tivity\nHealth Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the Transaction\nConsideration, less applicable withholding taxes.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Tivity\nHealth Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, if any, payable to Tivity\nHealth stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Tivity Health stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is\nencouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n99\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

The name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.\nARTICLE THREE\nThe purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized\nunder the General Corporation Law of Delaware.\nARTICLE FOUR\nThe total number of shares which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is one hundred (100) shares, all of\nwhich shall be shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nARTICLE FIVE\nThe directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws, except as may be otherwise be provided in the\nBylaws.\nARTICLE SIX\nThe Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware.\nARTICLE SEVEN\nSection 1.\u2003Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is\ninvolved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a\n\u201cproceeding\u201d), by reason of the fact that he (or a person of whom he is the legal representative), is or was a director\nor officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,\nfiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service\nwith respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity\nas a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,\nemployee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent which it\nis empowered to do so by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter\nbe amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the\nCorporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to\nsuch amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys\u2019 fees actually and reasonably incurred by\nsuch person in connection with such proceeding and such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her\nheirs, executors and administrators\u037e provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article Seven, the\nCorporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding initiated by\nsuch person only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to\nindemnification conferred in this Article Seven shall be a contract right and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this Article\nSeven, shall include the\nA-68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nright to payment by the Corporation of the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its\nfinal disposition. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and\nagents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.\nSection 2.\u2003Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any indemnification of a director or officer of the\nCorporation under Section 1 of this Article Seven or advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article Seven shall\nbe made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a\ndetermination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article\nSeven is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the\nCorporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for\nindemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not\nmade within 30 days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article Seven shall be enforceable\nby the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person\u2019s costs and expenses incurred in\nconnection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall\nalso be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to\nenforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the\nrequired undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of\nconduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to\nindemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither\nthe failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to\nhave made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in\nthe circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation\nLaw of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,\nindependent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,\nshall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of\nconduct.\nSection 3.\u2003Nonexclusively of Article Seven. The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in\ndefending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article Seven shall not be exclusive of\nany other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of\nincorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\nSection 4.\u2003Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any\nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request\nof the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,\nwhether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this\nArticle Seven.\nSection 5.\u2003Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of this Article Seven in defending a\nproceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such proceeding\u2019s final disposition unless otherwise\ndetermined by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the\ndirector or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by\nthe Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and\nconditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.\nSection 6.\u2003Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article Seven\nand who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the\nCorporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may\nbe indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.\nSection 7.\u2003Contract Rights. The provisions of this Article Seven shall be deemed to be a contract right between the\nCorporation and each director or officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article Seven and the\nrelevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or other applicable law are in effect, and\nany repeal or modification of this Article Seven or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing\nwith respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.\nA-69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection 8.\u2003Merger or Consolidation.
