If a quorum is\nnot present at the special meeting, the special meeting may, and at the request of Amazon.com, will, be adjourned or postponed from time to time by\nthe presiding officer (subject to the terms of the merger agreement and the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated By-Laws) until a quorum is obtained.\nAs of the close of business on September 2, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, there were 27,233,499 shares of common stock\noutstanding.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted\nfor the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and do not give any\ninstruction to your broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the special meeting, those shares will not be entitled to\nvote on any proposal at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?\nA:\nApproval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close\nof business on the record date for the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from voting will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote of iRobot stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting?\nA:\nEach of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and\nagainst such proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting.\nAn abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other\nnominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have no effect on these proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).\nThe approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal are not conditions to the\ncompletion of the merger.\nQ:\nHow does the iRobot board of directors recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe iRobot board of directors unanimously recommends that iRobot stockholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the iRobot board of directors considered in determining to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger\nagreement, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the iRobot Board of\nDirectors.\u201d In addition, in considering the recommendation of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be\naware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company\nstockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nHow do iRobot\u2019s directors and officers intend to vote?\nA:\nWe currently expect that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the merger as promptly as possible, but as of the date of this proxy statement we cannot accurately estimate the\nclosing date of the merger because the merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions\nto Amazon.com, Merger Sub and the Company\u2019s respective obligations to consummate the merger, some of which are not within the parties\u2019\ncontrol. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger, and it is possible that the merger\nwill not be completed at all. After the requisite company vote is obtained, the iRobot board of directors will not have the right to terminate the\nmerger agreement in order to accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger promptly after the requisite company\nvote is obtained and all required regulatory clearances have been received.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not approved and adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will\nremain a public company, and shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on\nNASDAQ. In the event that either iRobot or Amazon.com terminates the merger agreement, then, in certain specified circumstances, iRobot may be\nrequired to pay Amazon.com a termination fee in an amount equal to $56 million. Furthermore, if the merger agreement is terminated by either iRobot\nor Amazon.com because the requisite company vote has not been obtained or the outside date lapses without stockholders having approved the\nmerger agreement, iRobot will be required to pay to Amazon.com all of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\nAmazon.com and Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions in an amount not to exceed $17 million (which amount\nwill be deducted from the amount of any termination fee owed or payable by the Company). See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014\nTermination Fees\u037e Expense Reimbursement.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in\nthis proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you\nown.\nVoting Virtually\nStockholders of record will be able to vote virtually at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of\ncommon stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or\nother nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the special meeting.\nIt is not necessary to virtually attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the\nspecial meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting virtually.\nAttending the meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can also ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:\n\u2022\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope\u037e\n20\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ntelephone, by calling the telephone number indicated on your proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the easy prompts\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet, by accessing the voting site indicated on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the simple instructions.\nIf you had earlier consented to receiving proxy materials by email, you may simply click the \u201cVOTE NOW\u201d button in the accompanying\nemail.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d\n(1) the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, (2) the compensation proposal, and (3) the adjournment proposal.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on virtually attending the special meeting.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A\nfailure to vote or an abstention will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a quorum is present).\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank\nor other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not\nhave discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, without your instructions, your shares\nheld in street name will not be present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum\nis present at the special meeting, and will not be voted on any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of\nshares held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no\ninstruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the special meeting for purposes of establishing a\nquorum at the special meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with\nrespect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your\nproxy by notifying the Company at iRobot Corporation, 8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Secretary, or by submitting a new proxy by\ntelephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy\nbeing revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by virtually attending the special meeting and voting virtually\u037e however, simply attending\nthe special meeting virtually will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you have\ninstructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other\nnominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting virtually at\nthe special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are\n21\nTable of Contents\nvoted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other\nnominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your nominee may not vote your shares on the proposal to approve and\nadopt the merger agreement.\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of votes properly cast for and against those\nproposals, assuming a quorum is present. If you do not vote or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal and the\nadjournment proposal (assuming that a quorum is present).\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)\u037e however, the approval of this\nproposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. In addition, the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not\nbe binding on the Company or Amazon.com. If the merger agreement is approved and adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders and the merger is\ncompleted, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their\ncompensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder\nof record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by iRobot.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of common stock held in\n\u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect\nto those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to\nvote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Because of the non-routine nature of the proposals to be voted on at the special\nmeeting, your broker, bank or other nominee is not authorized to vote your shares on any proposal without instructions from you. You are also\ninvited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting\nunless you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, as the stockholder of record, authorizing you to vote your shares.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special\nmeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you\nvoted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the other two proposals (assuming that a\nquorum is present).\nQ:\nWill my shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold\nof record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder (that is, your\ncustodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of\n22\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of\ncommon stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as\ntrustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common\nstock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be\nvoted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of common stock\nheld in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted\nat the special meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting\ninstruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by\ntelephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?\nA:\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you\ntransfer your shares of common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in\nthe merger.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the merger. If you transfer your shares of\ncommon stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made\nbetween you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies iRobot in writing of such special\narrangements, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration. You will also lose the\nability to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your\nshares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope or grant your proxy electronically or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed\nwritten instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of\ncommon stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other\nnominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger consideration.\nDo not send in your stock certificates now.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, iRobot\nstockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger and otherwise comply with, and do not validly withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights\nunder, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to iRobot stockholders who properly deliver,\nand do not properly withdraw, a written\n23\nTable of Contents\ndemand for an appraisal to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with,\nand do not otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the other procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are\nsummarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a iRobot stockholder would be\nentitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights of iRobot\nStockholders.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262).\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial\nowners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received\nhouseholding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy\nstatement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may\ndecide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be\nconsidered and voted on at the special meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of\ncommon stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for\nor against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nIf available, iRobot may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. iRobot intends to publish final voting results\nin a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that iRobot files with the SEC are publicly\navailable when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about iRobot?\nA:\nYou can find more information about the Company from various sources described in the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional\nInformation.\u201d\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of the\nproxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree\n24\nTable of Contents\nM&A Incorporated (\u201cInnisfree\u201d), which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent and information agent for the Company in connection with the\nmerger, at the telephone numbers or address below.\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nStockholders May Call:\n1 (877) 750-8332 (TOLL-FREE from the U.S. and Canada)\nor\n+1 (412) 232-3651 (From other countries)\nIf your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you should also call your broker, bank or other nominee for additional information.\n25\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of iRobot\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the iRobot board of directors and management\nof iRobot (\u201ciRobot management\u201d or \u201cCompany management\u201d) periodically review, consider and assess iRobot\u2019s operations and financial performance, as\nwell as overall industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing\nshareholder value. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations,\nacquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2022, the iRobot board of directors and iRobot management actively assessed rapidly evolving industry,\nglobal and regional macroeconomic trends and geopolitical dynamics, intensifying competitive conditions and inflationary price pressures relevant to\niRobot\u2019s business, performance and long-term prospects.\nAmazon.com had previously approached iRobot in November 2016 to propose an acquisition of iRobot at $60.50 per share. In response, iRobot had\nengaged an outside financial advisor to help the iRobot board of directors in its consideration of that offer. The iRobot board of directors\u2019 work with its\nfinancial advisor at the time, combined with other relevant factors considered by the iRobot board of directors, resulted in iRobot informing Amazon.com\nthat its offer undervalued iRobot. In the subsequent months, iRobot\u2019s trading price increased materially, and Amazon.com discontinued its engagement\nwith respect to a potential acquisition of iRobot. Since that time, iRobot management continued to engage approximately once per year with Amazon.com\nrepresentatives on matters unrelated to a potential mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) transaction.\nAs part of iRobot\u2019s ordinary course business planning, at the direction of the iRobot board of directors, members of iRobot management in\nNovember and December 2021 had prepared a long-term business and strategy plan through fiscal year 2024 (the \u201cDecember 2021 business plan\u201d), which\nwas presented to the iRobot board of directors. A portion of the December 2021 business plan was shared with investors on December 9, 2021 during\niRobot\u2019s investor day.\nOn May 16, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com called Mr. Colin Angle, Chief Executive Officer of iRobot. On the call, Amazon.com expressed\ninterest in a potential transaction to acquire iRobot (such potential transaction involving iRobot and Amazon.com, the \u201cproposed transaction\u201d) and\nindicated that Amazon.com could move expeditiously in its due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documentation for the proposed transaction.\nOn the call, Mr. Angle did not indicate whether iRobot was interested in the proposed transaction and made no commitment as to any next steps,\nincluding whether to permit Amazon.com to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and gain access to confidential due diligence information regarding\niRobot. Following the call, Mr. Angle gave an update regarding the call to certain members of the iRobot board of directors.\nOn May 23, 2022, with the permission of the members of the iRobot board of directors with whom Mr. Angle spoke, iRobot entered into a\nsupplement to its existing non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.com. This supplement contained customary \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions binding on\nAmazon.com, and provided that such standstill provisions would automatically terminate in the event that certain change of control events relating to\niRobot occurred.\n35Table of Contents\nOn May 25, 2022, members of iRobot management met with members of Amazon.com management to discuss high-level due diligence matters in\nconnection with the proposed transaction. On the call, iRobot responded to questions that Amazon.com raised regarding iRobot\u2019s publicly disclosed\nfirst-quarter 2022 financial results and full-year 2022 guidance range. iRobot conveyed to Amazon.com that the December 2021 business plan was\nproduced as of December 2021 and had not been updated subsequently for changes in Company, industry and macroeconomic and geopolitical\nconditions. In addition, iRobot conveyed that given those changes and as a result of iRobot\u2019s updated view of currently anticipated second-quarter 2022\nfinancial performance, iRobot would likely be in the low end of the full-year 2022 guidance range provided to investors on May 4, 2022.\nOn May 26, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management also in attendance. Representatives of\nGoodwin Procter LLP, iRobot\u2019s outside counsel (\u201cGoodwin\u201d), attended portions of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, iRobot had shared with members of\niRobot management certain management guidelines which, among other things, directed management not to have any discussions regarding post-closing\nemployment with Amazon.com until and unless approved and authorized by the iRobot board of directors or a committee thereof. At the meeting, iRobot\nmanagement presented to the iRobot board of directors a comprehensive status update regarding the proposed transaction including the recent\ninteractions with Amazon.com. The iRobot board of directors also discussed interviews that members of iRobot management had conducted with\nrepresentatives of five investment banks with the iRobot board of directors\u2019 permission, including Qatalyst Partners LP (\u201cQatalyst Partners\u201d), in\nconnection with advising iRobot with respect to a potential strategic transaction. The iRobot board of directors then discussed the formal engagement of\nQatalyst Partners as its financial advisor in connection with its review of potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction, noting\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 experience opposite Amazon.com as well as Qatalyst Partners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which iRobot operates\nand experience advising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. On the basis of these considerations, and subject in\nall respects to the iRobot board of directors\u2019 review of a customary relationships disclosure to be produced by Qatalyst Partners (which disclosure was\nproduced by Qatalyst Partners on June 8, 2022 and was promptly shared with the transaction committee (as defined below) and the iRobot board of\ndirectors), the iRobot board of directors authorized iRobot management to negotiate terms of an engagement letter for the purpose of engaging Qatalyst\nPartners. Representatives of Goodwin also discussed the iRobot board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection with the evaluation of a potential\nstrategic transaction involving iRobot, whether with Amazon.com or any other counterparty. The iRobot board of directors also discussed that it would\nneed to evaluate iRobot\u2019s long-range plan and projections, the current value of iRobot and available strategic opportunities before determining how to\nrespond to Amazon.com\u2019s outreach. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors authorized management to develop a set of long-range plans and\nprojections (an \u201cLRP\u201d) for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2027. The directors were then invited to disclose any actual or potential conflicts\nof interest they may have in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. Ms. Eva Manolis disclosed a prior business relationship with Amazon.com in\naddition to ownership of Amazon.com stock that is material to her personal net worth\u037e the iRobot board of directors determined that, as such business\nrelationship was not recent and such business relationship and ownership of Amazon.com stock were disclosed to the iRobot board of directors, Ms.\nManolis would not be required to recuse herself with respect to the proposed transaction. Certain other directors also disclosed ownership of\nAmazon.com stock that was not material to their respective personal net worth. The iRobot board of directors also discussed adopting resolutions\nforming a transaction committee of the iRobot board of directors (the \u201ctransaction committee\u201d) to consider, review and evaluate any proposals made for a\npotential transaction with any counterparty as well as any alternatives to a potential strategic transaction, including, without limitation, iRobot continuing\nto operate as an independent, publicly traded company. The iRobot board of directors discussed that the transaction committee was being formed for\nexpediency of process, and not in response to any actual or potential conflict of interest concerns in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. The iRobot\nboard of directors also discussed its belief that it would be beneficial and in the best interests of stockholders for Mr. Angle to participate on the\ntransaction committee due to, among other reasons, his transactional skill and experience and his extensive knowledge of iRobot and the industry in\nwhich it operates. The iRobot board of directors then adopted resolutions forming the transaction committee, and\n36\nTable of Contents\nappointed Mr. Andrew Miller, an independent director, Ms. Michelle Stacy, an independent director, and Mr. Angle to the transaction committee.\nPromptly following this meeting, Mr. Miller, Ms. Stacy and Mr. Angle each answered written questions regarding their relationships, which confirmed that\neach was independent and disinterested in relation to Amazon.com and its affiliates. At the meeting, the iRobot board of directors also determined to\nrevisit the composition of the transaction committee in the event that iRobot engaged with any other counterparty with respect to which any of the\nincumbent members of the transaction committee were not independent or disinterested. Finally, at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors authorized\niRobot management to continue to engage in high-level due diligence with Amazon.com in relation to the proposed transaction.\nOn June 1, 2022, members of iRobot management again met with members of Amazon.com management to further discuss high-level due diligence\nmatters in relation to the proposed transaction.\nOn June 6, 2022, Mr. Glen Weinstein, Chief Legal Officer of iRobot, spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, and during this discussion, the\nAmazon.com representative indicated that Amazon.com was leaning toward making a non-binding proposal based on the information they had received\nthus far in due diligence, and that Amazon.com would be able to provide an updated view by the end of that week.\nOn June 8, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed strategy around its expectation that Amazon.com would make a non-binding proposal\nsometime that week, including the transaction committee\u2019s desire for Amazon.com to propose a set of terms related to regulatory matters as part of that\nproposal. The transaction committee also discussed general market dynamics and the regulatory landscape in connection with the proposed transaction.\nThe transaction committee then discussed a plan for the timing, scope and sequencing for a potential pre-signing market check. The transaction\ncommittee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners whether any potential acquirors other than Amazon.com would be likely to submit a\nproposal to acquire iRobot that would be superior to a proposal submitted by Amazon.com from a financial point of view, as well as execution and\nregulatory considerations, leak risk, competitive sensitivities and other relevant factors with respect to any such potential acquirors (including\nheightened national security-related execution risk with respect to certain potential non-U.S. acquirors that could make consummation of a transaction\nwith such potential non-U.S. acquirors challenging). Following such discussion, and taking into account these factors and the input provided by\nQatalyst Partners, the transaction committee determined to reach out to one additional potential acquiror, rather than conduct a broader outreach. The\ntransaction committee also noted that the iRobot board of directors would have the ability to consider superior proposals to acquire iRobot post-signing\nof any definitive agreement with Amazon.com through a customary \u201cfiduciary out.\u201d Participants in the meeting also expressed their belief that, among\npossible bidders for iRobot, a transaction with Amazon.com would present the most compelling strategic rationale, and discussed Amazon.com\u2019s strong\nindication that it was prepared to terminate engagement with iRobot if any leak were to occur with respect to the process. The transaction committee\ndetermined to reach out to the specific strategic counterparty (\u201cCompany A\u201d) as part of a market check process, but in light of the expected imminency of\nAmazon.com\u2019s initial proposal, the transaction committee determined not to make this outreach until after such initial proposal from Amazon.com was\nreceived.\nOn June 9, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com. In accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, Mr.\nWeinstein conveyed the transaction committee\u2019s desire that any non-binding proposal from Amazon.com should include a set of terms related to\nregulatory matters. Amazon.com also reaffirmed that satisfactory progress on due diligence was being made and that it was continuing to lean toward\nmaking a non-binding proposal in the near term.\nOn June 10, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors at its May 26, 2022 meeting, iRobot entered into an engagement\nletter with Qatalyst Partners formalizing the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to act as iRobot\u2019s financial advisor to, among other things, assist iRobot in\nevaluating potential strategic opportunities, including the proposed transaction.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOn June 17, 2022, Mr. Weinstein spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who indicated that a non-binding proposal for the acquisition of\niRobot would be submitted to iRobot by Amazon.com the following week.\nOn June 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who verbally communicated to Mr. Angle a non-binding proposal for\nAmazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash. Mr. Angle did not respond to this proposal during the call. Later on June 23, 2022, iRobot\nreceived a formal non-binding letter of intent from Amazon.com to acquire iRobot for $64.00 per share in cash (the \u201cJune 23 proposal\u201d). The $64.00 per\nshare offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to June 23, 2022 of approximately 51%. The June 23 proposal did not propose any\nterms related to regulatory matters as had been requested by iRobot. The June 23 proposal stated that Amazon.com reserved the right to immediately\nterminate engagement with iRobot regarding a potential transaction if any leak occurred with respect to the process, and that the proposal was not\nsubject to any financing condition. The June 23 proposal did not include any request for exclusivity. The June 23 proposal was promptly shared with the\niRobot board of directors.\nLater on June 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee directed management to finalize the LRP and, subject to iRobot board of directors or transaction\ncommittee review and approval, provide the finalized LRP to Qatalyst Partners for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection with the iRobot\nboard of directors\u2019 and the transaction committee\u2019s evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. The transaction\ncommittee also further discussed a potential pre-signing market check and determined and directed Qatalyst Partners, now that Amazon.com\u2019s initial\nproposal had been received, to reach out to Company A as part of the market check. The transaction committee then discussed with the advisors its belief\nthat Amazon.com\u2019s proposal constituted at least a credible initial offer at a significant premium to iRobot\u2019s current trading price. The transaction\ncommittee discussed the recent trading price of iRobot\u2019s stock and factors that may be affecting its trading price, and the execution risk and headwinds\nthat iRobot expected to face in executing its standalone plan moving forward.\nLater on June 23, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the transaction committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to a\nrepresentative of Company A, and the representatives of Qatalyst Partners followed up with the same representative of Company A the next day on June\n24, 2022.\nOn June 29, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The members of iRobot management presented their current draft of the LRP for the period from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year\n2027 as of June 27, 2022 (the \u201cCompany LRP\u201d). The members of iRobot management underscored in their presentation that in the latter half of the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2022, recessionary pressures had escalated in EMEA and had begun to disrupt the U.S. market more than expected, and noted their\nexpectation that iRobot\u2019s actual financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, once finalized, would fall significantly below the low end\nof the publicly announced guidance range for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and would cause full-year 2022 performance to fall significantly\nbelow the low end of the publicly announced guidance range for fiscal year 2022 (collectively, the \u201cQ2 earnings miss\u201d). The members of iRobot\nmanagement stated that they remained cautious and uncertain about the speed and nature of market recovery and iRobot\u2019s own performance in coming\nyears in light of these conditions. As a result of these operational and macroeconomic uncertainties, in connection with the preparation of the Company\nLRP, iRobot management prepared certain sensitivity scenarios with respect to the Company LRP that reflected stronger and weaker Company\nperformance for the projected period based on the assumed pace of market recovery from recent industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In\npresenting the Company LRP to the iRobot board of directors on June 29, 2022, members of iRobot management indicated that these separate scenarios\nwere being provided to the iRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would\nnot be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively\nnot be asked to, approve any of these separate scenarios and that these separate scenarios remained subject to change, as management was still actively\nfinalizing its review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. Following discussion, the iRobot board of directors approved\nthe Company LRP and directed Qatalyst Partners to use and rely on the Company LRP for purposes of providing financial analyses in connection\n38\nTable of Contents\nwith the iRobot board of directors\u2019 evaluation of any potential strategic transaction, including the proposed transaction. Qatalyst Partners then reviewed\nthe June 23 proposal from a financial point of view in light of the Company LRP. The iRobot board of directors also asked management to update the\nmarket recovery scenarios based on management\u2019s finalization of its assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance and, upon\ncompletion of any such updates, to share related financial information with Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com\u2019s business and financial due\ndiligence. Goodwin also presented a proposed set of certain non-price terms with respect to which iRobot could potentially initiate negotiations over\nregulatory matters, which included (among other things) (a) a reverse termination fee, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the event that a\nregulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the proposed transaction, (c) a \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from engaging in other M&A\ntransactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the obtaining of antitrust clearance for the proposed transaction and (d) an\noutside date of up to 18 months (on an as-extended basis). Finally, the iRobot board of directors discussed tactical considerations relating to iRobot\u2019s\npotential response to Amazon.com\u2019s June 23 proposal. The iRobot board of directors (a) directed Qatalyst Partners to respond to Amazon.com (i) with a\nspecific price counterproposal of $70.00 per share, (ii) reiterating the iRobot board of directors\u2019 expectation that the parties agree upon a set of terms\nrelated to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documentation and (iii) previewing iRobot\u2019s Q2 earnings miss and\nsharing certain financial information in that regard and (b) directed Goodwin to propose the set of certain non-price terms to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,\nWharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), Amazon.com\u2019s outside counsel.\nLater on June 29, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to\nrepresentatives of Amazon.com and conveyed the counterproposal of $70.00 per share, and reiterated the iRobot board of directors\u2019 expectation that the\nparties agree upon a set of terms related to regulatory matters prior to negotiating the details of definitive transaction documents. The representatives of\nQatalyst Partners also previewed iRobot\u2019s Q2 earnings miss to the representatives of Amazon.com and indicated that iRobot would likely not meet the\nlow end of its full-year 2022 guidance range, and shared certain financial information in that regard. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also\ndiscussed with representatives of Amazon.com the parties\u2019 expectations with respect to transaction timing and Amazon.com\u2019s ability to move forward\nexpeditiously to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement in respect of the proposed transaction. The representatives of Amazon.com reiterated that\nAmazon.com was capable of moving expeditiously to a signing of a definitive agreement, but that it had little room to move on deal price, and that the\nAmazon.com representatives would require a call with representatives of iRobot to better understand the Q2 earnings miss prior to responding to the\npoints conveyed by the representatives of Qatalyst Partners.\nOn June 30, 2022, representatives of iRobot spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss the Q2 earnings miss. As a result of iRobot\nmanagement\u2019s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, on this call the representatives of iRobot presented\ninformation with respect to actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance. On the call, the representatives of Amazon.com conveyed that the Q2\nearnings miss, as well as the expectation that iRobot would likely not meet the low end of its full-year 2022 guidance, had been a surprise to them and that\nthey would require some time to evaluate.\nAlso on June 30, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with a representative of Company A, who conveyed that Company A was\nevaluating a potential transaction with iRobot but had not yet gained sufficient internal support to pursue a potential transaction and would therefore be\nunlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot.\nOn July 1, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com asked members of iRobot management follow-up questions related to iRobot\u2019s financial\nperformance stemming from the financial information provided on June 29 and June 30, 2022, to which members of iRobot management responded.\nOn July 2, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin proposed to Paul Weiss and\nAmazon.com\u2019s outside regulatory counsel the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters that was previously presented to the iRobot board of\ndirectors at the June 29, 2022 meeting.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOn July 4, 2022, representatives of Amazon.com spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, during which Amazon.com (i) reaffirmed its offer\nprice of $64.00 per share notwithstanding the Q2 earnings miss, predicated on the parties\u2019 entry into and announcement of a definitive agreement either\nprior to or concurrently with iRobot\u2019s earnings announcement for the second quarter 2022, it being understood that, standing alone, the public\nannouncement of the Q2 earnings miss would be expected to adversely impact iRobot\u2019s trading price, and (ii) provided Amazon.com\u2019s counterproposal\nwith respect to the set of certain non-price terms previously provided by iRobot, which counterproposal included (among other things) (a) an \u201cantitrust\u201d\n(and not explicitly a foreign investment law) reverse termination fee equal to 5% of iRobot\u2019s equity value, (b) an obligation to litigate on the merits in the\nevent that a regulatory agency were to seek to enjoin the transaction, (c) a \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant prohibiting Amazon.com from acquiring a specific list\nof companies during the pendency of a transaction and (d) an outside date of up to 24 months (on an as-extended basis) (the \u201cJuly 4 proposal\u201d). The\nreaffirmed $64.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to July 4, 2022 of approximately 71%.\nAlso on July 4, 2022, in response to the July 4 proposal, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and during this call Mr. Angle\nexpressed that he was personally not supportive of Amazon.com\u2019s $64.00 per share price proposal but could potentially support a deal price of $65.00 per\nshare, subject to input from the iRobot board of directors.\nLater on July 4, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee and its advisors discussed the developments described above since the June 29, 2022 iRobot\nboard of directors meeting, including the July 4 proposal. The transaction committee also discussed its view that the set of non-price terms related to\nregulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as part of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. The transaction\ncommittee resolved to recommend to the iRobot board of directors that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com and that, subject to continued\nevaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price of $64.00 or more, combined\nwith terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a transaction that is in the best\ninterests of iRobot and its stockholders.\nImmediately following this transaction committee meeting on July 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors discussed the\ndevelopments described above since the June 29, 2022 meeting of the iRobot board of directors, including the July 4 proposal. The iRobot board of\ndirectors also discussed the transaction committee\u2019s impression that the set of non-price terms related to regulatory matters proposed by Amazon.com as\npart of the July 4 proposal was favorable to iRobot and would be generally acceptable. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then conveyed to the iRobot\nboard of directors that Company A had indicated that it would be unlikely to proceed further in discussions of a potential acquisition of iRobot, and that\nit was accordingly Qatalyst Partners\u2019 expectation that no proposal would be forthcoming from Company A. Following the transaction committee\u2019s\nrecommendation to the iRobot board of directors of the same, the iRobot board of directors approved that iRobot continue to engage with Amazon.com\nand that, subject to continued evaluation by the iRobot board of directors in all respects, a transaction with Amazon.com entered into at a per share price\nof $64.00 or more, combined with terms related to regulatory matters that are as proposed by Amazon.com or better, would be expected to constitute a\ntransaction that is in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders. The iRobot board of directors and its advisors then discussed with management\nthe specific terms of a counterproposal that iRobot would make to Amazon.com as part of such continuing negotiations, which the iRobot board of\ndirectors determined would consist of (i) a deal price of $65.00 per share, (ii) a reverse termination fee equal to 8% of iRobot\u2019s equity value and (iii) a more\nexpansive \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant that was not limited to a list of specific companies.\nOn July 5, 2022, in accordance with the direction of the iRobot board of directors, representatives of Goodwin reaffirmed to representatives of Paul\nWeiss that iRobot\u2019s counterproposal consisted of the three points described above.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn July 6, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com. During such discussion, Amazon.com (i) raised its\noffer price to $64.50 per share but characterized this price as its best and final offer, (ii) proposed a $100 million reverse termination fee, which was\nequivalent to approximately 5.4% of iRobot\u2019s equity value, and (iii) rejected iRobot\u2019s proposed expansion of the \u201cclear skies\u201d covenant, reverting to the\nconstruct of a list of specific companies (the \u201cJuly 6 proposal\u201d). The $64.50 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to\nJuly 6, 2022 of approximately 63%. As the terms of the July 6 proposal were more favorable to iRobot than the terms that the iRobot board of directors\nfound acceptable at the July 4, 2022 iRobot board of directors meeting, later on July 6, 2022, Mr. Angle had a phone conversation with a representative of\nAmazon.com and conveyed iRobot\u2019s willingness to move forward with the proposed transaction on the basis of the July 6 proposal (including as to the\n$64.50 per share deal price), subject to final iRobot board of directors approval.\nLater on July 6, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with other of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The members of the transaction committee discussed the July 6 proposal. Following discussion with Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin, the members of the transaction committee noted that its view that iRobot had likely obtained the most favorable package of material deal terms\nthat could reasonably be obtained from Amazon.com. under the circumstances. The transaction committee approved that iRobot continue to engage with\nAmazon.com on the basis of the July 6 proposal, including with respect to due diligence and the negotiation of a definitive agreement.\nIn accordance with this direction of the transaction committee, iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin\nproceeded to conduct multiple due diligence management sessions with representatives of Amazon.com from July 6, 2022 through July 18, 2022. iRobot\nmanagement and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also continued to respond to Amazon.com\u2019s documentary due diligence requests\nuntil the parties\u2019 entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.\nOn July 9, 2022, Paul Weiss sent to Goodwin Amazon.com\u2019s initial draft of a proposed merger agreement for the proposed transaction. Paul Weiss\nand Goodwin continued to negotiate and revise the merger agreement until the parties\u2019 entry into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022.\nOn July 13, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed key legal issues reflected in Amazon.com\u2019s initial draft of the merger agreement\nreceived on July 9, 2022. The transaction committee also took note that the draft merger agreement indicated that Amazon.com would seek to have\ndiscussions with key executives of iRobot regarding post-closing employment with Amazon.com.\nAlso on July 13, 2022, in connection with the continued due diligence approved by the transaction committee on July 6, 2022, iRobot provided\nAmazon.com with a portion of the sensitivity scenario based on the Updated Company LRP (as defined and discussed below) that had been prepared by\niRobot management in early July 2022 and that reflected stronger Company performance assuming an accelerated pace of market recovery from recent\nindustry, macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility (the \u201caccelerated market recovery scenario\u201d), as compared to the assumptions reflected in the\nUpdated Company LRP.\nOn July 14, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com spoke with a representative of Qatalyst Partners. The call primarily covered due diligence\nlogistics, but the representative of Amazon.com also conveyed Amazon.com\u2019s view that the information presented in the accelerated market recovery\nscenario was below its expectations and that Amazon.com was still considering such information.\nOn July 18, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com in connection with Amazon.com\u2019s due diligence of the senior executive\nteam at iRobot. The call did not involve any discussion about post-closing compensatory or other employment arrangements.\nOn July 20, 2022, Ms. Julie Zeiler, Chief Financial Officer of iRobot, exchanged emails with a representative of Amazon.com. Ms. Zeiler reported that,\nas a result of iRobot management\u2019s continued review\n41\nTable of Contents\nand assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial performance, iRobot was projecting an additional shortfall in revenue and non-GAAP operating\nincome (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger \u2014Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) for the second quarter 2022\nrelative to what was previously presented to Amazon.com.\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Amazon.com\u2019s financial advisor, spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express\nconcern about iRobot\u2019s financial performance and previewing that Amazon.com was evaluating a potential reduction in its offer price. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners responded on these communications that a price reduction would be received very poorly by the iRobot board of directors.\nAlso on July 22, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com, who conveyed that Amazon.com was reducing its offer price from\n$64.50 to $60.00 per share (the \u201cJuly 22 proposal\u201d). The $60.00 per share offer price implied a premium to iRobot\u2019s last closing price prior to July 22, 2022 of\napproximately 34%. The representative of Amazon.com also conveyed strongly that Amazon.com would not have any significant additional headroom on\nthe deal price.\nOn July 23, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee discussed the July 22 proposal. The transaction committee further discussed with Qatalyst\nPartners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether\nAmazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The transaction committee reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential\nimplications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot\u2019s revised second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance. The transaction committee members generally opined that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal would\nresult in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot\u2019s recent financial\nunderperformance and the market and execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain\nindustry, macroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The\ntransaction committee determined to present this feedback to the iRobot board of directors at the meeting immediately following the July 23 transaction\ncommittee meeting.\nOn July 23, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. The iRobot board of directors discussed the July 22 proposal. The iRobot board of directors further discussed with Qatalyst\nPartners whether Amazon.com was genuinely prepared to terminate engagement with respect to the proposed transaction entirely or whether\nAmazon.com was simply seeking added leverage in negotiations with iRobot. The iRobot board of directors reviewed with Qatalyst Partners potential\nimplications of another public M&A transaction recently announced by Amazon.com, as well as iRobot\u2019s revised second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance. The transaction committee members provided their opinion that, while such recent developments were disappointing, the July 22 proposal\nwould result in a transaction that was still in the best interests of iRobot stockholders, especially in light of, among other things, iRobot\u2019s recent financial\nunderperformance and the execution risks associated with its standalone plan. The transaction committee members cited the highly uncertain industry,\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical landscapes over the coming years, and the uncertainty related to the timing of any market recovery. The iRobot board of\ndirectors generally agreed with the transaction committee\u2019s feedback on the July 22 proposal. As a result, the iRobot board of directors authorized\nmanagement to revert to (i) Amazon.com with a counterproposal of $61.00 per share and (ii) ultimately continue engagement with Amazon.com at a deal\nprice of at least $60.50 per share.\nLater on July 23, 2022, Mr. Angle spoke with a representative of Amazon.com and relayed the counterproposal of $61.00 per share, and the\nrepresentative of Amazon.com conveyed that Amazon.com would agree to $61.00 per share as its best and final offer price. In accordance with the\ndirection of the iRobot board of\n42\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, Mr. Angle expressed iRobot\u2019s willingness to move forward at $61.00 per share as the final deal price for the proposed transaction and as a basis\nfor considering negotiation of the other material terms of the proposed transaction.\nOver the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on August 4, 2022, the parties finalized their\nnegotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents pertaining to the proposed transaction, with the representatives of\nGoodwin and Paul Weiss continuing to exchange drafts of such documents, and Amazon.com concluded its due diligence process.\nSubsequent to the parties agreeing on valuation as a basis for moving forward, on July 25, 2022, a representative of Amazon.com requested that\nAmazon.com be permitted to initiate discussions with Mr. Angle regarding Mr. Angle\u2019s potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com and the\nterms thereof. Amazon.com stated that such discussions and agreement with respect to post-closing employment terms for Mr. Angle would be a\ncondition to signing a definitive agreement with respect to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goodwin discussed this request with the\nmembers of the transaction committee other than Mr. Angle, and following such discussion, and in light of the parties having agreed on valuation and the\nnon-financial transaction terms as a basis for moving forward, these other members unanimously authorized Mr. Angle to have such discussions with\nAmazon.com, subject to Goodwin supervising such discussions on behalf of iRobot and Mr. Angle retaining his own legal counsel. Mr. Angle retained\nhis own legal counsel later on July 25, 2022, and over the course of the ensuing several days, Mr. Angle negotiated his post-closing compensatory\narrangements independently with Amazon.com and arrived at an agreement on such terms (see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of\nthe Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger \u2013 New Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers\u201d). Prior to these developments and\nnegotiations commencing on July 25, 2022, under no circumstance did Mr. Angle discuss his potential post-closing employment with Amazon.com or the\nterms thereof with any representatives of Amazon.com.\nOn July 26, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting, with representatives of Goodwin also in attendance. The transaction committee\ndiscussed general status updates relating to the proposed transaction. Immediately after this transaction committee meeting, Mr. Miller and Ms. Stacy\nheld an executive session with representatives of Goodwin and discussed matters relating to Mr. Angle\u2019s post-closing employment with Amazon.com.\nOn July 28, 2022, members of iRobot management spoke with representatives of Amazon.com to discuss communications planning related to the\nproposed transaction. The parties agreed to target the public announcement of the proposed transaction on August 5, 2022, assuming that a definitive\nagreement was entered into on or prior to such date.\nOn July 31, 2022, the iRobot board of directors held a meeting, with members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nGoodwin also in attendance. Representatives of Goodwin again informed the iRobot board of directors about the history of Amazon.com\u2019s discussions\nand eventual agreement with Mr. Angle regarding his post-closing compensatory arrangements. Representatives of Goodwin then presented the\nproposed final material legal terms in the definitive agreement and ancillary documents to be entered into with Amazon.com and reviewed with the\ndirectors their fiduciary duties. Members of iRobot management then presented an update to the Company LRP (the \u201cUpdated Company LRP\u201d) and the\nrelated sensitivity scenarios to the iRobot board of directors, which Updated Company LRP and related sensitivity scenarios had been updated following\nthe closing of iRobot\u2019s second fiscal quarter as a result of iRobot management\u2019s continued review and assessment of actual second-quarter 2022 financial\nperformance, based on additional information that first became available to iRobot management following the closing of the second quarter, and which\nupdate was explained to the iRobot board of directors. The Updated Company LRP principally reflected changes to iRobot\u2019s projected performance for\nthe second half of fiscal year 2022, and for fiscal years 2023 to 2027, iRobot\u2019s projected revenue, non-GAAP gross profit (as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger \u2014 Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d) and non-GAAP operating income remained unchanged, except\n43\nTable of Contents\nthat iRobot\u2019s projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and unlevered free cash flow were modified\nslightly to reflect the most recent and updated view of iRobot management with respect to iRobot\u2019s long-term working capital and capital spend.\nMembers of iRobot management reiterated that, other than the Updated Company LRP, the updated sensitivity scenarios were being provided to the\niRobot board of directors for informational purposes, that the iRobot board of directors was not being asked to, and would not be asked to, approve any\nof these separate sensitivity scenarios. Following discussion by the iRobot board of directors, including regarding the execution risks associated with\niRobot\u2019s standalone plan and the uncertainty associated with the timing of the market recovery, the iRobot board of directors directed that Qatalyst\nPartners use and rely on the Updated Company LRP for purposes of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses in rendering its opinion with respect to the\nproposed transaction.\nOn August 4, 2022, the parties finalized the negotiation and drafting of the terms of the merger agreement and related ancillary documents\npertaining to the proposed transaction as well as Amazon.com\u2019s due diligence process, and the transaction committee held a meeting to review the final\nterms of the proposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to recommend\nentry into such definitive agreement to the iRobot board of directors. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Goodwin and Qatalyst\nPartners also attended the meeting. The transaction committee discussed its reasons in favor of recommending the proposed transaction to the iRobot\nboard of directors, as well as considerations of risk pertaining to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then reviewed with the\ntransaction committee a summary form of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses with respect to the proposed transaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal\nprice and the Updated Company LRP, and noted that a more detailed summary would be provided to the full iRobot board of directors at the upcoming\niRobot board of directors meeting, and stated that Qatalyst Partners would be prepared to deliver its fairness opinion (on the basis of the $61.00 deal price\nand the Updated Company LRP) at such upcoming iRobot board of directors meeting. Representatives of Goodwin then reviewed with the transaction\ncommittee the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as the ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain\nmembers of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The transaction committee then adopted\nresolutions favorably recommending the proposed transaction with Amazon.com to the iRobot board of directors, except that Mr. Angle voluntarily\nrecused himself from this vote in light of his employment discussions with Amazon.com, in order to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest of the\ntransaction committee.\nImmediately following this transaction committee meeting on August 4, 2022, the iRobot board of directors met to review the final terms of the\nproposed definitive agreement between iRobot and Amazon.com and related ancillary documents and to vote on whether to approve entry into the\nproposed definitive agreement with Amazon.com. Members of iRobot management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin also attended\nthe meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its financial analyses with respect to the proposed\ntransaction on the basis of the $61.00 deal price and the Updated Company LRP. Representatives of Goodwin then reminded the iRobot board of directors\nof the employment discussions and agreement between Mr. Angle and Amazon.com, as well as certain ownership of Amazon.com stock by certain\nmembers of the iRobot board of directors, as had previously been previewed with the iRobot board of directors. The iRobot board of directors (other than\nMr. Angle) unanimously approved participation by Mr. Angle and such other members of the iRobot board of directors in their discussions regarding,\nand their voting upon, the proposed transaction. Members of the transaction committee then presented the formal recommendation of the transaction\ncommittee with respect to the proposed transaction, including that it was the transaction committee\u2019s determination to favorably recommend that the\niRobot board of directors approve the proposed transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the iRobot board of directors its\nfinancial analyses of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its\npresentation, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of\nAugust 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger\nconsideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\n44\nTable of Contents\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, please see\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP\u201d. After extensive discussions of the\nproposed transaction with Amazon.com and the matters summarized for the iRobot board of directors at the meeting, the iRobot board of directors then\nunanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of iRobot and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement\nwith Amazon.com, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with Amazon.com and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that iRobot stockholders adopt the merger agreement with Amazon.com and directed that such\nmatter be submitted for consideration of iRobot stockholders at a special meeting of iRobot stockholders.\nLater in the evening on August 4, 2022, iRobot and Amazon.com executed and delivered the merger agreement.\nEarly in the morning on August 5, 2022, the parties issued a press release publicly announcing the proposed transaction.",

For more information, see section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nAfter taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the iRobot board of directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties,\nrestrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby were outweighed by the\npositive factors and potential benefits associated with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that supported its determination\nand recommendation. Accordingly, the iRobot board of directors determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are\nadvisable and in the best interests of, iRobot and its stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the iRobot board of directors includes the material factors considered by\nthe iRobot board of directors but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the iRobot board of directors. The members of the iRobot\nboard of directors evaluated the various factors listed above, among other things, in light of their knowledge of the business, financial condition and\nprospects of iRobot and considered the advice of iRobot\u2019s independent financial and legal advisors. In view of the complexity and variety of factors\nconsidered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the iRobot board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did\nnot, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in\nconsidering the information and reasons described above, individual members of the iRobot board of directors each applied his or her own personal\nbusiness judgment to the process and may have given different weights to different factors. The iRobot board of directors did not undertake to make any\nspecific determinations as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determinations. The\niRobot board of directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iRobot approve the merger and the merger agreement based\nupon the totality of information it considered.\nWhen considering the foregoing recommendation of the iRobot board of directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement, stockholders should be aware that some of iRobot\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or\nin addition to, the interests of stockholders more generally. The iRobot board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other\nmatters, to the extent that they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the merger agreement and the transactions were advisable and in the\nbest interests of iRobot and its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the\nmerger agreement and the consummation of the transactions, in making its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement and approval of the transactions and in directing that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders.\nFor more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014 Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger.\u201d\nThe explanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d",

The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates and experience advising technology companies in connection\nwith potential strategic transactions. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the\nmeeting of the iRobot board of directors on August 4, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the iRobot board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently\nconfirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 4, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other\nmatters set forth therein, the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst Partners delivered its written\nopinion, dated August 4, 2022, to the iRobot board of directors.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated as of August 4, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated\ninto this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nlimitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its\nentirety. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the iRobot board of directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or\nany affiliate of Amazon.com), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement,\nincluding the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the merger or any other\nmatter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst\nPartners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B.\nFor purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft, dated as of August 3, 2022, of the merger agreement (the \u201cdraft merger agreement\u201d),\ncertain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst\nPartners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including the Updated\nCompany LRP, described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014 Certain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d\nAdditionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior\nmanagement of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared\nthe financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-\ntraded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered\nsuch other factors as it deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to\nthe Updated Company LRP, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Company management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Updated Company LRP\nhad been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Company management of the future financial\nperformance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to such Updated Company LRP or the\nassumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement would not differ materially from the final\nexecuted merger agreement and that the merger would be consummated in accordance\n54\nTable of Contents\nwith the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nassumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions\nwould be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed transaction.\nQatalyst Partners relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to\nlegal, tax or regulatory matters. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nrelied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products\nof the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions\nused in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion\ndid not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any\nstrategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nmerger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,\nthe terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), and\nQatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or\nemployees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated August 4, 2022. The\nanalyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all\nanalyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its analyses,\nQatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts\u2019 projections of the future financial performance of the Company as of\nAugust 3, 2022 (the \u201canalyst projections\u201d) and the Updated Company LRP described more fully in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) \u2014\nCertain iRobot Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular\nformat. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must\nbe read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nfinancial analyses.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential, present values of a share\nof Company common stock as of July 2, 2022 (which was the end of the Company\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet\ndate) by:\n\u2022\nadding:\n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s corresponding estimated future unlevered free cash flows, based on the Updated\nCompany LRP, for the third quarter of calendar year 2022 through calendar year 2026 (which implied present value was calculated by\nusing a range of discount rates of 11.5% to 15.5%, based on the Company\u2019s estimated weighted average cost of capital\u037e\n55\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nthe implied net present value of the Company\u2019s terminal value, calculated by multiplying its estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar\nyear 2027 based on the Updated Company LRP by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months estimated EBITDA\nof 6.0x to 12.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the\nsame range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e and\n(c)\nthe Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents of $63,000,000 as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e and\n\u2022\nsubtracting the $35,000,000 principal amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt as of July 2, 2022, as provided by Company management\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ndividing the resulting amount by: the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, each\noutstanding as of the close of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, with each of the\nabove-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated\ndilution to current stockholders through each respective applicable period due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and\ncancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Company management.\nBased on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Company common stock of approximately $49.84 to\n$94.59.\nSelected Companies Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for the Company with publicly available information and\npublic market multiples for certain selected companies, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including\nthat they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or\nhave other relevant or similar characteristics.

For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners calculated the Company\u2019s\nenterprise value assuming the Company\u2019s net cash as of July 2, 2022, which was approximately $28,000,000, as provided by Company\u2019s management.\nEstimated Revenue Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E Revenue\nMultiple for the Company of 0.79x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n0.60x to 0.85x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 revenue of $1.595 billion based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $34.29 to $48.13 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nEstimated EBITDA Multiples\nBased upon the analyst projections and the Company\u2019s closing price as of August 3, 2022, Qatalyst Partners calculated a CY2023E EBITDA\nMultiple for the Company of 12.4x.\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E EBITDA Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of\n7.0x to 13.0x and applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated calendar year 2023 EBITDA of $94,000,000 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nBased on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Company common stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock\nmethod), adjusted, as applicable, for Company options, Company RSU awards, Company PSU awards and Company DSU awards, outstanding as of the\nclose of business on August 3, 2022, all of which amounts were provided by Company management, this analysis implied a range of per share values for\nCompany common stock of approximately $23.78 to $43.29 based on the Updated Company LRP.\nNo company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many\nof these matters are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business and the industry in general, industry\ngrowth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in\ngeneral. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using selected company data.\n57\nTable of Contents\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the iRobot board of directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative\nanalyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial\nanalysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nAny estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more\nor less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), to such\nholders. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Company common stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the iRobot board of directors was one of many factors considered by the iRobot board of\ndirectors in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nopinion of the iRobot board of directors with respect to the merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest\nthereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock\n(other than Amazon.com or any affiliate of Amazon.com), or of whether the iRobot board of directors would have been willing to agree to different\nconsideration. The merger consideration of $61.00 per share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon, payable in the merger was\ndetermined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Amazon.com and was unanimously approved by the iRobot board of directors.\nQatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration\nto the Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from\nwhich conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Amazon.com or certain of their respective\naffiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of\nits affiliates and the Company or Amazon.com pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners\nand/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Amazon.com and their respective\naffiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provided financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed transaction for which it will be paid\napproximately $31 million, $4 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and\nthe remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the consummation of the merger. The Company has\n58\nTable of Contents\nalso agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst\nPartners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners\nor any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or arising out of\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.",

At the effective time, each outstanding Company option, whether vested or unvested, will, automatically and without any required\naction on the part of the holder thereof, fully vest and be converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30\ndays) following the effective time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to the Company\noption immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the merger consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of\nsuch Company option. Any Company option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration will be cancelled\nat the effective time for no consideration or payment.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company RSU award, will, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the RSU payment. The RSU payment will be subject to the same time-based vesting\nand forfeiture provisions as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU award immediately prior to the effective time.\nPerformance Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company PSU award, will, automatically and without any required action\non the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the PSU payment. The PSU payment will be subject to the same time-vesting and\nforfeiture provisions, but not performance-vesting provisions, as were applicable to such Company PSU award immediately prior to the effective time.\nDeferred Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each outstanding Company DSU award will, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than 30 calendar days)\nfollowing the effective time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company DSU award\nmultiplied by (ii) the merger consideration.\nTreatment of ESPP. The merger agreement provides that the offering period under the ESPP in effect on the date of the merger agreement will end on\nthe earlier of (x) the next scheduled purchase date, which is November 14, 2022, or (y) no later than the business day preceding the closing date, and no\nadditional offering periods will commence thereafter.\nQuantification of Payments for Executive Officers. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers on settlement of their unvested Company equity awards, see\n59Table of Contents\n\u201c\u2014 Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below. The estimated aggregate amount that would be\npayable to iRobot\u2019s two executive officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of their unvested equity-based awards if the effective time\noccurred on July 31, 2022 is $4,303,245. Vested Company Options are included in the table under \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and\nManagement\u201d below.\nQuantification of Payments for Non-Employee Directors. As of July 31, 2022, each non-employee director held 4,937 unvested restricted stock\nunits other than Ms. Golz, who held 6,285 unvested restricted stock units. All such restricted stock units held by non-employee directors will accelerate\nand fully vest on the closing date. As a result, we estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to the Company\u2019s seven non-employee\ndirectors for their unvested Company equity-based awards if the effective time occurred on July 31, 2022 is $2,190,327. In addition, Mr. Ali held\napproximately 6,314.19 Company DSU Awards under our Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Program as of July 31, 2022, with an estimated\nvalue of $385,166. As of July 31, 2022, none of our non-employee directors held any Company options.\nTransaction Bonus Program and Retention Bonus Program\nPursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash transaction bonus program providing for transaction bonuses in an aggregate\namount not to exceed $12 million (the \u201cTransaction Bonus Program\u201d). Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program vest and become payable as follows:\n(i) 25% on the six-month anniversary of the date of the merger agreement, (ii) 25% on the closing of the merger and (iii) 50% on the three-month\nanniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment through the applicable payment date\u037e provided, however, if an\nemployee\u2019s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the full amount of the bonus\npayable to such employee under the Transaction Bonus Program has been paid, the unpaid portion of the bonus shall, subject to the employee\u2019s\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, become payable to such employee.\nIn addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, iRobot may establish a cash retention bonus program providing for retention bonuses in an\naggregate amount not to exceed $12 million (the \u201cRetention Bonus Program\u201d). Awards under the Retention Bonus Program will vest and become payable\non the six-month anniversary of the closing of the merger, subject to the employee\u2019s continued employment through such date\u037e provided, however, if an\nemployee\u2019s employment is terminated by iRobot without cause on or after the closing of the merger and prior to the date that the bonus payable to such\nemployee under the Retention Bonus Program has been paid, the bonus shall, subject to the employee\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a general\nrelease of claims, become payable to such employee.\nAwards under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program will be determined by iRobot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and\nExecutive Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Communications, after reasonable consultation with Amazon.com. No employee is eligible to\nreceive a bonus under both the Transaction Bous Program and the Retention Bonus Program. No bonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or\nthe Retention Bonus Program may exceed 100% of the applicable employee\u2019s base salary. iRobot\u2019s Chief Executive Officer is not eligible to receive a\nbonus under either the Transaction Bonus Program or the Retention Bonus Program. iRobot\u2019s other executive officers are eligible to receive bonuses\nunder the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program and the aggregate amount of the bonuses the executive officers are eligible to\nreceive under the Transaction Bonus Program and the Retention Bonus Program is $2,240,000, including bonuses to the named executive officers as\ndescribed in the Golden Parachute Compensation Table below.\nExecutive Agreements\nEach of iRobot\u2019s executive officers is party to an executive agreement with iRobot that provides for severance benefits upon a termination of\nemployment by iRobot other than for cause within the period beginning\n60\nTable of Contents\non the date that is 45 days prior to the date of the public announcement of the execution of a definitive agreement for a change in control and ending on\nthe first anniversary of the effective date of a change in control, or if such executive officer resigns for good reason during the one-year period following\nthe effective date of a change in control (collectively, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d). The merger will qualify as a \u201cchange in control\u201d within the meaning of\neach executive agreement, and each executive officer is eligible to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination:\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards held by such executive officer as of the date of the termination of employment or, if later,\nthe date of announcement of the change in control\u037e\n\u2022\nan amount equal to 200% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary at the highest annualized rate in effect during the period between\nimmediately prior to the effective date of the change in control and the date of termination of employment\u037e\n\u2022\nan amount equal to 200% of the executive officer\u2019s highest target cash incentive compensation with respect to the period beginning in the\nyear prior to the year in which the effective date of the change in control occurs and ending in the year in which the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment terminates\u037e and\n\u2022\nin the event that the executive officer elects continued health, vision and/or dental coverage under COBRA, payment of the portion of\nmonthly premium payments that iRobot pays for active employees for continued health, dental and vision benefits until the earliest of (a)\nthe second anniversary of the termination date, (b) the date on which the executive officer becomes covered under a comparable group plan\nfor such coverage, and (c) the date on which the executive officer ceases to be eligible for COBRA continuation for such coverage.\nThese severance payments and benefits under the executive agreements are subject to, among other things, the executive officer\u2019s execution of a\nseparation agreement, including a general release of claims, in a form and of a scope reasonably acceptable to iRobot and the executive officer\u2019s\ncontinued compliance with any noncompetition, inventions and/or nondisclosure obligations owed to iRobot. The executive agreements also provide\nthat payments and benefits payable to each executive officer will be reduced so that no portion of such payments and benefits are subject to the excise\ntax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), unless the executive officer would be better off on an after-tax\nbasis receiving all such payments and benefits.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to iRobot\u2019s named executive officers upon a\nqualifying termination in connection with the merger, see \u201c\u2014 Quantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d\nbelow. The estimated aggregate amount (excluding the value of accelerated vesting of unvested equity awards, which is described in \u201c\u2014 Treatment of\nCompany Equity Awards\u201d above) that would be payable to the Company\u2019s two executive officers who are not named executive officers under the\nexecutive agreements if they were to experience a qualifying termination on July 31, 2022 is $2,890,520.\nNew Arrangements with iRobot Executive Officers\nOn August 4, 2022, Mr. Angle entered into a letter agreement with Amazon.com Services LLC (\u201cAmazon.com Services\u201d) pursuant to which Mr.\nAngle will serve as CEO, iRobot Corporation, effective as of the closing date of the transaction (the \u201cStart Date\u201d). The letter agreement amends the\nexecutive agreement by and between Mr. Angle and the Company described under \u201cExecutive Agreements\u201d above (the \u201cAngle Executive Agreement\u201d).\nUnder the letter agreement, Mr. Angle\u2019s employment will be at-will and he will be entitled to an annual base salary of $350,000. Additionally, Mr. Angle is\neligible for a sign-on payment in the aggregate amount of $2,795,000, of which (i) $2,150,000 will be payable in equal pay period installments during the\none-year period following the Start Date, and (ii) the remaining $645,000 will be payable in equal pay period installments during the one-year period\nfollowing the first anniversary of the Start Date, in each case, subject to continued employment with Amazon.com Services through each such payment\ndate. If Mr. Angle\u2019s employment with Amazon.com Services is terminated for any reason prior to any applicable payment date, he will receive one final\npayment based on the days he worked in his final pay period.\n61\nTable of Contents\nSubject to approval by the board of directors of Amazon.com, Mr. Angle will be granted a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of\nAmazon.com common stock valued at $5,810,500 (the \u201cNew Hire RSU Award\u201d). The number of restricted stock units subject to the New Hire RSU Award\nwill be calculated based on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon.com common stock on the last trading day of the week prior to the\nclosing date and rounded to the nearest whole number. The New Hire RSU Award will vest and convert into shares of Amazon.com common stock over\nthe following vesting schedule, subject to Mr. Angle\u2019s continued employment with Amazon.com Services through each applicable vesting date:\n\u2022\n13% on the 15th day of the month in which the 18-month anniversary of the Start Date occurs,\n\u2022\n13% on the 15th day of the month in which the 24-month anniversary of the Start Date occurs, and\n\u2022\n9.25% on the 15th day of the month in which each of the 27-month, 30-month, 33-month, 36-month, 39-month, 42-month, 45-month and 48-\nmonth anniversaries of the Start Date occur.\nAdditionally, following the closing date and subject to the approval of the board of directors of Amazon.com, Mr. Angle will be granted a restricted\nstock unit award with respect to shares of Amazon.com common stock valued at $20,000,000 (the \u201cDeal RSU Award\u201d). The number of restricted stock\nunits subject to Mr. Angle\u2019s Deal RSU Award will be calculated based on the 30-trading-day trailing average closing price of Amazon.com common stock\non the last trading day of the week prior to the closing date and rounded to the nearest whole number. The Deal RSU Award will vest and convert into\nshares of Amazon.com common stock over the following vesting schedule, subject to your continued employment with Amazon.com Services through\neach applicable vesting date:\n\u2022\n15% on the 15th day of the month in which the first anniversary of the Start Date occurs,\n\u2022\n5% on the 15th day of the month in which the second anniversary of the Start Date occurs,\n\u2022\n55% on the 15th day of the month in which the third anniversary of the Start Date occurs, and\n\u2022\n25% on the 15th day of the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Start Date occurs.\nThe letter agreement also provides that, effective as of the closing date, the Angle Executive Agreement is amended such that (i) Mr. Angle waives\nany right he may have to terminate his employment on or following the Start Date for a Resignation for Good Reason Upon a Change in Control (as\ndefined in the Angle Executive Agreement) solely as a result of any changes occurring as a result of the closing of the merger agreement or any changes\nset forth in the letter agreement (including without limitation Mr. Angle\u2019s new compensation package, benefits, title, and associated responsibilities,\nauthority or duties) and such definition of Good Reason Upon a Change of Control is amended to reflect the foregoing, (ii) the New Hire RSU Award, the\nDeal RSU Award and any other equity-based awards granted to Mr. Angle by Amazon.com following the Start Date shall not be subject to accelerated\nvesting or continuing vesting upon termination of Mr. Angle\u2019s employment for any reason, and (iii) any equity-based awards granted to Mr. Angle by the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries between the date of the merger agreement and the closing date that remain unvested as of the closing date shall be\nforfeited for no consideration, effective as of the closing date. In the event of an Involuntary Termination Upon a Change in Control (as defined in the\nAngle Executive Agreement) or a Resignation for Good Reason Upon a Change in Control (as such definition in the Angle Executive Agreement is\nmodified by the letter agreement), Mr. Angle shall remain eligible to receive the severance and other termination benefits under the Angle Executive\nAgreement (as modified by the letter agreement). Upon the first anniversary of the closing date, the Angle Executive Agreement\u2019s Term (as defined in\nsuch agreement) shall end pursuant to the Angle Executive Agreement without having any impact on Mr. Angle\u2019s employment with Amazon.com\nServices.\nThe letter agreement also provides that Mr. Angle\u2019s employment is conditioned on him executing a Confidentiality and Invention Assignment\nAgreement, which Mr. Angle executed on August 4, 2022.\n62\nTable of Contents\nIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance\nThe merger agreement provides that after the effective time, Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the\nindividuals who on or prior to the effective time were officers or directors of iRobot or its subsidiaries or were serving at the request of iRobot as an\nofficer, director, member, trustee or fiduciary of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise with\nrespect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries at any time prior to the\neffective time to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including with respect to advancement of expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees and advancing\nsuch expenses and fees without requiring any preliminary determination of entitlement subject to such individual\u2019s affirmation or undertaking if required\nunder the DGCL).\nAmazon.com and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time\nexisting as of August 4, 2022 in favor of the current and former directors and officers of iRobot or any of its subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and\nthe heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director, as provided in iRobot\u2019s or each of its subsidiaries\u2019 respective\ncertificates of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) or in any agreement, will survive the merger and the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The merger agreement provides that after\nthe effective time, Amazon.com and the surviving corporation will (and Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to) fulfill and honor such\nobligations to the maximum extent that iRobot or the applicable subsidiary would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by applicable law.\nIn addition, for a period of six years following the effective time, the merger agreement provides that Amazon.com will, and will cause the surviving\ncorporation and its subsidiaries to, cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the surviving\ncorporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification\nand exculpation provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of iRobot and its subsidiaries\nimmediately prior to the effective time, and during such six-year period, such provisions may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any\nrespect, except as required by applicable law.\nIn addition, iRobot will obtain, or Amazon.com will cause the surviving corporation to obtain, for a period of six years from and after the effective\ntime, \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies for the extension of (1) the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability coverage of iRobot\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance\npolicies and (2) iRobot\u2019s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable\nto the insured parties as iRobot\u2019s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, subject to certain\nqualifications and provided that in no event will the annual cost of such insurance coverage exceed during such period 300% of the current aggregate\nannual premium paid by iRobot for such purpose and, if the cost of the insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the surviving corporation will obtain a\npolicy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to the Company\u2019s Named Executive Officers\nThe Golden Parachute Compensation table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of the Company\u2019s named executive\nofficers would receive in connection with the merger, assuming that the merger were consummated and each such executive officer experienced a\nqualifying termination on July 31, 2022 . The amounts below are determined using the merger consideration per share of Company common stock of\n$61.00, and are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions\ndescribed in the footnotes to the table. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer\nmay materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Clearances\nHSR Clearance. Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until\nnotifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust\n67Table of Contents\nDivision (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) of the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and all\nstatutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable\nwaiting period under the HSR Act. The merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period, which begins when\nAmazon.com and iRobot file Premerger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, unless such waiting\nperiod is earlier terminated by the Antitrust Division and the FTC. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the Antitrust\nDivision or FTC issues a request for additional information or documentary material (a \u201cSecond Request\u201d) from Amazon.com and iRobot, the waiting\nperiod with respect to the merger would be extended until the 30th calendar day following the date of the parties\u2019 substantial compliance with the second\nrequest. After that time, absent the agreement of Amazon.com and iRobot, the acquisition can be blocked only by court order. The Antitrust Division and\nthe FTC may terminate the applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration and the parties may agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay\nconsummation of the Merger for a specified period of time.\nAt any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action\nunder the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or to require one or both of the parties to divest assets, license or hold\nseparate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or to agree to other remedies.\nIn addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest,\nincluding seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or to require one or both of the parties to divest assets, license or hold separate assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or to agree to other remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust\nlaws under some circumstances.\nOther Regulatory Clearances. Merger control filings or clearances are required or advisable in other jurisdictions, including clearance by the\nEuropean Commission. The merger cannot be consummated until after the mandatory approval requirements outside of the United States have been\nobtained under applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. The relevant authorities could take such actions under the applicable antitrust and\nforeign investment laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial\nassets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or\nrequiring the parties to agree to other remedies. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay\nthe completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger.\nAlthough Amazon.com and iRobot believe that the merger will not violate the antitrust or foreign investment laws and expect that all required\nregulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, Amazon.com and iRobot cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be\ntimely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions,\nrestrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the merger, including the requirement to divest assets, license or hold\nseparate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other remedies, or require changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, or that a challenge to the merger on antitrust or foreign investment grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, what the result will\nbe. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take\nto obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time\nbetween the approval of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement by stockholders and the completion of the merger.",

        "Section Text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF IROBOT STOCKHOLDERS\nIf the merger is consummated, iRobot stockholders or beneficial owners who continuously hold their shares of iRobot common stock through the\neffective date of the merger, who do not vote in favor of the merger, who properly demand in writing an appraisal of their shares delivered to the Company\nprior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and who comply with, and do not validly withdraw their\ndemands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions of Delaware law will be entitled to appraisal rights to receive, in cash, the\nfair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d).\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full\ntext of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any\nlegal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that iRobot stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references\nin Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of iRobot common stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein,\nand all such references to a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d mean a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on\nbehalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted herein.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners who: (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their\nshares to iRobot prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the merger\u037e (iii)\ncontinuously hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, such shares through the effective date of the merger\u037e and (iv) otherwise comply with, and\ndo not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under, the applicable provisions set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be \u201cfair value.\u201d However, assuming shares of iRobot common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the\nmerger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as\nto all iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of iRobot common stock (as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262) or (b) the value of the\nconsideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b), and the assumption that shares of iRobot\ncommon stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the merger, are referred to in this summary as the \u201cownership\nthresholds\u201d).\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty\n(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the\nstockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement\nconstitutes iRobot\u2019s notice to iRobot stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be\naccessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In\nconnection with the merger, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its\nright to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the\nloss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nmerger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal\nof shares of iRobot common stock, iRobot believes that if a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner considers exercising such rights, that person should\nseek the advice of legal counsel.\n100Table of Contents\niRobot stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of iRobot common stock must do ALL\nof the following:\n\u2022\nthe person must not vote in favor of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must deliver to iRobot a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger\nagreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective\ndate of the merger (if a stockholder or beneficial owner transfers the shares before the effective time, such person will lose appraisal rights\nwith respect to the shares so transferred)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal or the surviving corporation must file a petition\nin the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after\nthe effective date of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe person must otherwise comply with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nMaking a Written Demand\nAny iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to iRobot, before the vote is taken on the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement, a written demand for the appraisal of the iRobot stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s shares. The person making\nthe written demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for appraisal is made, and such\nperson must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which such demand relates through the effective date of the merger.\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement. In the\ncase of a holder of record of iRobot common stock, a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in\nfavor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the iRobot stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify\nany previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a iRobot stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights\nmust ensure that the proxy submitted contains instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting. In\nthe case of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have\ndiscretionary authority to vote those shares on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement without specific voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the beneficial owner provides such\ninstructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d instructs such person\u2019s broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person\u2019s shares in\nfavor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to approve and\nadopt the merger agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver\nof such beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a beneficial owner who\nwishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such person\u2019s broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal\nto approve and adopt the merger agreement or must instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the approval and adoption of the merger\nagreement or abstain from voting on such proposal.\nNeither voting against the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting on such proposal will, in and of itself,\nconstitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\n101\nTable of Contents\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the\nmerger agreement. A iRobot stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to\napprove and adopt the merger agreement will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nA demand for appraisal made by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record or beneficial\nowner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform iRobot of the identity of such stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for\nappraisal made by a iRobot beneficial owner, the demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made,\nbe accompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner\u2019s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing\nsuch information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by\nthe surviving corporation under Section 262 and to be set forth on the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262 (discussed further below).\nWhether made by an iRobot stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for appraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand\nappraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary or representative\ncapacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand should be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner, and\nif the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more\njoint stockholders or beneficial owners, as applicable, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner\u037e however,\nthe agent must identify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for such record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, as applicable.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\niRobot Corporation\n8 Crosby Drive\nBedford, MA 01730\nAttention: Secretary\nAny iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who has delivered a written demand to iRobot and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and accept the\nmerger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to iRobot a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the\nmerger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nperson without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and to accept the merger\nconsideration with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each iRobot stockholder\nwho has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant\n102\nTable of Contents\nto Section 262 and has not voted in favor of the merger, and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal in such person\u2019s name pursuant to\nSection 262, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation or any iRobot stockholder or beneficial\nowner who has demanded appraisal of such person\u2019s shares and otherwise complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares held by\nall persons entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and iRobot\nstockholders and beneficial owners should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock. Accordingly, any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who desires to have their shares appraised\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of iRobot common stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner to file such a petition within the period\nspecified in Section 262 could nullify the person\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and\nwho is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the\naggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which iRobot has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such\nperson\u2019s name, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate\nnumber). Such statement must be given by the surviving corporation to the requesting person within ten (10) days after receipt by the surviving\ncorporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,\nwhichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the\nsurviving corporation, which will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly\nverified list (which we refer to in this summary as the \u201cverified list\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for\ntheir shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation and all persons shown on\nthe verified list at the addresses stated therein. The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving corporation. After notice to iRobot stockholders\nand beneficial owners as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those\npersons who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require\nthe persons who demanded an appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation\nthereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any person fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss\nthe proceedings as to such person. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all iRobot stockholders and beneficial\nowners who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then all\niRobot stockholders\u2019 and beneficial owners\u2019 right to an appraisal will cease.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\n103\nTable of Contents\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of iRobot common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the \u201cfair value.\u201d Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the\nmerger through the date of payment of the judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date the judgment is paid. However, at any\ntime before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) any interest\naccrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary\ncash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nIn determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining \u201cfair value\u201d in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of\nvalue by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Supreme Court of\nDelaware stated that, in making this determination of \u201cfair value,\u201d the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the\nnature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Delaware Court of Chancery may\nconsider in determining fair value and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction price should be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d Section\n262 provides that \u201cfair value\u201d is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d\nbut which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of\nDelaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\niRobot stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262. No representation is made\nas to the outcome of the appraisal of \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration.\nNeither iRobot nor Amazon.com anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights, and each of iRobot and\nAmazon.com reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding,\nthat for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of iRobot common stock is less than the merger consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name\nappears on the verified list may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights. When\nthe fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment\n104\nTable of Contents\nof such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled thereto and upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may\norder. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced. The costs of the\nappraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name\nappears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also\norder that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro\nrata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 262(k). In the\nabsence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares\nwill be entitled to vote such shares of iRobot common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock,\nexcept dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of iRobot common stock, if any, payable to iRobot stockholders as of a time prior to the\neffective time. If any iRobot stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of iRobot common stock under Section 262\nvalidly withdraws, fails to perfect, or otherwise loses, such holder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of iRobot common\nstock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration. A person will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, his, her or its right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the\nmerger or if neither of the ownership thresholds is met. As described above, a person may validly withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal if the\nperson delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares in\naccordance with Section 262.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any iRobot\nstockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\nENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the iRobot stockholders and beneficial owners to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not\npurport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by such persons to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of\nthe DGCL.\n105\nTable of Contents",

and the\nfailure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law\u037e provided, that the Company Board shall not\ntake any action set forth above unless and until (1) the Company has given Parent written notice of its intention to take such action five (5) Business\nDays in advance, which notice shall comply with the provisions of Section

inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law)\u037e and (3) at the end of the five (5)\nBusiness Day period and prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has considered in good faith any such binding written offer to make\nrevisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information it deems appropriate in good faith, and has determined in good\nfaith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its outside financial advisor, that in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal\ncontinues to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of a Change of Recommendation not involving an Acquisition Proposal, that the failure to\neffect a Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable Law) if such changes proposed in\nsuch binding offer by Parent were to be given effect.
