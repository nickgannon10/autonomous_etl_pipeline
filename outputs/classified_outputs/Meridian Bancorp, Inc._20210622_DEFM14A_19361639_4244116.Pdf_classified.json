You should read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares of common\nstock voted by proxy without attending your meeting. Your vote is important and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.\n \nQ.\nWhat will Meridian\u2019s stockholders receive in the merger?\n \nA.\nIn the merger, Meridian stockholders will receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common stock held\nimmediately prior to the completion of the merger.\nIndependent\u2019s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol \u201cINDB.\u201d Independent will not issue fractional\nshares of its common stock in the merger, but will instead pay cash for any fractional shares at a price determined by the volume weighted average\nclosing price of Independent common stock on NASDAQ for the five trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the\nclosing date of the merger, which is referred to herein as the Closing VWAP (the exchange ratio, together with cash received in lieu of fractional\nshares of Independent common stock, if any, the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d).\n \n2\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhat will Independent\u2019s shareholders receive in the merger?\n \nA.\nIn the merger, Independent shareholders will not receive any consideration, and their shares of Independent common stock will remain outstanding\nand will constitute shares of Independent following the merger. Following the merger, shares of Independent common stock will continue to be\nlisted on NASDAQ under the trading symbol \u201cINDB.\u201d\n \nQ.\nWhat will happen in the merger?\n \nA.\nIn the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meridian, with Meridian as the surviving entity. In the holdco merger, which will occur as soon\nas reasonably practicable following the merger, Meridian will merge with and into Independent, with Independent as the surviving entity. In the\nbank merger, which will occur immediately following the holdco merger, East Boston will merge with and into Rockland Trust, with Rockland Trust\nas the surviving bank.\nEach share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares held as\ntreasury stock or shares owned directly by Independent in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like) will be converted into the right to\nreceive 0.275 (the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d) of a share of Independent common stock. After completion of the merger, (1) Meridian will no longer be a public\ncompany, (2) Meridian common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and will cease to be publicly traded, and (3) the Meridian common stock will\nbe deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). After completion of the holdco merger, Meridian will\ncease to exist. Holders of Independent common stock will continue to own their existing shares of Independent common stock. See the information\nprovided in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Structure of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 100 and the merger agreement for more\ninformation about the merger.\n \nQ.\nHow will the merger affect Meridian equity awards?\n \nA.\nThe merger agreement provides that Meridian equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:\nStock Options. Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, will fully vest and be cancelled at the effective time of the merger. On the\nclosing date of the merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount equal to the product of\n(i) the number of shares of Meridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the per\nshare cash equivalent consideration (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the exercise price per share\nof Meridian common stock provided for in such stock option exceeds the per share cash equivalent consideration will be cancelled at the\neffective time of the merger without payment. The cash payment will be paid within five business days after the closing date of the merger,\nwithout interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of the merger agreement, \u201cper share cash equivalent consideration\u201d\nmeans the product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the exchange ratio by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading\nprice of a share of the Independent common stock on Nasdaq for the consecutive period of five full trading days ending on the day\nimmediately preceding the closing date.\nRestricted Stock Awards. Each share of restricted stock will fully vest at the effective time of the merger and be considered an outstanding\nshare of Meridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be issued within five business\ndays after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.\n \nQ.\nHow will the merger affect the East Boston ESOP?\n \nA.\nThe East Boston Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (which we refer to as the East Boston ESOP) will be terminated at least five\nbusiness days and no more than seven business days prior to the effective time of the merger. The East Boston ESOP is funded through a loan to\npurchase shares of Meridian\n \n3\nTable of Contents\n \ncommon stock, which shares are allocated to participants as the loan is repaid. The unallocated shares are held in a separate unallocated stock\nfund. Participants\u2019 account balances will become fully vested in connection with the termination of the East Boston ESOP. On the date the East\nBoston ESOP is terminated, East Boston will direct the trustee of the East Boston ESOP to remit a sufficient number of shares of Meridian common\nstock held in the ESOP loan suspense account back to East Boston to repay the outstanding ESOP loan in full. All remaining shares of Meridian\ncommon stock held by the East Boston ESOP as of immediately prior to the effective time, including any unallocated shares held in the East Boston\nESOP loan suspense account (which will not include any shares of Meridian common stock used for purposes of repaying or forgiving the East\nBoston ESOP loan) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. Following the effective time, the unallocated merger\nconsideration (and any other remaining unallocated assets) will be allocated on a pro rata basis to all participants with an account balance under\nthe East Boston ESOP based on each participant\u2019s account balance on the termination date.\n \nQ.\nWill the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the time the merger is\ncompleted?\n \nA.\nYes. Although the number of shares of Independent common stock that Meridian stockholders will receive is fixed, the value of the merger\nconsideration will fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the merger based upon the market\nvalue for Independent common stock. Any fluctuation in the market price of Independent common stock will change the value of the shares of\nIndependent common stock that Meridian stockholders will receive. Neither Independent nor Meridian is permitted to terminate the merger\nagreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of Independent common stock or Meridian common stock.\n \nQ.\nAre Meridian\u2019s stockholders or Independent\u2019s shareholders entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights?\n \nA.\nNo. Under the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, Meridian stockholders are not entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights in the\nmerger. Under the provisions of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, Chapter 156D, Section 13, Independent shareholders are not entitled\nto dissenters\u2019 rights in the merger.\n \nQ.\nAre there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the Independent share issuance proposal, the approval of\nthe Meridian merger proposal, or the other proposals to be considered at the Independent special meeting and the Meridian special meeting,\nrespectively?\n \nA.\nYes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section in this document titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page 27.\nYou also should read and carefully consider the risk factors of Independent and Meridian contained in the documents that are incorporated by\nreference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n \nQ.\nShould Meridian\u2019s stockholders send in their stock certificates now?\n \nA.\nNo. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy. After the merger is completed, an exchange agent designated by Independent and\nreasonably acceptable to Meridian (the \u201cexchange agent\u201d) will send you instructions for exchanging Meridian stock certificates for the merger\nconsideration.\n \nQ.\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to U.S. holders of Meridian common stock?\n \nA.\nThe merger and the holdco merger, taken together, are intended to qualify, and the obligations of the parties to complete the merger are conditioned\nupon the receipt of a legal opinion from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger and the holdco merger, taken together, will qualify, as a\nreorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is referred to in this joint\n \n4\nTable of Contents\n \nproxy statement/prospectus as the Code. Meridian\u2019s stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss with respect to the Independent common\nstock that they receive in the merger, except with respect to any cash they receive in lieu of receiving a fractional share of Independent common\nstock. See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger and the Holdco Merger\u201d beginning on page 121 . This tax treatment\nmay not apply to all Meridian stockholders. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger and the holdco merger to Meridian\nstockholders can be complicated and will depend on the particular circumstances of each Meridian stockholder. Meridian stockholders should\nconsult their own tax advisor for a full understanding of the mergers\u2019 tax consequences that are particular to each stockholder.\n \nQ.\nWhat are the interests of Meridian\u2019s directors and executive officers in the merger, if any?\n \nA.\nIn considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Meridian, Meridian\u2019s stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive\nofficers of Meridian have interests in the merger and holdco merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meridian\u2019s other\nstockholders generally. These interests include rights of certain executive officers under their existing employment and change in control\nagreements\u037e rights of certain directors and executive officers to payments of their vested account balances under their existing supplemental\nretirement arrangements\u037e rights of certain executive officers under consulting agreements and an offer letter with Rockland Trust executed in\nconnection with the merger agreement\u037e rights under Meridian\u2019s equity-based benefit programs and awards, including the acceleration of vesting of\nstock options and restricted stock\u037e a 2021 pro-rata bonus\u037e a 2021 grant of restricted stock awards\u037e rights under the East Boston ESOP\u037e and rights to\ncontinued indemnification and insurance coverage by Independent after the merger for acts and omissions occurring before the merger. In addition,\nfollowing the merger, Independent will invite all of the independent directors serving on Meridian\u2019s board of directors immediately prior to the\nmerger to become members of a transition advisory board for two years following the closing. The board of directors of Meridian was aware of\nthese interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and related transactions.\n \nQ.\nWhen will the merger be completed?\n \nA.\nIndependent and Meridian expect the merger to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, neither Independent nor Meridian can predict the\nactual date on which the merger will be completed, or if the merger will be completed at all, because completion is subject to conditions and factors\noutside the control of both companies. Meridian must first obtain the approval of Meridian stockholders for the Meridian merger proposal, and\nIndependent must obtain approval of Independent shareholders for the Independent share issuance proposal. Independent and Meridian must also\nobtain necessary regulatory approvals and satisfy certain other closing conditions.\n \nQ.\nWhat are the conditions to complete the merger?\n \nA.\nThe obligations of Independent and Meridian to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions\ncontained in the merger agreement, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without\nthe imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition, the receipt of certain tax opinions, approval by Independent shareholders of the\nIndependent share issuance proposal and approval by Meridian stockholders of the Meridian merger proposal. For more information, see \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Complete the Merger\u201d beginning on page 115.\n \nQ.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\n \nA.\nIf the merger is not completed, holders of Meridian common stock will not receive any consideration for their shares of Meridian common stock in\nconnection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an independent public company, Meridian common stock will continue to be listed and\ntraded on NASDAQ, and Independent will not complete the issuance of shares of Independent common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. In\naddition, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, a termination\n \n5\nTable of Contents\n \nfee of $44,145,000 will be payable by either Independent or Meridian, as applicable. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d beginning on\npage 117 for a more detailed discussion of the circumstances under which a termination fee will be required to be paid.\n \nQ.\nWhere can I find more information about the companies?\n \nA.\nYou can find more information about Independent and Meridian from the various sources described under the section of this document titled\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 142.\n \nQ.\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\n \nA.\nA \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d occurs on an item when a nominee or intermediary is not permitted to vote on that item without instructions from the beneficial\nowner of the shares, and the beneficial owner fails to provide the nominee or intermediary with such instructions.\n \nQ.\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\n \nA.\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two (2) or more shareholders reside, unless contrary\ninstructions have been received, but only if the applicable shareholders provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each\nshareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for\nbeneficial owners of Independent common stock and Meridian common stock, as applicable, held through brokerage firms. If your family has\nmultiple accounts holding Independent common stock or Meridian common stock, as applicable, you may have already received a householding\nnotification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus promptly upon your written\nor oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQuestions and Answers About the Special Meeting of Meridian Stockholders\n \nQ.\nWhen and where will Meridian\u2019s stockholders meet?\n \nA.\nThe Meridian special meeting will be held at 67 Prospect Street, Peabody, Massachusetts 01960 on August 5, 2021 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time.\nEven if you plan to attend the Meridian special meeting, Meridian recommends that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that\nyour vote will be counted if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the applicable special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat matters are Meridian\u2019s stockholders being asked to approve at the Meridian special meeting pursuant to this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus?\n \nA.\nAt the Meridian special meeting, Meridian\u2019s stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n \n \n\u2022\n Meridian Proposal 1: The Meridian merger proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Meridian Proposal 2: The Meridian compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Meridian Proposal 3: The Meridian adjournment proposal.\nIn order to complete the merger, among other things, Meridian stockholders must approve the Meridian merger proposal. None of the approvals of\nthe Meridian compensation proposal or the Meridian adjournment proposal is a condition to the obligations of Independent or Meridian to\ncomplete the merger.\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhat does Meridian\u2019s board of directors recommend with respect to the three proposals?\n \nA.\nThe Meridian board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Meridian merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Meridian compensation\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Meridian adjournment proposal.\nIn considering the recommendations of the Meridian board of directors, Meridian stockholders should be aware that Meridian directors and\nexecutive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Meridian stockholders generally. For a\nmore complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Meridian\u2019s Executive\nOfficers and Directors in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 88.\n \nQ.\nWho is eligible to vote at the Meridian special meeting of stockholders?\n \nA.\nOnly holders of record of Meridian common stock at the close of business on June 17, 2021 which is the record date for the Meridian special\nmeeting of stockholders, are entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting.\nAttendance at the special meeting is not required to vote. See below and the section entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting of Meridian Stockholders\u2014\nVoting of Proxies\u201d beginning on page 46 for instructions on how to vote your shares of Meridian common stock without attending the Meridian\nspecial meeting.\n \nQ.\nHow many votes must be represented in person or by proxy at the Meridian special meeting to have a quorum?\n \nA.\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of Meridian common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting of stockholders,\npresent in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Meridian special meeting.\n \nQ.\nWhat vote by Meridian\u2019s stockholders is required to approve the Meridian special meeting proposals?\n \nA.\nMeridian Proposal 1: Meridian merger proposal. Approval of the Meridian merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the shares of Meridian common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote or other failure\nto vote will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nMeridian Proposal 2: Meridian compensation proposal. Approval of the Meridian compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast by Meridian stockholders. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote or other failure to vote will have no effect on\nthe outcome of the Meridian compensation proposal.\nMeridian Proposal 3: Meridian adjournment proposal. Whether or not a quorum will be present at the meeting, approval of the Meridian\nadjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by Meridian stockholders. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker\nnon-vote or other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the Meridian adjournment proposal.\n \nQ.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, merger-related compensation arrangements\nfor the Meridian named executive officers (i.e., the Meridian compensation proposal)?\n \nA.\nUnder Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) rules, Meridian is required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to Meridian\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger or\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\n \n7\nTable of Contents\nQ.\nWhat happens if Meridian stockholders do not approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, merger-related compensation arrangements for Meridian\u2019s\nnamed executive officers (i.e., the Meridian compensation proposal)?\n \nA.\nThe vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation arrangements for each of Meridian\u2019s named executive officers is separate\nand apart from the votes to approve the other proposals being presented at the Meridian special meeting. Because the vote on the proposal to\napprove the merger-related executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding upon Meridian or Independent before or\nfollowing the merger. Accordingly, the merger-related compensation will be paid to Meridian\u2019s named executive officers to the extent payable in\naccordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and other contractual arrangements even if Meridian stockholders do not approve the\nproposals to approve the merger-related executive compensation.\n \nQ.\nAre any Meridian stockholders already committed to vote in favor of any of the Meridian special meeting proposals?\n \nA.\nUnder voting agreements with Independent, each of Meridian\u2019s directors and executive officers who individually or jointly owns shares of Meridian\ncommon stock, acting solely in his or her capacity as a stockholder, has agreed to vote all of his or her Meridian common stock in favor of the\nMeridian merger agreement proposal. As of the record date for the Meridian special meeting of stockholders, the Meridian stockholders who are\nparties to the voting agreements with Independent collectively owned (with sole or shared voting power) approximately 3.55% of the Meridian\ncommon stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meridian special meeting.\n \nQ.\nHow may Meridian\u2019s stockholders vote their shares for the Meridian special meeting proposals presented in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus prior to the special meeting?\n \nA.\nShares Held of Record: If you are a stockholder of record of Meridian common stock as of the Meridian record date, you may submit your proxy\nbefore the Meridian special meeting in one of the following ways:\n \n \n\u2022\n by signing the enclosed proxy card and mailing it in the enclosed, prepaid and addressed envelope\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n by calling the toll-free number indicated on the accompanying proxy card and following the instructions, or\n \n \n\u2022\n by accessing the web page indicated on the accompanying proxy card and following the on-screen instructions.\nProxies submitted by mail must be received by the close of business on August 4, 2021.

        "Section Text": "Risks Related to the Merger\nBecause the market price of Independent common stock will fluctuate, Meridian stockholders cannot be sure of the trading price of the stock portion\nof the merger consideration they will receive.\nIn the merger, each share of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for certain shares owned by\nIndependent or Meridian, will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 of a share of Independent common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will\nnot be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Independent common stock or Meridian common stock. Changes in the price of Independent\ncommon stock between now and the time of the merger will affect the value that Meridian stockholders will receive in the merger. Neither Independent nor\nMeridian is permitted to terminate the merger agreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of Independent common stock or\nMeridian common stock.\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Meridian\u2019s and Independent\u2019s\nbusinesses, operations and prospects, the recent volatility in the prices of securities in global financial markets, including market prices of Meridian,\nIndependent and other banking companies, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory considerations, many of which are beyond Meridian\u2019s\nand Independent\u2019s control. Therefore, at the time of the Independent special meeting and the Meridian special meeting, Independent shareholders and\nMeridian stockholders will not know the market value of the consideration that Meridian stockholders will receive at the effective time. You should obtain\ncurrent market quotations for shares of Independent common stock and for shares of Meridian common stock.\nThe market price of Independent common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of\nMeridian common stock or Independent common stock.\nIn the merger, Meridian stockholders will become Independent shareholders. Independent\u2019s business differs from that of Meridian. Accordingly, the\nresults of operations of Independent and the market price of Independent common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors\ndifferent from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Independent and Meridian. For a discussion of the businesses of\nIndependent and Meridian and of certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 142.\n \n27Table of Contents\nThe fairness opinions rendered to the boards of directors of Meridian and Independent by the parties\u2019 respective financial advisors prior to the\nsigning of the merger agreement do not reflect changes in events or circumstances occurring after the respective dates of the opinions.\nThe opinions of Raymond James, financial advisor to Meridian, and of KBW, financial advisor to Independent, were each delivered on and dated April 22,\n2021. Neither opinion reflects changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date on which it was delivered, including changes to the operations\nand prospects of Meridian or Independent, changes in general market and economic conditions or other changes. Any of these changes may alter the\nrelative value of Meridian or Independent or the prices of shares of Meridian common stock or Independent common stock by the time the merger is\ncompleted. The opinions do not speak as of the date the merger will be completed or as of any date other than the dates of the respective opinions. For a\ndescription of the opinion of Meridian\u2019s financial advisor, please see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d For a description of the\nopinion of Independent\u2019s financial advisor, please see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Independent\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d\nMeridian will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Meridian and, consequently, on Independent.\nThese uncertainties may impair Meridian\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated, and could cause\ncustomers and others that deal with Meridian to seek to change existing business relationships with Meridian. Retention of certain employees may be\nchallenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Independent. If key\nemployees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Independent, Independent\u2019s\nbusiness following the merger could be harmed. In addition, the merger agreement restricts Meridian from taking certain actions without the consent of\nIndependent until the merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent Meridian from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the\ncompletion of the merger. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2013 Conduct of Business Pending the Merger\u201d of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants to which Meridian is subject.\nIndependent may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger, particularly if the integration of Independent\u2019s and Meridian\u2019s\nbusinesses is more difficult than expected.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Independent and Meridian. Independent may fail\nto realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected. Furthermore, any\nnumber of unanticipated adverse occurrences for either the business of Meridian or Independent may cause us to fail to realize some or all of the\nexpected benefits. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,\ndepositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Each of these issues might adversely affect Independent, Meridian or both\nduring the transition period, resulting in adverse effects on Independent following the merger. As a result, revenues may be lower than expected or costs\nmay be higher than expected and the overall benefits of the merger may not be as great as anticipated.\nSome of the directors and executive officers of Meridian may have interests and arrangements that may have influenced their decisions to support\nand recommend that you approve the merger.\nThe interests of some of the directors and executive officers of Meridian may be different from those of Meridian stockholders, and certain directors and\nexecutive officers of Meridian may be participants in arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to, those of Meridian stockholders, including\nagreements in settlement of obligations to such officers under a pre-existing employment agreement and change in control agreements,\n \n28\nTable of Contents\nemployment or consulting agreements with Rockland Trust, service on a post-closing transition advisory board and provisions in the merger agreement\nrelating to indemnification of directors and officers and insurance for directors and officers of Meridian for events occurring before the merger. These\ninterests are described in more detail in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Meridian\u2019s Executive\nOfficers and Directors in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 88.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the\nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of Independent and Meridian. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a\ncontinued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of Independent or Meridian, or the business operations of\nIndependent or Meridian are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of\nIndependent and Meridian may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, and\nthe Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Massachusetts Division of Banks and/or other regulators may impose additional requirements on Independent\nor Meridian that must be satisfied prior to completion of the merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.\nIndependent may be unable to retain Independent and/or Meridian personnel successfully after the merger is completed.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on Independent\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by\nIndependent and Meridian. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Independent or Meridian, as applicable, while the merger is\npending or with Independent after the merger is completed. If Independent and Meridian are unable to retain key employees, including management, who\nare critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Independent and Meridian could face disruptions in their operations,\nloss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the\nmerger, if key employees terminate their employment, Independent\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected, and management\u2019s attention may be\ndiverted from successfully integrating Independent and Meridian to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Independent\u2019s business to\nsuffer. In addition, Independent and Meridian may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary and the actual\npurchase price as well as the actual financial condition and results of operations of Independent after the merger may differ materially.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only\nand is not necessarily indicative of what Independent\u2019s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been\ncompleted on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflects adjustments, which are based upon\npreliminary estimates, to record the Meridian identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The\npurchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price\nand the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Meridian as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the actual purchase price may vary\nsignificantly from the purchase price used in preparing the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information in this document.\nAccordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more\ninformation, see \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements\u201d beginning on page 34.\n \n29\nTable of Contents\nIndependent and Meridian are expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.\nIndependent and Meridian have incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and\nclosing the merger. In addition, Independent will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as Independent integrates the Meridian\nbusiness, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs.\nThere can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these\ntransaction and integration costs over time. Independent and Meridian may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key\nemployees. Independent and Meridian will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to\nregulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable\nregardless of whether the merger is completed. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Fees and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 118.\nThe merger agreement limits Meridian\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that limit Meridian\u2019s ability to solicit, initiate, encourage or take any actions to facilitate competing third- party\nproposals to acquire all or substantially all of Meridian. These provisions, which include a $44,145,000 termination fee, payable under certain\ncircumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or substantially all of Meridian from\nconsidering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the\nmerger, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire Meridian than it might otherwise have\nproposed to pay.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer to receive than expected or may impose burdensome conditions that are not presently\nanticipated.\nBefore the merger may be completed, certain approvals or consents must be obtained from the various bank regulatory and other authorities of the United\nStates and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These governmental entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Massachusetts\nDivision of Banks, may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. While Independent and\nMeridian do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such\nconditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of Independent\nfollowing the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on Independent following the merger. Independent is not obligated to complete\nthe merger if the regulatory approvals received in connection with the completion of the merger include any conditions or restrictions that would\nconstitute a \u201cBurdensome Condition\u201d as defined in the merger agreement.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received or the timing of the approvals. For more information, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger\u201d of this joint proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 96.\nIf the merger is not consummated by April 22, 2022, either Independent or Meridian may choose not to proceed with the merger.\nEither Independent or Meridian may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been completed by April 22, 2022, unless the failure of the\nmerger to be completed has resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform its obligations.\n \n30\nTable of Contents\nThe shares of Independent common stock to be received by Meridian stockholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from the shares\nof Meridian common stock.\nThe rights associated with Meridian common stock are different from the rights associated with Independent common stock. See the section of this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cComparison of Rights of Shareholders of Independent and Stockholders of Meridian\u201d beginning on page 127 for a\nproxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cComparison of Rights of Shareholders of Independent and Stockholders of Meridian\u201d beginning on page 127 for a\ndiscussion of the different rights associated with Independent common stock.\nStockholders of Meridian will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nAs a result of the merger, the percentage ownership of every Meridian stockholder in the combined company will be smaller than the Meridian\nstockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of Meridian prior to the merger. Independent estimates that upon completion of the merger, current Meridian\nstockholders will own approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of Independent common stock, and current Independent shareholders will own\napproximately 70% of the outstanding shares of Independent common stock.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Meridian.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of Meridian may be adversely affected and Meridian will be subject to several risks, including the\nfollowing:\n \n \n\u2022\n Meridian may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Independent a termination fee of $44,145,000 under the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Meridian will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting,\nfinancial advisor and printing fees\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n under the merger agreement, Meridian is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completion of the merger,\nwhich may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Meridian\u2019s management, which could\notherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Meridian as an independent company.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, Meridian may experience negative reactions from its customers and employees. Meridian also could be subject\nto litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Meridian to perform its obligations under the\nmerger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Meridian cannot assure its stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not\nmaterially affect the business and financial results of Meridian.\nMeridian stockholders will not have dissenters\u2019 rights in the merger.\nDissenters\u2019 rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and\nto demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration\noffered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, a stockholder may not dissent\nfrom a merger as to shares that are listed on a national securities exchange at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice\nof the meeting of stockholders to vote upon the agreement of merger or consolidation.\nBecause Meridian common stock is listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date, and\nbecause the merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements\n \n31\nTable of Contents\nof the Maryland General Corporation Law, holders of Meridian common stock will not be entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights in the merger with respect to their\nshares of Meridian common stock.\nIndependent will be able to issue additional shares of its common stock in the future, which may adversely affect the market price of Independent\ncommon stock and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.\nIn the future, Independent may issue additional shares of Independent common stock in connection with another acquisition, to increase its capital\nresources or if Independent\u2019s or Rockland Trust\u2019s capital ratios fall below or near the Basel III regulatory required minimums. Additional common stock\nofferings may dilute the holdings of Independent\u2019s existing shareholders or reduce the market price of Independent common stock, or both. Independent\nmay also issue shares of Independent preferred stock, which may be viewed as having adverse effects upon the holders of common stock.\nLitigation related to the merger has been filed against Meridian, the Meridian board of directors and Independent, and additional litigation may be\nfiled against Meridian and the Meridian board of directors and/or Independent and the Independent board of directors, which could prevent or\ndelay the completion of the merger or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of Independent and Meridian.\nLitigation related to the merger has been filed against Meridian, the Meridian board of directors and Independent, and it is possible that additional\nlitigation by stockholders of Meridian and/or shareholders of Independent may be filed against Meridian and the Meridian board of directors and/or\nIndependent and the Independent board of directors in the future. One of the conditions to the closing is that no order, injunction or decree issued by\nany court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint preventing the consummation of the merger, the holdco merger, the\nbank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction\nprohibiting Independent or Meridian defendants from completing the merger, the holdco merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to\nIndependent and/or Meridian, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company. Independent and\nMeridian may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of the shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Such litigation\ncould have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Independent and Meridian and could prevent or delay the completion\nof the merger.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on Independent\u2019s business and operations following the completion of the merger is uncertain.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of\nIndependent following the completion of the merger will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including\nthe scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees, clients, counterparties and\nservice providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Independent\u2019s\nbusiness, and there is no guarantee that efforts by Independent to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, Independent may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic\u2019s global economic impact, including reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any\nrecession or depression that may occur.\n \n32\nTable of Contents",

The following unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined financial statements combines the historical consolidated financial position and results of operations of Independent and its\nsubsidiaries and Meridian and its subsidiaries, as an acquisition by Independent of Meridian using the acquisition method of accounting and giving\neffect to the related pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes.

The type and amount of actual\ncosts incurred could vary materially from these estimates if future developments differ from the underlying assumptions used by management in\ndetermining the current estimate of these costs.

The table also presents preliminary pro forma information for both companies on a per share basis.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined per share data set forth below gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020, the beginning of the\nearliest period presented, in the case of continuing net income per share data, and as of March 31, 2021, in the case of book value per share data,\nassuming that each outstanding share of Meridian common stock had been converted into shares of Independent common stock based on the exchange\nratio of 0.275 shares of Independent common stock for each share of Meridian common stock. The unaudited pro forma combined per share data has been\nderived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for each of Independent and Meridian as of and for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021 and the audited consolidated financial statements for each of Independent and Meridian as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe preliminary pro forma equivalent per share information shown for Meridian in the following table was obtained by multiplying the pro forma per share\namounts shown for Independent by the exchange ratio of 0.275. The actual number of shares to be issued by Independent in the merger will also depend\non the number of shares of Meridian common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger.\nThe preliminary pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments to record Meridian\u2019s assets and liabilities at their respective fair values\nbased on Independent\u2019s management\u2019s best estimate using the information available at this time. The preliminary pro forma adjustments may be revised\nas additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after\nthe merger is completed and after the completion of a final analysis to determine\n \n42\nTable of Contents\nthe fair values of Meridian\u2019s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the closing date. The final purchase price adjustments may\ndiffer materially from the preliminary pro forma adjustments. Increases or decreases in the fair value of certain balance sheet amounts and other items of\nMeridian as compared to the information presented in this document may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill and other assets\nand liabilities and may impact the statement of income due to adjustments in yield and/or amortization of adjusted assets and liabilities.\nIt is anticipated that the merger will provide Independent with financial benefits, such as possible expense efficiencies and revenue enhancements, among\nother factors, although no assurances can be given that these benefits will actually be achieved.

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor\nMeridian retained Raymond James as financial advisor on March 5, 2021. Meridian selected Raymond James as a financial advisor because it is a globally-\nrecognized investment banking firm offering a full range of investment banking services to its clients. In the ordinary course of its investment banking\nbusiness, Raymond James is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions\nand other corporate transactions. Pursuant to that engagement, the Meridian board of directors requested that Raymond James evaluate the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian\u2019s outstanding common stock (other than the Exception Shares) of the exchange ratio to be\nreceived by such holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.\nAt the April 22, 2021 meeting of the Meridian board of directors, representatives of Raymond James rendered its opinion, subsequently confirmed in\nwriting and dated April 22, 2021, to the Meridian board of directors (in its capacity as such), as to the fairness, as of such date, from a financial point of\nview, to the holders of Meridian\u2019s outstanding common stock (other than the Exception Shares) of the exchange ratio to be received by such holders in\nthe merger pursuant to the merger agreement, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Raymond James in connection with the preparation of its opinion.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Raymond James is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of the opinion of\nRaymond James set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such written opinion.\nHolders of Meridian common stock are urged to read this opinion in its entirety. The opinion of Raymond James speaks only as of the date of the\nopinion and does not reflect any developments that may occur or may have occurred after the date of its opinion and prior to the completion of the\nmerger.\nRaymond James provided its opinion for the information of the Meridian board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for purposes\nof, its consideration of the exchange ratio to be received by holders of Meridian\u2019s outstanding common stock (other than the Exception Shares) in the\nmerger pursuant to the merger agreement and its opinion only addresses whether the exchange ratio in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock (other than the Exception Shares). The opinion of Raymond James does not\naddress any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger contemplated thereby. The Raymond James opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation to the Meridian board of directors or to any holder of Meridian common stock as to how the\n \n62Table of Contents\nMeridian board of directors, such stockholder or any other person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the merger or any other matter. Raymond\nJames does not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of Independent common stock following the merger, which may vary depending on\nnumerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial condition of Independent at that time.\nIn connection with its review of the proposed merger and the preparation of its opinion, Raymond James, among other things:\n \n\u2022\n reviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Independent and\nMeridian dated as of April 21, 2021 (the \u201cmerger agreement\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n reviewed certain information related to the historical condition and prospects of Meridian and Independent, as made available to Raymond\nJames by or on behalf of Meridian, including, but not limited to, (a) financial projections for each of Meridian and Independent that were\nprepared using consensus analyst estimates for the years 2021 and 2022 with further years extrapolated based on appropriate growth rates,\nwhich were reviewed and approved for our use by the management of Meridian (together, the \u201cProjections\u201d) and (b) certain forecasts and\nestimates of potential cost savings, operating efficiencies, revenue effects, and other pro forma financial adjustments expected to result from\nthe merger, as approved and directed for our use by management of Meridian (the \u201cPro Forma Financial Adjustments\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n reviewed Meridian\u2019s and Independent\u2019s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and\nunaudited financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2021\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n reviewed Meridian\u2019s and Independent\u2019s recent public filings and certain other publicly available information regarding Meridian and\nIndependent\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n reviewed the financial and operating performance of Meridian and Independent and those of other selected public companies that Raymond\nJames deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n considered certain publicly available financial terms of certain transactions Raymond James deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n reviewed the then-current and historical market prices for shares of Meridian common stock and shares of Independent common stock, and\nthe then-current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that Raymond James deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as Raymond James\ndeemed appropriate\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n received a certificate addressed to Raymond James from a member of senior management of Meridian regarding, among other things, the\naccuracy of the information, data and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or discussed with, Raymond James by or on\nbehalf of Meridian\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n discussed with members of the senior management of Meridian certain information relating to the aforementioned and any other matters\nwhich Raymond James deemed relevant to its inquiry including, but not limited to, the past and then-current business operations of\nMeridian and the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Meridian.\nWith Meridian\u2019s consent, Raymond James assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by or on behalf of\nMeridian or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, and Raymond James did not undertake any duty or responsibility to, nor did\nRaymond James, independently verify any of such information. Furthermore, Raymond James undertook no independent analysis of any potential or\nactual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which Meridian or Independent was a party or may have\nbeen subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which Meridian or Independent\nwas a party or may become subject. With Meridian\u2019s consent, the opinion of Raymond James made no assumption concerning, and therefore\n \n63\nTable of Contents\ndid not consider, the potential effects of any such litigation, claims or investigations or possible assertions. Raymond James did not make or obtain an\nindependent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Meridian or Independent. With respect to the Projections, Pro Forma\nFinancial Adjustments, and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Raymond James, Raymond James,\nwith Meridian\u2019s consent, assumed that the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments and such other information and data were reasonably prepared\nin good faith on bases reflecting (or, in the case of the Projections with respect to 2021 and 2022, which were prepared using consensus analyst estimates\nfor the years 2021 and 2022, are consistent with) the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of management of Meridian, and Raymond\nJames relied upon Meridian to advise Raymond James promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated\nduring the period of its review. Raymond James expressed no opinion with respect to the Projections, the Pro Forma Financial Adjustments or the\nassumptions on which they were based. Raymond James assumed that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the draft\nreviewed by Raymond James, and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver or\namendment of any conditions thereto. Furthermore, Raymond James assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and\nwarranties of each party contained in the merger agreement were true and correct and that each such party would perform all of the covenants and\nagreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement without being waived. Raymond James relied upon and assumed, without\nindependent verification, that (i) the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable international, federal and\nstate statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the\nmerger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that\nwould have an effect on the merger, Independent or Meridian that would be material to its analyses or opinion.\nRaymond James expressed no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the merger, the structure or tax consequences of the merger, or the\navailability or advisability of any alternatives to the merger. Raymond James provided advice to the Meridian board of directors with respect to the\nproposed merger. Raymond James did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration or that any specific consideration constituted the\nonly appropriate consideration for the merger. Raymond James did not solicit indications of interest with respect to a transaction involving Meridian. The\nopinion of Raymond James did not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of Independent common stock following the merger, which may vary\ndepending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial condition of Independent at that time. The Raymond\nJames opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of Meridian common stock\n(other than the Exception Shares).\nRaymond James expressed no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Meridian\nboard of directors to approve or consummate the merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended by Raymond James on matters\nthat require legal, accounting or tax advice. Raymond James assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations had been or would be obtained from\nappropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Raymond James relied, with the consent of the Meridian board of directors, on the fact that Meridian was\nassisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors, and, with the consent of the Meridian board of directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the assessments by Meridian and its advisors, as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to Meridian and the merger,\nincluding, without limitation, that Meridian\u2019s and Independent\u2019s financial statements had been prepared in accordance with GAAP and that the merger\nwould qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Raymond James was not an\nexpert in the evaluation of allowances for loan and lease losses and had not independently verified such allowances or reviewed or examined any\nindividual loan or credit files. Raymond James assumed, with Meridian\u2019s consent, that the allowance for loan and lease losses (i) set forth in the\nrespective financial statements of Meridian and Independent were adequate to cover such losses, (ii) would be adequate on a pro forma basis for the\ncombined entity and (iii) complied fully with applicable law, regulatory policy and sound banking practices as of the date of such financial statements.\n \n64\nTable of Contents\nIn formulating its opinion, Raymond James considered only what it understood to be the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of Meridian\ncommon stock (other than the Exception Shares), and Raymond James did not consider, and did not express an opinion on, the fairness of the amount or\nnature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of Meridian\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, whether relative to the\ncompensation to be received by the holders of Meridian common stock (other than the Exception Shares) or otherwise. Raymond James was not\nrequested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the merger to the\nholders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Meridian, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in\nthe last sentence of its opinion or (2) the fairness of the merger to any one class or group of Meridian\u2019s or any other party\u2019s security holders or other\nconstituents vis-\u00e0-vis any other class or group of Meridian\u2019s or such other party\u2019s security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation,\nthe allocation of any consideration to be received in the merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents).\nRaymond James expressed no opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Meridian or Independent or the ability of Meridian or\nIndependent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nMaterial Financial Analyses\nThe following summarizes the material financial analyses reviewed by Raymond James with the Meridian board of directors at its meeting on April 22,\n2021, which material was considered by Raymond James in rendering its opinion. No company or transaction used in the analyses described below is\nidentical or directly comparable to Meridian, Independent or the contemplated merger.\nContribution Analysis. Raymond James analyzed the relative contribution of Meridian and Independent to certain financial and operating metrics for the\npro forma combined company resulting from the merger. The financial and operating metrics included: (i) market capitalization\u037e (ii) total assets\u037e (iii) gross\nloans\u037e (iv) non-interest bearing deposits\u037e (v) core deposits\u037e (vi) total deposits\u037e (vii) tangible common equity\u037e (viii) last twelve months net interest income\u037e\n(ix) last twelve months operating fee income\u037e (x) last twelve months net income\u037e (xi) consensus estimated 2021 net income\u037e and (xii) consensus estimated\n2022 net income. Forward net income estimates were based on median consensus estimates as shown by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The estimates\npublished by Wall Street research analysts were not prepared in connection with the merger or at the request of Raymond James and may or may not\nprove to be accurate. The relative contribution analysis did not give effect to any synergies as a result of the merger.

Raymond James performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Meridian and Independent based on the Projections.\nConsistent with the periods included in the Projections, Raymond James used estimated calendar year 2026 as the final year for the analysis and applied\nmultiples, ranging from 12.0x to 14.0x for Meridian and 18.0x to 22.0x for Independent, to estimated calendar year 2026 earnings in order to derive a range\nof estimated terminal values for Meridian and Independent in 2025.\nFor Independent, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from 10.1% to 12.1%. For Meridian, Raymond James used discount rates ranging from\n10.5% to 12.5%. Raymond James arrived at its discount rate ranges by using the 2020 Duff & Phelps Valuation Handbook. Raymond James reviewed the\nranges of implied per share values indicated by the discounted cash flow analysis for each of Independent and Meridian and calculated a range of implied\nexchange ratios by dividing the maximum implied per share value of Meridian common stock by the minimum implied per share value of Independent\ncommon stock to calculate the maximum implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the minimum implied per share value of Meridian common stock by the\nmaximum implied per share value of Independent common stock to calculate the minimum implied exchange ratio. The results of the discounted cash flow\nanalysis are summarized in the table below:\n \n \n  \nImplied Per Share Value\n \n  \nImplied\nExchange Ratio\n \n \n  \nIndependent    \nMeridian\n \n \n  \nLow    High    \nLow    High    Low/High    High/Low \nNet Income Terminal Multiple\n  $68.37   $85.70   $19.32   $22.46    \n0.225x  -  \n0.328x \nExchange Ratio in the Merger\n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n0.275x\n \nSelected Companies Analysis. Raymond James reviewed certain data for selected companies with publicly traded equity securities that it deemed relevant\nfor its analysis. The selected group represents companies Raymond James believed to be relevant to each of Independent and Meridian. Raymond James\nselected certain companies that: (i) are headquartered in New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont)\nor the Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania)\u037e (ii) have total assets between $8.0 billion and\n$20.0 billion for Independent and between $3.0 billion and $10.0 billion for Meridian\u037e (iii) have tangible common equity to tangible assets greater than\n7.00%\u037e (iv) have a most recent quarter return on average assets of greater than 1.00% for Independent and greater than 0.75% for Meridian\u037e and (v) are\ntraded on the NASDAQ or NYSE. The aforementioned financial characteristics were shown for the bank subsidiary if consolidated data was unavailable,\nand the financial characteristics were based on the most recent quarter period reported as of March 31, 2021, if available, otherwise for the quarter period\nreported as of December 31, 2020. The selected groups exclude mutual holding companies and targets of announced mergers. The Meridian selected\ngroup also excludes The Bancorp, Inc. due to its unique business model. No company used in the analysis described below is identical or directly\ncomparable to either Independent or Meridian.

The estimates published by Wall Street research analysts were\nnot prepared in connection with the Merger or at the request of Raymond James and may not prove to be accurate. Raymond James reviewed the median\nand the 100th percentile relative valuation multiples of the selected public companies for Independent and the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile\nrelative valuation multiples of the selected public companies for Meridian.

Raymond James reviewed\nthe ranges of implied per share values and calculated a range of implied exchange ratios by dividing the higher implied per share value of Meridian by the\nlower implied per share value of Independent to calculate the implied exchange ratio, and by dividing the lower implied per share value of Meridian by the\nhigher implied per share value of Independent to calculate the low implied exchange ratio.

For informational purposes only, Raymond James performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected\nbalance sheet and 2022 and 2023 estimated EPS information of Independent and Meridian. Using (i) closing balance sheet estimates as of December 31,\n2021 for each of Independent and Meridian\u037e (ii) financial forecasts and projections of each of Independent and Meridian for the year ending 2022 based\non consensus analyst estimates, which were authorized and reviewed by management of Meridian, and the year ending 2023, extrapolated based on\nappropriate growth rates, which were authorized and reviewed by management of Meridian\u037e and (iii) pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation,\nthe cost savings expected to result from the merger, as well as the purchase accounting adjustments), each of which were authorized and reviewed by\nmanagement of Meridian. Raymond James analyzed the estimated financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results. This analysis\nindicated that the merger could be accretive to Independent\u2019s estimated tangible book value per share at December 31, 2021, and accretive to\nIndependent\u2019s estimated 2022 and 2023 earnings per share. The analysis also indicated that the merger could be accretive to Meridian\u2019s estimated 2022\ndividend per share, as adjusted for the exchange ratio. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by the pro forma company following the\nmerger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.\nAdditional Considerations. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not susceptible to a partial analysis or summary\ndescription. Raymond James believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, without considering the\nanalyses taken as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In addition, Raymond James considered the results of\nall such analyses and did not assign relative weights to any of the analyses, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of\neach analysis and factor, so the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view of\nRaymond James as to the actual value of Meridian.\n \n69\nTable of Contents\nIn performing its analyses, Raymond James made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic and\nregulatory conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Meridian. The analyses performed by Raymond James are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values, trading values or actual future results which might be achieved, all of which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were provided to the Meridian board of directors (in its capacity as such) and were prepared\nsolely as part of the analysis of Raymond James of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Meridian common stock of the exchange\nratio in the proposed merger pursuant to the merger agreement. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies\nmay actually be sold, and such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty. The opinion of Raymond James was one of many factors taken into\naccount by the Meridian board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Neither Raymond James\u2019 opinion nor the analyses\ndescribed above should be viewed as determinative of the Meridian board of directors\u2019 or Meridian management\u2019s views with respect to Meridian,\nIndependent or the merger. Raymond James provided advice to Meridian with respect to the proposed merger. Raymond James did not, however,\nrecommend any specific amount of consideration to the Meridian board of directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration for the merger. Meridian placed no limits on the scope of the analysis performed, or opinion expressed, by Raymond James.\nThe Raymond James opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to it\nas of April 21, 2021, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect the opinion of Raymond James, but Raymond James does\nnot have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm that opinion. As the Meridian board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets\nhad been experiencing unusual volatility and Raymond James expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the merger,\nMeridian, or Independent and the Raymond James opinion did not purport to address potential developments in any such markets. As the Meridian\nboard of directors was aware, there was significant uncertainty as to the potential direct and indirect business, financial, legal, economic and social\nimplications and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses and the actions and measures that countries, governments,\nregulatory agencies, central banks, international financing and funding organizations, stock markets, businesses and individuals may take to address the\nspread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses including, without limitation, those actions and measures pertaining to fiscal or monetary policies,\nlegal and regulatory matters and the credit, financial and stock markets (collectively, the \u201cPandemic Effects\u201d). Raymond James expressed no opinion or\nview as to the potential impact of the Pandemic Effects on its analysis, its opinion, the merger, Meridian or Independent. Raymond James relied upon and\nassumed, without independent verification, that, other than as had been disclosed to Raymond James, there had been no change in the business, assets,\nliabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of Meridian of Independent since the respective dates of the most recent\nfinancial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to Raymond James that would be material to its analyses or its opinion, and\nthat there was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Raymond James incomplete or misleading in any material\nrespect.\nFor services rendered in connection with the delivery of its opinion, Meridian paid Raymond James a fee of $500,000 upon delivery of its opinion.\nMeridian will also pay Raymond James a customary fee for advisory services in connection with the merger equal to approximately $12.2 million (less the\nfee paid upon the delivery of the opinion), which is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Meridian also agreed to reimburse Raymond James for its\nexpenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and expenses of its counsel, and will indemnify Raymond James against certain\nliabilities arising out of its engagement.\nRaymond James is actively involved in the investment banking business and regularly undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection\nwith public offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of business, Raymond James may trade\nin the securities of Meridian and Independent for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or\nshort position in such securities. In the two year period preceding the date of its opinion letter, Raymond James did not receive any fees from Meridian. In\nthe two year period preceding the date of its opinion\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nletter, Raymond James engaged in fixed income trading activity with Independent and/or certain of its affiliates, for which is had earned income.\nFurthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to Meridian and/or Independent or other\nparticipants in the merger in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.\nRecommendation of Independent\u2019s Board of Directors\nIndependent\u2019s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Independent\u2019s shareholders vote\n\u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Independent share issuance proposal.",

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Independent\u2019s Financial Advisor\nIndependent engaged Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (\u201cKBW\u201d) to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Independent, including\nan opinion to the Independent board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Independent of the exchange ratio in the proposed\nmerger. Independent selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar\nto the transaction. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.\nAs part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Independent board held on April 22, 2021 at which the Independent\nboard evaluated the proposed transaction. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered an opinion to the\nIndependent board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to Independent. The Independent board approved the merger agreement at this meeting.\nThe description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this\ndocument and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and\nlimitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.\nKBW\u2019s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the Independent board (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the transaction. The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the merger to Independent. It did not address the underlying business decision of Independent to engage\nin the transaction or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Independent board in connection with the transaction, and\nit does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Independent common stock or any shareholder or stockholder of any other entity as to how to\nvote in connection with the transaction or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such shareholder or\nstockholder should enter into a voting, shareholders\u2019, affiliates\u2019 or other agreement with respect to the transaction or exercise any dissenters\u2019 or\nappraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder or stockholder.\n \n73Table of Contents\nKBW\u2019s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW\u2019s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and procedures established under the\nrequirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nIn connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition of Independent and\nMeridian and bearing upon the transaction, including, among other things:\n \n \n\u2022\n an execution version of the merger agreement, dated as of April 22, 2021\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Independent\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Independent (provided by\nIndependent)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Meridian\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Meridian (provided by Meridian)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n certain regulatory filings of Independent and Meridian and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and\nquarterly call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n certain other interim reports and other communications of Independent and Meridian to their respective shareholders or stockholders\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n other financial information concerning the respective businesses and operations of Independent and Meridian furnished to KBW by\nIndependent and Meridian or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of its analyses.\nKBW\u2019s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to its analyses included,\namong others, the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Independent and Meridian\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the assets and liabilities of Independent and Meridian\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Independent and Meridian with similar information for certain other\ncompanies, the securities of which were publicly traded\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n publicly-available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian, as well as assumed Independent long-term growth rates and\nfinancial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022 provided to KBW by Independent management, all\nof which information was discussed with KBW by such management and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such\nmanagement and with the consent of the Independent board\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the transaction on Independent (including without limitation the cost savings,\nrelated expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the transaction) that were prepared by, and provided to and\ndiscussed with KBW by, Independent management, and used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the\nconsent of the Independent board.\nconsent of the Independent board.\nKBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nas its experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions held by the managements\nof Independent and Meridian regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their\nrespective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry.\nIn conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other\ninformation that was provided to it or that was publicly available and KBW did not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any such\ninformation or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW relied upon Independent management as to the\nreasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian, the assumed Independent long-\nterm growth rates, the financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022, and the estimates regarding certain pro\nforma financial effects of the transaction on Independent (including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies\nexpected to result or be derived from the transaction), all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information), and KBW\nassumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented, or in the case of the Independent and Meridian \u201cstreet estimates\u201d referred to\nabove that such estimates were consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Independent management and that the forecasts,\nprojections and estimates reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.\nIt is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Independent and Meridian that was provided to KBW was not prepared with\nthe expectation of public disclosure and that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of\nIndependent and Meridian referred to above, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain (including, without\nlimitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions, and in particular, assumptions regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic)\nand, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions with the\nmanagement of Independent and with the consent of the Independent board, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW\ncould form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. Among other things, such\ninformation has assumed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact, which has been assumed to be limited, on Independent\nand Meridian. KBW relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or\nliability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.\nKBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of either\nIndependent or Meridian since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the\nindependent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with\nIndependent\u2019s consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Independent and Meridian are adequate to cover such losses. In\nrendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of Independent or Meridian, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW\nexamine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Independent or Meridian under any state or\nfederal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be\nappraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and\nshould not be taken as KBW\u2019s view of the actual value of any companies or assets.\nKBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:\n \n \n\u2022\n the transaction and any related transactions (including, without limitation, the bank merger) would be completed substantially in accordance\nwith the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any respect material to its\nanalyses from the execution\n \n75\nTable of Contents\n \nversion of the merger agreement reviewed by KBW and referred to above), with no adjustments to the exchange ratio and with no other\nconsideration or payments in respect of Meridian common stock\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the\nmerger agreement were true and correct\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n each party to the merger agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed\nby such party under such documents\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the\ntransaction or any related transactions and all conditions to the completion of the transaction and any related transactions would be\nsatisfied without any waivers or modifications to the merger agreement or any of the related documents\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the transaction and any related\ntransactions, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would\nbe imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Independent, Meridian or\nthe pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the transaction, including without limitation the cost savings, related expenses and\noperating synergies expected to result or be derived from the transaction.\nKBW assumed that the transaction would be consummated in a manner that complied with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW was further\nadvised by representatives of Independent that Independent relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all\nlegal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Independent, Meridian, the transaction and any related transaction and\nthe merger agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.\nKBW\u2019s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the exchange ratio in the merger to\nIndependent. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the transaction or any term or aspect of any related transaction\n(including the bank merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the transaction or any such related transaction, any consequences of\nthe transaction to Independent, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting,\nvoting, support, shareholder, charitable giving or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the\ntransaction, any such related transaction, or otherwise. KBW\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated\non the date of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. There has been widespread disruption, extraordinary\nuncertainty and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of evolving governmental interventions and\nnon-interventions. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW\u2019s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW\u2019s\nopinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. KBW\u2019s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed\nno view or opinion with respect to:\n \n \n\u2022\n the underlying business decision of Independent to engage in the transaction or enter into the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by\nIndependent or the Independent board\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any business, operational or other plans with respect to Meridian or the pro forma entity that may be contemplated by Independent or the\nIndependent board or that may be implemented by Independent or the Independent board subsequent to the closing of the transaction\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Independent\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such\npersons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Independent common stock or relative to the exchange ratio\u037e\n \n76\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n the effect of the transaction or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of\nsecurities of Independent, Meridian or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the actual value of Independent common stock to be issued in the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent common stock or Meridian common stock would trade following the public\nannouncement of the transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent common stock would trade following the\nconsummation of the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the transaction or any other transaction contemplated by the\nmerger agreement\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Independent, Meridian, any of their respective shareholders or\nstockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the transaction or any related transaction (including the bank merger),\nincluding whether or not the transaction would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.\nIn performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial\nconditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, Independent and Meridian. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by\nKBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these\nanalyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses\nor securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW\nopinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the Independent board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and\nthe merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Independent board with respect to\nthe fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between\nIndependent and Meridian and the decision of Independent to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Independent board.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Independent board in connection with its opinion. The summary\nis not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made by KBW to the Independent board, but\nsummarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include\ninformation presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness\nopinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of\nthose methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In\narriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as\nto the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be\nconsidered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying\nthe analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.\nFor purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $21.88 per outstanding\nshare of Meridian common stock, or $1,146.6 million in the aggregate (inclusive of the indicative value of in-the-money Meridian stock options), based on\nthe 0.275x exchange ratio in the proposed merger and the closing price of Independent common stock on April 21, 2021. In addition to the financial\nanalyses described below, KBW reviewed with the Independent board of directors for informational purposes, among other things, an implied transaction\nmultiple for the proposed merger (based on the implied transaction value for the merger of $21.88 per outstanding share of Meridian common stock) of\n15.2x\n \n77\nTable of Contents\nMeridian\u2019s estimated calendar year 2021 earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) using the publicly available calendar year 2021 EPS consensus \u201cstreet estimate\u201d of\nMeridian.\nIndependent Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and\nmarket performance of Independent to 13 selected major exchange-traded banks that are headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic region (defined as Delaware,\nthe District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) and the Northeast region (defined as Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) with total assets between $8 billion and $16 billion. Merger targets and Puerto Rico banks were excluded from\nthe selected companies.\nThe selected companies were as follows:\n \nEastern Bankshares, Inc.\n  \nEagle Bancorp, Inc.\nCommunity Bank System, Inc.\n  \nNBT Bancorp, Inc.\nNorthwest Bancshares, Inc.\n  \nTriState Capital Holdings, Inc.\nProvident Financial Services, Inc.\n  \nFirst Commonwealth Financial Corporation\nBerkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.\n  \nS&T Bancorp, Inc.\nSandy Spring Bancorp, Inc\n  \nBrookline Bancorp, Inc.\nOceanFirst Financial Corp.\n  \nTo perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for the most recent completed fiscal quarter (\u201cMRQ\u201d) publicly reported\nor as of the end of such period and market price information as of April 21, 2021. In the case of Independent, KBW also used profitability and other\nfinancial information provided by Independent for the quarter ended or as of March 31, 2021. In addition, KBW used 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates taken\nfrom publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d for Independent and the selected companies. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as\nreferenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Independent\u2019s historical financial statements, or the data prepared\nby Raymond James & Associates, Inc. presented under the section \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor,\u201d as a result of the different\nperiods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.\nKBW\u2019s analysis showed the following concerning the financial performance of Independent and the selected companies:\n \n \n  \nIndependent\n \n \nSelected Companies\n \n \n  \nFor\nQ1 2021 \n \nFor\nQ4 2020 \n \n25th\nPercentile \n \nMedian \n \nAverage \n \n75th\nPercentile \nMRQ Core Return on Average Assets(1)\n   \n1.28%   \n1.15%   \n0.72%   \n1.21%   \n1.12%   \n1.39% \nMRQ Core Return on Average Tangible Common Equity(1)\n   \n14.51%   \n12.97%   \n10.53%   14.00%   \n13.03%   \n14.74% \nMRQ Net Interest Margin\n   \n3.19%   \n3.10%   \n2.97%   \n3.05%   \n2.98%   \n3.26% \nMRQ Fee Income / Revenue Ratio(2)\n   \n20.7%   \n22.5%   \n17.3%   \n23.7%   \n22.8%   \n28.3% \nMRQ Efficiency Ratio\n   \n56.6%   \n58.0%   \n68.0%   \n58.5%   \n58.6%   \n54.8% \n \n(1)\nCore income excluded extraordinary items, non-recurring items, gains/losses on sale of securities and amortization of intangibles as calculated by\nS&P Global Market Intelligence.\n(2)\nExcluded gains/losses on sale of securities and assets and income from bank owned life insurance.\n \n78\nTable of Contents\nKBW\u2019s analysis also showed the following concerning the financial condition of Independent and the selected companies:\n \n \n  \nIndependent\n \n \nSelected Companies\n \n \n  \nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2021\n \n \nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2020\n \n \n25th\nPercentile \n \nMedian \n \nAverage \n \n75th\nPercentile \nTangible Common Equity / Tangible Assets\n  \n \n8.96%  \n \n9.26%  \n \n8.48%  \n \n8.86%  \n \n9.48%  \n \n9.27% \nTotal Capital Ratio\n  \n \n15.65%  \n \n15.13%  \n \n13.93%  \n 15.60%  \n \n16.33%  \n \n16.64% \nLoans / Deposits\n  \n \n79.8%  \n \n85.4%  \n \n82.4%  \n \n90.7%  \n \n89.2%  \n \n97.4% \nLoan Loss Reserve / Loans\n  \n \n1.16%  \n \n1.20%  \n \n1.03%  \n \n1.40%  \n \n1.25%  \n \n1.57% \nNonperforming Assets / Loans + OREO(1)\n  \n \n0.64%  \n \n0.89%  \n \n1.11%  \n \n0.91%  \n \n0.99%  \n \n0.81% \nMRQ Net Charge-offs / Average Loans\n  \n \n0.15%  \n \n0.09%  \n \n0.28%  \n \n0.15%  \n \n0.23%  \n \n0.10% \n \n(1)\nNPAs included nonaccrual loans, accruing troubled debt restructured loans, loans 90+ days past due, and other real estate owned as defined by\nS&P Global Market intelligence\nIn addition, KBW\u2019s analysis showed the following concerning the market performance of Independent and the selected companies:\n \n \n  \nIndependent(1) \n \nSelected Companies\n \n \n \n25th\nPercentile \n \nMedian \n \nAverage \n \n75th\nPercentile \nOne-Year Stock Price Change\n  \n \n19.8%  \n \n43.4%  \n \n57.4%  \n \n56.3%  \n \n75.0% \nYear-To-Date Stock Price Change\n  \n \n8.9%  \n \n23.5%  \n \n27.5%  \n \n26.1%  \n \n28.9% \nPrice / Tangible Book Value per Share\n  \n \n2.21x  \n \n1.47x  \n \n1.56x  \n \n1.68x  \n \n1.80x \nPrice / 2021 EPS Estimate\n  \n \n19.7x  \n \n13.5x  \n \n14.2x  \n \n16.4x  \n \n17.1x \nPrice / 2022 EPS Estimate\n  \n \n19.6x  \n \n12.5x  \n \n13.6x  \n \n14.7x  \n \n13.9x \nDividend Yield\n  \n \n2.4x  \n \n2.2x  \n \n3.0x  \n \n2.7x  \n \n3.1x \n2021 Dividend Payout Ratio\n  \n \n47.6%  \n \n39.3%  \n \n43.8%  \n \n42.3%  \n \n51.5% \n \n(1)\nUnless otherwise indicated, based on Independent data for the period ended or as of March 31, 2021.\nNo company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to Independent.

Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and market\nperformance of Independent to 11 selected major exchange-traded banks that are headquartered in the Northeast region with total assets between\n$2 billion and $10 billion.

KBW reviewed publicly available information related to eight selected U.S. whole bank transactions announced since\nJanuary 1, 2019 with announced transaction values between $500 million and $2 billion.\nThe selected transactions were as follows:\n \nAcquiror\n  \nAcquired Company\nEastern Bankshares, Inc.\n  Century Bancorp, Inc.\nWSFS Financial Corporation\n  Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation\nSVB Financial Group\n  Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc.\nPacific Premier Bancorp, Inc.\n  Opus Bank\nFB Financial Corporation\n  Franklin Financial Network, Inc.\nUnited Bankshares, Inc.\n  Carolina Financial Corporation\nPeople\u2019s United Financial, Inc.\n  United Financial Bancorp, Inc.\nValley National Bancorp\n  Oritani Financial Corp.\nFor each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction consideration value paid\nfor the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company\u2019s then latest publicly available financial statements prior to the\nannouncement of the respective transaction and, to the extent then publicly available, EPS consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d for the acquired company prior\nto the announcement of the respective transaction:\n \n \n\u2022\n Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Price per common share to the estimated EPS of the acquired company in the first full calendar year following the announcement of the\ntransaction (\u201cforward EPS\u201d) in the case of the seven selected transactions in which consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d for the acquired company\nwere then available\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000) of the acquired company, referred to as\ncore deposit premium.\nKBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company in the selected transactions as a premium to the closing price of the\nacquired company one day prior to the announcement of the acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the one-day market premium). The\nresulting transaction statistics for the selected transactions were compared with the corresponding transaction statistics for the proposed merger based\non the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $21.88 per outstanding share of Meridian common stock and using historical financial\ninformation for Independent as of or for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2021, the publicly available EPS consensus \u201cstreet estimate\u201d of Meridian\nfor 2022 and the closing price of Meridian common stock on April 21, 2021.\nThe results of the analysis are set forth in the following table (excluding the impact of the LTM EPS multiple for one of the selected transactions, which\nmultiple was considered to be not meaningful because it was greater than 30.0x):\n \n \n  \nIndependent\n/Meridian  \n \n25th\nPercentile \n \nMedian \n \nAverage \n \n75th\nPercentile \nPrice / Tangible Book Value per Share\n  \n \n1.50x  \n \n1.35x  \n \n1.45x  \n \n1.60x  \n \n1.83x \nPrice / LTM EPS\n  \n \n15.0x  \n \n14.5x  \n \n16.3x  \n \n18.0x  \n \n19.0x \nPrice / Forward EPS\n  \n \n14.9x  \n \n14.9x  \n \n15.3x  \n \n15.5x  \n \n16.2x \nCore Deposit Premium\n  \n \n8.6%  \n \n4.9%  \n \n6.2%  \n \n9.4%  \n \n10.7% \nOne-Day Market Premium\n  \n \n22.1%  \n \n3.5%  \n \n14.3%  \n \n12.5%  \n \n17.0% \n \n81\nTable of Contents\nNo company or transaction used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to Meridian or the proposed merger. Accordingly,\nan analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperating characteristics of the companies involved.\nRelative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Independent and Meridian to various pro forma balance sheet\nand income statement items and the combined market capitalization of the combined entity. This analysis did not include purchase accounting\nadjustments or synergies. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet data for Independent and Meridian as of March 31, 2021, (ii) publicly\navailable consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian, and (iii) market price information as of April 21, 2021. The results of KBW\u2019s analysis\nare set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of KBW\u2019s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of Independent\nand Meridian shareholders in the combined company based on the 0.275x exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement:\n \n \n  \nIndependent\n% of Total  \n \nMeridian\n% of Total \nOwnership at 0.275x merger exchange ratio:\n  \n \n69.9%  \n \n30.1% \nMarket Information\n  \n \nPre-Transaction Market Capitalization\n  \n \n74.5%  \n \n25.5% \nBalance Sheet:\n  \n \nAssets\n  \n \n67.9%  \n \n32.1% \nGross Loans Held for Investment\n  \n \n63.6%  \n \n36.4% \nDeposits\n  \n \n69.5%  \n \n30.5% \nTangible Common Equity\n  \n \n60.8%  \n \n39.2% \nIncome Statement:\n  \n \n2021 Earnings\n  \n \n65.1%  \n \n34.9% \n2022 Earnings\n  \n \n65.4%  \n \n34.6% \nForecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected income statement and\nbalance sheet information of Independent and Meridian. Using (i) closing balance sheet estimates as of December 31, 2021 for Independent and Meridian\ntaken from publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates,\u201d (ii) publicly available EPS consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian,\n(iii) assumed Independent long-term growth rates and financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for 2023 provided by Independent\nmanagement, and (iv) pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from the merger and\ncertain purchase accounting and other merger-related adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto) provided by Independent\nmanagement, KBW analyzed the potential financial impact of the transaction on certain projected financial results of Independent. This analysis indicated\nthe transaction could be accretive to Independent\u2019s estimated 2022 EPS and estimated 2023 EPS and could be accretive to Independent\u2019s estimated\ntangible book value per share at closing as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the transaction, each of\nIndependent\u2019s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, and Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at closing as of December 31, 2021\ncould be higher, and each of Independent\u2019s Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Risk Based Capital Ratio at closing as of December 31, 2021 could be lower. For\nall of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Independent following the transaction may vary from the projected results, and the variations\nmay be material.\nIndependent Dividend Discount Model Analysis. KBW performed a dividend discount model analysis of Independent to estimate ranges for the implied\nequity value of Independent. In this analysis, KBW used publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d for Independent and assumed long-term growth\nrates for Independent provided by Independent, and KBW assumed discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%. The ranges of values were derived by\nadding (i) the present value of implied future excess capital available for dividends that Independent could generate over the period from March 31, 2021\nto December 31, 2026 as a standalone company, and (ii) the present value of Independent\u2019s implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW\n \n82\nTable of Contents\nassumed that Independent would maintain a tangible common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level.\nKBW derived implied terminal values using two methodologies, one based on estimated 2027 earnings multiples and the other based on estimated\nDecember 31, 2026 tangible book value multiples. In calculating the terminal value of Independent, KBW applied a range of 16.0x to 20.0x Independent\u2019s\nestimated 2027 earnings and a range of 1.90x to 2.30x Independent\u2019s estimated December 31, 2026 tangible book value. This dividend discount model\nanalysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of Independent common stock of $67.07 per share to $84.35 per share based on estimated 2027\nearnings multiples and a range of implied values per share of Independent common stock of $76.15 per share to $94.40 per share based on estimated\nDecember 31, 2026 tangible book value multiples.\nThe dividend discount model analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent on the\nassumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. The foregoing dividend discount model\nanalysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Independent or the pro forma combined company.\nMeridian Dividend Discount Model Analysis. KBW performed a dividend discount model analysis of Meridian to estimate a range for the implied equity\nvalue of Meridian, taking into account pro forma assumptions (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result from\nthe merger and certain purchase accounting and other merger-related adjustments and restructuring charges assumed with respect thereto). In this\nanalysis, KBW used publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Meridian, financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for\nperiods beyond 2022 provided by Independent management, and pro forma assumptions provided by Independent management, and KBW assumed\ndiscount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%. The range of values was derived by adding (i) the present value of implied future excess capital available for\ndividends that Meridian could generate over the period from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2026 and (ii) the present value of Meridian\u2019s implied terminal\nvalue at the end of such period, in each case applying estimated cost savings and related expenses and other pro forma assumptions. KBW assumed that\nMeridian would maintain a tangible common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In calculating the\nterminal value of Meridian, KBW applied a range of 12.0x to 14.0x Meridian\u2019s estimated 2027 earnings (after applying estimated cost savings and related\nexpenses and other pro forma assumptions). This dividend discount model analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of Meridian common\nstock (taking into account pro forma assumptions) of $24.43 per share to $28.52 per share.\nThe dividend discount model analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent on the\nassumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. The foregoing dividend discount model\nanalysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Meridian.\nMiscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to Independent in connection with the proposed merger and did not act as an advisor to or agent of any\nother person. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in\nconnection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for\nvarious other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of banking\nenterprises. Further to certain existing sales and trading relationships between Independent and each of KBW and a KBW broker-dealer affiliate, and\notherwise in the ordinary course of KBW and its affiliates\u2019 broker-dealer businesses, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time purchase securities\nfrom, and sell securities to, Independent and Meridian. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a\nlong or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Independent or Meridian for its and their own respective accounts and for the\naccounts of its and their respective customers and clients.\nPursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Independent has agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee of $4,750,000, $750,000 of which became payable to\nKBW with the rendering of KBW\u2019s opinion and the balance of which is contingent upon the consummation of the transaction. Independent also has\nagreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its engagement and\n \n83\nTable of Contents\nto indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW\u2019s engagement or KBW\u2019s role in connection therewith. Other than the\npresent engagement, in the past two years preceding the date of the opinion, KBW did not provide investment banking or financial advisory services to\nIndependent. In the two years preceding the date of KBW\u2019s opinion, KBW did not provide investment banking or financial advisory services to\nMeridian. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Independent or Meridian and receive compensation for\nsuch services.",

        "Section Text": "Interests of Meridian\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Meridian, Meridian\u2019s stockholders should be aware that Meridian\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Meridian stockholders generally. The\nboard of directors of Meridian was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, when it approved the merger agreement. These\ninterests, to the extent material, are described below.\nOwnership of Meridian\nThe directors and executive officers of Meridian currently own Meridian common stock, some of whom have also been granted Meridian stock options\nand restricted stock. As of June 1, 2021, such directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 2,795,425 shares of Meridian common\nstock, which total includes shares of Meridian common stock underlying Meridian stock options exercisable within 60 days of such date and restricted\nshares of Meridian common stock that have vested or vest within 60 days of such date.\nTreatment of Meridian Equity Awards\nThe executive officers and directors of Meridian and East Boston participate in Meridian\u2019s equity-based compensation plans and hold outstanding stock\noptions and restricted stock granted under the plans.    \nThe merger agreement provides that Meridian equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be treated as follows:\nStock Options. Each stock option, whether vested or unvested, will fully vest and be cancelled at the effective time of the merger. On the closing date of\nthe merger, East Boston or Meridian will pay to the holders of such stock options cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of\nMeridian common stock provided for in each such stock option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the per share cash equivalent consideration (as\ndefined below) over (y) the exercise price. Any stock option for which the exercise price per share of Meridian common stock provided for in such stock\noption exceeds the per share cash equivalent consideration will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger without payment. The cash payment will\nbe paid within five business days after the closing date of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of the merger\nagreement, \u201cper share cash equivalent consideration\u201d means the product (rounded to the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the exchange ratio by\n(ii) the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of the Independent common stock on Nasdaq for the consecutive period of five full trading days\nending on the day immediately preceding the closing date.\nRestricted Stock Awards. Each share of restricted stock will fully vest at the effective time of the merger and be considered an outstanding share of\nMeridian common stock entitled to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be issued within five business days after the closing\ndate of the merger, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.\n \n88Table of Contents\nStock Options.

Gavegnano. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to\nhonor in accordance with its terms all benefits payable under Mr. Gavegnano\u2019s employment agreement. Under the employment agreement, if\nMr. Gavegnano\u2019s employment is terminated by East Boston without \u201ccause\u201d or he resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d, within one year following the closing of the\nmerger, then, in addition to receiving his accrued but unpaid compensation, he will receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to 2.99 times his\n\u201cbase amount\u201d (as defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code). Mr. Gavegnano\u2019s employment agreement provides for a reduction in payments or\nbenefits to the extent necessary to avoid such payments or benefits being subject to Section 280G of the Code. For an estimate of the amount that would\nbe payable to Mr. Gavegnano under the employment agreement, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d below.\nEast Boston previously entered into substantially similar change in control agreements with John A. Carroll, Kenneth R. Fisher, Edward J. Merritt, John\nMigliozzi and Frank P. Romano. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits payable\nunder these change in control agreements. The change in control agreements provide that if an executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated by East\nBoston without \u201ccause\u201d or the executive officer resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d, within two years following the closing of the merger, then, in addition to\nreceiving his accrued but unpaid compensation, the executive officer will receive (i) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to two times the sum of\nthe executive officer\u2019s (x) annual base salary and (y) highest level of incentive cash compensation paid over the prior three most recent calendar years\nended before or simultaneously with the change in control and (ii) the executive officer\u2019s continued medical and life insurance coverage for 24 months\nfollowing the date of termination, or if such participation under the East Boston\u2019s benefit plans is not permitted or would result in East Boston incurring\npenalties, a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to such benefits, payable within 10 business days following the executive officer\u2019s termination.\nThe existing change in control agreements with Messrs. Carroll, Fisher, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano provide for a reduction in payments or benefits to\nthe extent necessary to avoid such payments or benefits being subject to Section 280G of the Code. It is estimated that Mr. Carroll will be paid $837,800\nunder his change in control agreement. For an estimate of the amount that would be payable to Messrs. Fisher, Merritt, Migliozzi and Romano under the\nchange in control agreements, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments to Meridian\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d\nbelow.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Agreements with Richard J. Gavegnano and Edward J. Merritt\nEast Boston previously entered into a supplemental executive retirement agreement with Richard J. Gavegnano, which agreement was amended and\nrestated, effective July 28, 2014 (which is referred to in this document as the SERP). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Independent has agreed to honor\nin accordance with its terms all benefits payable under the SERP. Under the SERP, if Mr. Gavegnano terminates employment for any reason other than for\ncause, he will receive an annual benefit (paid monthly) equal to 70% of his final average compensation. For purposes of the SERP, final average\ncompensation equals the three years\u2019 base salary that results in the highest average. The annual benefit is generally payable in the form of an unreduced\nlife annuity with a 50% spousal survivor annuity, or the actuarial equivalent of this benefit as a single lump sum distribution. Mr. Gavegnano elected to\nreceive a lump sum payment in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Mr. Gavegnano, who is fully vested in the SERP, will receive an estimated lump\nsum cash payment of $7,215,167 as of the closing date of the merger.\n \n90\nTable of Contents\nEast Boston previously entered into a supplemental executive retirement agreement with Edward J.

Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\u201d beginning on page 111 of this Form S-4.\n \n94\nTable of Contents\nQuantification of Potential Payments to Meridian\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K regarding compensation for each named executive officer of\nMeridian that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable\nSEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Meridian\u2019s named executive officers.\nThe \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of holders of Meridian common stock, as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 2 - Meridian Compensation Proposal.\u201d The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden\nparachute disclosure, the amount of payments and benefits (on a pre-tax basis) that each of Meridian\u2019s named executive officers would receive, using the\nfollowing assumptions:\n \n \n\u2022\n the effective time of the merger will occur on June 1, 2021 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute\ncompensation disclosure and which is the last practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n a termination of each named executive officer\u2019s employment without cause, as of immediately following the effective time of the merger and\nthe payment of Mr. Migliozzi\u2019s cash severance pursuant to the terms of the offer letter (as described above)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate remaining unchanged from those in place as of June 1, 2021\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n for purposes of calculating the value of non-vested equity awards that will become vested as of the effective time of the merger, equity\nawards are those that are outstanding as of June 1, 2021\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n a price per share of Meridian common stock of $22.40 (the average closing market price of Meridian common stock over the first five\nbusiness days following the public announcement of the merger on April 22, 2021).\nThe calculations in the tables set forth below do not include amounts that Meridian\u2019s named executive officers were already entitled to receive or that\nwere vested as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The calculations in the table also do not include certain compensation that may\nbecome payable after the closing date of the merger, such as consulting fees, since such payments are contingent upon services to be provided to\nIndependent following the closing date of the merger. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity award grants,\nissuances or forfeitures that may occur prior to the completion of the merger except for the proposed grant of restricted stock awards in 2021 (as\ndescribed above). As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the\nassumptions described in the footnotes to the tables below, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ\nfrom the amounts set forth below.\n \nName\n  \nCash\n($)(1)\n   \nEquity\n($)(2)\n   \nPerquisites/\nBenefits\n($)(3)\n   \nOther\n($)(4)\n   \nTotal\n($)\n \nRichard J.

Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve pursuant to section 3\nof the Bank Holding Company Act. In considering the approval of a transaction such as the conversion to a bank holding company and the merger, the\nBank Holding Company Act, requires the Federal Reserve to review: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial condition and future\nprospects, including capital positions and managerial resources, (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the record of the\ninsured depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding companies under the Community Reinvestment Act (the \u201cCRA\u201d), (4) the effectiveness of\nthe companies and the depository institutions concerned in combating money-laundering activities, and (5) the extent to which the proposal would result\nin greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the Federal Reserve provides\nan opportunity for public comment on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if they determine that such meeting\nor other proceeding would be appropriate.\nUnder the CRA, the Federal Reserve must take into account the record of performance of the companies and the depository institutions concerned in\nmeeting the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, served by such companies and depository\ninstitutions. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA by their primary federal supervisor and are assigned ratings.\nIn evaluating the record of performance of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served by the institution, the Federal\nReserve considers the institution\u2019s record of compliance with the CRA, including the most recent rating assigned by its primary federal supervisor. As of\ntheir last respective CRA examinations, Rockland Trust was rated \u201cOutstanding\u201d and East Boston was rated \u201cSatsifactory\u201d with respect to CRA\ncompliance.\nThe federal Bank Merger Act also mandates that the prior approval of the FDIC, the primary federal regulator of the resulting bank, is required to merge\nEast Boston Bank with and into Rockland Bank. In evaluating an application filed under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC generally considers: (1) the\ncompetitive impact of the transaction, (2) financial and managerial resources of the banks party to the bank merger or mergers, (3) the convenience and\nneeds of the community to be served and the record of the banks under the CRA, including their CRA ratings, (4) the banks\u2019 effectiveness in combating\nmoney-laundering activities and (5) the extent to which the bank merger or mergers would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of\nthe U.S. banking or financial system.

Certain of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to approval by the Massachusetts\nDivision of Banks pursuant to Chapter 167I of the Massachusetts General Laws. In evaluating a merger application under these sections, the\nMassachusetts Division of Banks will review a proposed merger to determine whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably\naffected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted. In making such determination, the commissioner shall consider, at a minimum,\na showing of net new benefits. Net new benefits may include for example, initial capital investments, job creation plans, consumer and business services,\nand commitments to maintain and open branch offices within the continuing institution\u2019s assessment area.\nThe parties have filed or will file certain applications and notice materials necessary to obtain these regulatory approvals or confirmations in accordance\nwith applicable law. The merger cannot be completed until all the required approvals and confirmations have been obtained, are in full force and effect and\nall statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired, and the bank merger cannot be completed until after both approvals listed above have been\nobtained. The merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or such shorter period as the Federal\nReserve Board may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days), during which time the\nDepartment of Justice may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds. The bank merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the approval of the\nFDIC (or such shorter period as the FDIC may prescribe with the concurrence of the United States Department of Justice, but not less than 15 days),\nduring which time the Department of Justice may challenge the bank merger on antitrust grounds. The commencement of an antitrust action by the\nDepartment of Justice would stay the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve Board or FDIC approval, as the case may be, unless a court specifically orders\notherwise. In reviewing the merger and the bank merger, the Department of Justice could analyze the merger\u2019s effect on competition differently than the\nFederal Reserve Board and the FDIC, and it is possible that the Department of Justice could reach a different conclusion than the applicable banking\nregulator regarding the merger\u2019s (or the bank merger\u2019s) competitive effects.\nIndependent and Meridian cannot assure you that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained or\nwhether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals. Independent and Meridian also cannot assure\nyou that the United States Department of Justice or the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not attempt to challenge the\nmerger on antitrust grounds, or what the outcome will be if such a challenge is made. Independent and Meridian are not aware of any other government\napprovals or actions that are required prior to the parties\u2019 consummation of the merger. It is currently contemplated that if any additional governmental\napprovals or actions are required, such approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any of the additional approvals or\nactions will be obtained.",

In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations\nand warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not\nto consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and\nallocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties also may be\nsubject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC, and\nsome were qualified by the matters contained in the confidential disclosure schedules that Independent and Meridian each delivered in connection with\nthe merger agreement and certain documents filed with the SEC.

        "Section Text": "COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS OF INDEPENDENT AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MERIDIAN\nThis section describes the differences between the rights of holders of Meridian common stock and the rights of holders of Independent common stock.\nWhile we believe that the description covers the material differences between the rights of the holders, this summary may not contain all of the\ninformation that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and refer to the other documents discussed below for a more\ncomplete understanding of the differences between your rights as a holder of Meridian common stock and your rights as a holder of Independent\ncommon stock.\nAs a stockholder of Meridian, a Maryland corporation, your rights are governed by Maryland law, Meridian\u2019s articles of incorporation, as currently in\neffect, and Meridian\u2019s bylaws, as currently in effect. When the merger becomes effective and you receive Independent common stock in exchange for\nyour Meridian shares, you will become a shareholder of Independent, a Massachusetts corporation. Independent\u2019s common stock is listed on NASDAQ\nunder the symbol \u201cINDB.\u201d As an Independent shareholder, your rights will be governed by Massachusetts law, Independent\u2019s articles of organization, as\nin effect from time to time, and Independent\u2019s bylaws, as in effect from time to time.\nThe following discussion of the rights of Meridian stockholders under Maryland law and Independent shareholders under Massachusetts law, and the\nsimilarities and material differences between (i) the rights of Meridian stockholders under the articles of organization and bylaws of Meridian and (ii) the\nrights of Independent shareholders under the articles of organization and bylaws of Independent. This discussion is only a summary of some provisions\nand is not a complete description of these similarities and differences. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to Maryland and\nMassachusetts law and the full texts of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Meridian and of the articles of organization and bylaws of\nIndependent.\n \n \n  \nMeridian\n  \nIndependent\nCapitalization\n  \nThe total authorized capital stock of Meridian consists of\n100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,\nand 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share.\nAs of the record date, there were 52,584,413 shares of common\nstock outstanding held by approximately 1,708 holders of\nrecord, including shares held in the East Boston ESOP, and no\nshares of preferred stock outstanding.\n  \nThe total authorized capital stock of Independent consists of\n75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share\nand 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per\nshare. As of the record date, there were 33,038,752 shares of\ncommon stock outstanding held by approximately 2,892\nholders of record, and no shares of preferred stock\noutstanding.\nPreemptive Rights\n  \nA preemptive right allows a shareholder to maintain its proportionate share of ownership of a corporation by permitting the\nshareholder to purchase a proportionate share of any new stock issuances. Preemptive rights protect the shareholders from\ndilution of value and control upon new stock issuances. For a Maryland corporation incorporated on or after October 1,\n1995, unless the articles of incorporation expressly grants such rights to the stockholder, a stockholder does not have any\npreemptive rights. Under Massachusetts law, unless the articles of organization say otherwise, shareholders have no\npreemptive rights.\n  \nMeridian\u2019s articles of incorporation state that stockholders will\nnot have preemptive rights except for those approved by the\nboard of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a\nmajority of the directors then in office. Currently, Meridian\u2019s\nstockholders do not have preemptive rights.\n  \nIndependent does not have a provision authorizing\npreemptive rights\u037e in fact, Independent\u2019s articles of\norganization contain provisions specifically denying them.\nAccordingly, Independent\u2019s shareholders do not have\npreemptive rights.\n \n127Table of Contents\n \n  \nMeridian\n  \nIndependent\nLimitations on Voting\nRights\n  \nMeridian\u2019s articles of incorporation provide that no record\nholders of any outstanding common stock of Meridian that is\nbeneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a person who\nbeneficially owns more than 10% of the then-outstanding\nshares of common stock of Meridian will be permitted to vote\nany shares held in excess of the 10% limit unless, before the\nperson acquired beneficial ownership of such shares in excess\nof the 10% limit, such acquisition of shares was approved by a\nmajority of Meridian\u2019s unaffiliated directors. This limitation does\nnot apply to directors or officers acting solely in their capacities\nas directors and officers, or to any employee stock ownership or\nsimilar plan of Meridian or any of its subsidiaries or to trustees\nof such plans solely by reason of their capacity as trustees. In\naddition, Meridian\u2019s board of directors has the power to\nconstrue and apply the provisions in the articles of\nincorporation regarding the 10% limitation on voting rights and\nto make all determinations necessary or desirable to implement\nthese provisions.\n  \nNeither of Independent\u2019s articles of organization or bylaws\ncontain limitations on the voting rights of the equity securities\nof Independent, nor are such limitations applicable to\nIndependent\u2019s equity securities under Massachusetts\ncorporate law.\nDividends and Other\nStock Rights\n  \nHolders of Meridian common stock are entitled to receive such\ndividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds\nlegally available for such payment, subject to the rights of\nholders of preferred stock. The Meridian board of directors is\nalso authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to:\n(i) provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock in\nseries, (ii) establish from time to time the number of shares to be\nincluded in each such series, and (iii) fix the preferences,\nconversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions,\nlimitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and\nconditions of redemption of the shares of each such series.\n  \nIndependent can also pay dividends on its common stock in\naccordance with Massachusetts law. Independent\u2019s board of\ndirectors is also authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred\nstock to (i) designate preferred stock, (ii) set dividend rates or\nthe amount of dividends to be paid on the preferred stock,\n(iii) determine voting powers of the preferred stock,\n(iv) determine whether the preferred stock is redeemable by\nIndependent, (v) determine the amount or amounts payable\nupon the preferred stock in the event of a voluntary or\ninvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of\nIndependent, (vi) determine whether the preferred stock is\nentitled to the benefits of a sinking or retirement fund to be\napplied to the preferred stock, (vii) determine whether the\npreferred stock is convertible or exchangeable for shares of\nanother class of Independent stock, (viii) determine the\npurchase price of the preferred stock, and (ix) make other\ndeterminations with respect to preferred stock.\n \n128\nTable of Contents\n \n  \nMeridian\n  \nIndependent\n  \n  \n \nWhen and if a quarterly cash dividend is declared by the\nboard of directors, if any Independent shares of preferred\nstock are outstanding, the holders of shares of preferred stock\nwill be entitled to receive dividends in an amount per share\ndescribed in Independent\u2019s articles of organization, subject to\nthe rights of the holders of any shares of any series of\npreferred stock ranking prior and superior to Independent\npreferred stock with respect to dividends.\nRight to Call Special\nMeetings of\nStockholders of\nMeridian and of\nShareholders of\nIndependent\n  \nSpecial meetings may be called:\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the president\u037e\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the chairperson of the board of directors\u037e\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted\nby the majority of the total number of directors that\nMeridian would have if there were no vacancies on the\nboard of directors\u037e or\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the secretary at the written request of stockholders\nentitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to\nbe cast at the meeting.\n  \nSpecial meetings may be called:\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the chairman of the board, if any\u037e\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the president\u037e\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby a majority of the directors\u037e or\n \n\u2022\u2003\u200aby the secretary, or in case of the death, absence,\nincapacity or refusal of the secretary, by any other officer,\nat the written direction of the holders of at least two-\nthirds of the capital stock of the Independent entitled to\nvote at the meeting.\n \nFor shareholders to call a special meeting, Independent\nrequires the written application of the holders of at least two-\nthirds of the capital stock, as opposed to the written request of\nstockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes\nentitled to be cast at the meeting that is required for Meridian\nstockholders to call a special meeting. Therefore, it may be\nmore difficult for Independent\u2019s shareholders to call a special\nmeeting.\nNotice of Stockholder\nMeetings\n  \nMeridian requires that notice of stockholder meetings be given\nnot less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the meeting.\n  \nIndependent requires that notice of shareholder meetings be\ngiven not less than 7 days nor more than 60 days before the\nmeeting.\nBoard of Directors\u2013\nNumber and Term of\nOffice\n  \nMeridian\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that the\nnumber of directors of Meridian shall, by virtue of Meridian\u2019s\nelection made to be governed by Section 3-804(b) of the\nMaryland General Corporation Law (which is referred to in this\ndocument as the MGCL), be fixed from time to time exclusively\nby vote of the board of directors\u037e provided, however, that such\nnumber shall never be less than the minimum\n  \nIndependent\u2019s bylaws and articles of organization provide that\nthe number of directors shall be between three and 25 as fixed\nfrom time to time by vote of the board of directors at any\nregular or special meeting thereof. The board of directors may\nincrease or decrease the number of directors in one or more\nclasses to ensure that the three classes shall be as nearly\nequal as possible. \u201cPreference Stock Directors\u201d are those who\n \n129\nTable of Contents\n \n  \nMeridian\n  \nIndependent\n  \nnumber of directors required by the MGCL. Currently,\nMeridian\u2019s board of directors is set at 11 directors.\n \nMeridian\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide further\nthat the directors, other than those who may be elected by the\nholders of preferred stock, shall be divided into three classes, as\nnearly equally as possible, creating a staggered board of\ndirectors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors\nelected to succeed those directors whose terms expire will be\nelected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding\nannual meeting of stockholders after their election or for such\nshorter period of time as the board of directors may determine,\nwith each director to hold office until his or her term expires and\nuntil his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified.\nThe vote of a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting is required\nto elect directors of Meridian. Stockholders are not permitted to\ncumulate their votes in the election of directors.\n \nMeridian\u2019s bylaws also provide that any vacancy occurring in\nthe board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an\nincrease in the number of directors or the death, resignation or\nremoval of a director, may be filled only by the affirmative vote\nof two-thirds of the remaining directors then in office, even if\nsuch directors do not constitute a quorum. A director elected to\nfill a vacancy will be elected to serve for the remainder of the full\nterm of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and\nuntil the director\u2019s successor is elected and qualified.\n \nAmong the eligibility criteria set forth in Section 12 of\nMeridian\u2019s bylaws is the requirement that no person can be\nqualified to serve as a director of Meridian after December 31 in\nthe year such person reaches the age of 75.\n  \nmay be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock\nhaving a preference over the common stock as to dividends or\nupon liquidation. Directors other than Preference Stock\nDirectors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equally\nas possible, creating a staggered board of directors.\n \nIndependent\u2019s bylaws and governance principles provide for\nmajority voting in uncontested director elections. In an\nuncontested election, if an incumbent director standing for\nelection is not reelected by a majority of the votes cast, the\ndirector is required to promptly tender a notice of resignation\nto the board of directors. The resignation is not effective\nunless accepted by the board of directors. The nominating\ncommittee would then recommend whether the board of\ndirectors should accept or reject a tendered resignation. In\ndetermining whether to accept a tendered resignation, the\nboard of directors would consider the potential impact of the\nresignation on compliance with applicable legal and listing\nstandards and any other factors deemed relevant. An election\nis uncontested if the number of persons nominated does not\nexceed the number of director positions to be filled at the\nmeeting. In contested elections, the vote standard would be a\nplurality of votes cast.\n \nNo director shall continue to serve once he or she attains the\nage of 72. Except for Preference Stock Directors, newly created\ndirectorships and vacancies on the board of directors shall be\nfilled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining\ndirectors then in office, even though less than a quorum. Any\ndirector so elected shall hold office for the remainder of the full\nterm of the class of directors in which the new directorship\nwas created or the vacancy occurred.\nBoard of Director\nNominations\n  \nMeridian\u2019s articles of incorporation provide that advance notice\nof stockholder nomination for the election of directors and of\nbusiness to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of\nthe stockholders of\n  \nNominations for election to the board of directors at the\nannual meeting of shareholders may be made by or at the\ndirection of the board of directors, the nominating committee,\nor by any shareholder\n \n130\nTable of Contents\n \n  \nMeridian\n  \nIndependent\n  \nMeridian shall be given in the manner provided in the bylaws.\nThe bylaws, in turn, provide that nominations of persons for the\nelection to the board of directors may be made at a meeting of\nstockholders at which directors are to be elected only: (i) by or\nat the direction of the board of directors\u037e or (ii) by any\nstockholder of Meridian who (1) is a stockholder of record on\nthe date the stockholder gives notice as described below and on\nthe record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to\nvote at such meeting, and (2) complies with the notice\nprocedures as set forth below.\n \nNominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the\nboard of directors, must be made by timely notice in writing to\nthe secretary of Meridian.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has requested that Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (\u201cRaymond James\u201d) provide an\nopinion (the \u201cOpinion\u201d) to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of the Company Common\nStock (other than the Exception Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For purposes of\nthis Opinion, and with your consent, we have assumed that the there are approximately 52.4 million shares of Company Common Stock issued and\noutstanding and approximately 33.1 million shares of Independent common stock issued and outstanding.\nIn connection with our review of the proposed Merger and the preparation of this Opinion, we have, among other things:\n \n \n1.\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions as stated in the draft of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 21, 2021 (the\n\u201cAgreement\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n2.\nreviewed certain information related to the historical condition and prospects of the Company and Independent, as made available to\nRaymond James by or on behalf of the Company, including, but not limited to, (a) financial projections for each of the Company and\nIndependent that were prepared using consensus analyst estimates for the years 2021 and 2022 with further years extrapolated based on\nappropriate growth rates, which were reviewed and approved for our use by the management of the Company (the \u201cProjections\u201d) and\n(b) certain forecasts and estimates of potential cost savings, operating efficiencies, revenue effects, and other pro forma financial\nadjustments expected to result from the Merger, as approved and directed for our use by management of the Company (the \u201cPro Forma\nFinancial Adjustments\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n3.\nreviewed the Company\u2019s and Independent\u2019s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and\nunaudited financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2021\u037e\n \n880 Carillon Parkway // St. Petersburg, FL 33716\nT 727.567.1000 // raymondjames.com\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., member New York Stock Exchange/SIPC\n \nB-1Table of Contents\nBoard of Directors\nMeridian Bancorp, Inc.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 2\n \n \n4.\nreviewed the Company\u2019s and Independent\u2019s recent public filings and certain other publicly available information regarding the Company\nand Independent\u037e\n \n \n5.\nreviewed the financial and operating performance of the Company and Independent and those of other selected public companies that we\ndeem to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n6.\nconsidered certain publicly available financial terms of certain transactions we deem to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n7.\nreviewed the current and historical market prices for shares of the Company Common Stock and shares of Independent common stock, and\nthe current market prices of the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that we deemed to be relevant\u037e\n \n \n8.\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed\nappropriate\u037e\n \n \n9.\nreceived a certificate addressed to Raymond James from a member of senior management of the Company regarding, among other things,\nthe accuracy of the information, data and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or discussed with, Raymond James by or on\nbehalf of the Company\u037e and\n \n \n10.\ndiscussed with members of the senior management of the Company certain information relating to the aforementioned and any other matters\nwhich we have deemed relevant to our inquiry including, but not limited to, the past and current business operations of the Company and\nthe financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company.\nWith your consent, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with us, and we have undertaken no duty or responsibility to, nor did we, independently verify any of such\ninformation. Furthermore, we have undertaken no independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims\nor other contingent liabilities, to which the Company or Independent is a party or may be subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible\nunasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which the Company or Independent is a party or may be subject. With your consent, this Opinion\nmakes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the potential effects of any such litigation, claims or investigations or possible\nassertions. We have not made or obtained an independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or Independent.\nWith respect to the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments and any other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed\nwith us, we have, with your consent, assumed that the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments and such other information and data have been\nreasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting (or, in the case of the Projections with respect to 2021 and 2022, which were prepared using\nconsensus analyst estimates for the years 2021 and 2022, are consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the\nCompany, and we have relied upon the Company to advise us promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be\nupdated during the period of our review. We express no opinion with respect to the Projections, Pro Forma Financial Adjustments or the assumptions on\nwhich they are based. We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to the draft reviewed by us, and that the Merger\nwill be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver or amendment of any conditions thereto. Furthermore, we have\nassumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Agreement are true and correct\nand that each\n \nLOGO\n \nB-2\nTable of Contents\nBoard of Directors\nMeridian Bancorp, Inc.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 3\n \nsuch party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement without being waived. We have relied\nupon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable\ninternational, federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Merger will be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or\nwaivers made that would have an effect on the Merger, Independent or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion.\nOur opinion is based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing and disclosed to us as of April 21, 2021 and any\nmaterial change in such circumstances and conditions would require a reevaluation of this Opinion, which we are under no obligation to undertake. As\nyou are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or view as to any potential\neffects of such volatility on the Merger, the Company, or Independent and this Opinion does not purport to address potential developments in any such\nmarkets. As you are aware, there is significant uncertainty as to the potential direct and indirect business, financial, legal, economic and social\nimplications and consequences of the spread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses and the actions and measures that countries, governments,\nregulatory agencies, central banks, international financing and funding organizations, stock markets, businesses and individuals may take to address the\nspread of the coronavirus and associated illnesses including, without limitation, those actions and measures pertaining to fiscal or monetary policies,\nlegal and regulatory matters and the credit, financial and stock markets (collectively, the \u201cPandemic Effects\u201d). We express no opinion or view as to the\npotential impact of the Pandemic Effects on our analysis, this Opinion, the Merger, the Company or Independent. We have relied upon and assumed,\nwithout independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or\nprospects of the Company or Independent since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,\nprovided to us that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information\nreviewed by us incomplete or misleading in any material respect.\nWe express no opinion as to the underlying business decision to effect the Merger, the structure or tax consequences of the Merger or the availability or\nadvisability of any alternatives to the Merger. We provided advice to the Board with respect to the proposed Merger. We did not, however, recommend\nany specific amount of consideration or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. We did not solicit\nindications of interest with respect to a transaction involving the Company. This letter does not express any opinion as to the likely trading range of\nIndependent\u2019s stock following the Merger, which may vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities or on the financial\ncondition of Independent at that time. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to be received by the\nholders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Exception Shares).\nWe express no opinion with respect to any other reasons, legal, business, or otherwise, that may support the decision of the Board to approve or\nconsummate the Merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation is intended by Raymond James on matters that require legal, accounting or\ntax advice. It is assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations have been or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources.\nFurthermore, we have relied, with the consent of the Board, on the fact that the Company has been assisted by legal, accounting and tax advisors and we\nhave, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and assumed the\n \nLOGO\n \nB-3\nTable of Contents\nBoard of Directors\nMeridian Bancorp, Inc.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 4\n \naccuracy and completeness of the assessments by the Company and its advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters with respect to the Company\nand the Merger, including, without limitation, that the Company and Independent\u2019s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP\nand that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We are not\nexperts in the evaluation of allowances for loan and lease losses and have not independently verified such allowances or reviewed or examined any\nindividual loan or credit files. We have assumed, with your consent, that the allowance for loan and lease losses (i) set forth in the financial statements of\nthe Company and Independent are adequate to cover such losses, (ii) will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity and (iii) comply fully\nwith applicable law, regulatory policy and sound banking practices as of the date of such financial statements.\nIn formulating our opinion, we have considered only what we understand to be the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of Company Common\nStock (other than the Exception Shares) as is described above and we did not consider and we express no opinion on the fairness of the amount or nature\nof any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the Company\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, whether relative to the\ncompensation received by the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than the Exception Shares) or otherwise. We have not been requested to\nopine as to, and this Opinion does not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (1) the fairness of the Merger to the holders of\nany class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in the\nlast sentence of this Opinion or (2) the fairness of the Merger to any one class or group of the Company\u2019s or any other party\u2019s security holders or other\nconstituencies vis-\u00e0-vis any other class or group of the Company\u2019s or such other party\u2019s security holders or other constituents (including, without\nlimitation, the allocation of any consideration to be received in the Merger amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other\nconstituents). We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Independent or the\nability of the Company or Independent to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nThe delivery of this opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Raymond James.\nRaymond James has been engaged to render financial advisory services to the Company in connection with the proposed Merger and will receive a fee\nfor such services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Raymond James will also receive a fee upon the\ndelivery of this Opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger or on the conclusion reached herein. In addition, the\nCompany has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, Raymond James may trade in the securities of the Company and Independent for our own account or for the\naccounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In the two years preceding the date of this\nopinion letter, Raymond James has engaged in fixed income trading activity with Independent and/or certain of its affiliates, for which it has earned\nincome. Furthermore, Raymond James may provide investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to the Company and/or\nIndependent or other participants in the Merger in the future, for which Raymond James may receive compensation.\n \nLOGO\n \nB-4\nTable of Contents\nBoard of Directors\nMeridian Bancorp, Inc.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 5\n \nIt is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in each director\u2019s capacity as such) in evaluating\nthe proposed Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or any shareholder of the Company or Independent regarding\nhow said shareholder should act or vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter. Furthermore, this letter should not be construed as\ncreating any fiduciary duty on the part of Raymond James to any such party.

We may in the\nfuture provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Independent or Meridian and receive compensation for such services.\nIn connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition of\nIndependent and Meridian and bearing upon the Transaction, including among other things, the following: (i) an execution version of the Agreement,\ndated as of April 22, 2021\u037e (ii) the audited financial statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of\nIndependent\u037e (iii) certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Independent (provided by\nIndependent)\u037e (iv) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 of Meridian\u037e\n(v) certain preliminary and unaudited quarterly financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of Meridian (provided by Meridian)\u037e (vi) certain\nregulatory filings of Independent and Meridian and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FRY-9C and call reports filed\nwith respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2020\u037e (vii) certain other interim reports and other communications of\nIndependent and Meridian to their respective shareholders or stockholders\u037e and (viii) other financial information concerning the respective businesses\nand operations of Independent and Meridian furnished to us by Independent and Meridian or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of\nour analyses. Our consideration of financial information and other factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our\nanalyses included, among others, the following: (i) the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Independent and Meridian\u037e\n(ii) the assets and liabilities of Independent and Meridian\u037e (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the\nbanking industry\u037e (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock market information of Independent and Meridian with similar information for certain\nother companies, the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e (v) publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian, as well as\nassumed Independent long-term growth rates and financial and operating forecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022 provided to us\nby Independent management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and relied upon by us at the direction of\nsuch management and with the consent of the Board\u037e and (vi) estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transaction on Independent\n(including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the Transaction) that were\nprepared by, and provided to and discussed with us by, Independent management, and used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management\nand with the consent of the Board. We have also performed such other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account\nour assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities\nvaluation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We have also participated in discussions held by the managements of Independent and\nMeridian regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies\nand such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.\nIn conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and\nother information that was provided to us or that was publicly available\n \nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company\n \nC-2\nTable of Contents\nThe Board of Directors \u2013 Independent Bank Corp.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 3 of 5\n \nand we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such\nverification, accuracy or completeness. We have relied upon Independent management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly\navailable consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of Independent and Meridian, the assumed Independent long-term growth rates, the financial and operating\nforecasts and projections of Meridian for periods beyond 2022, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transaction on\nIndependent (including, without limitation, the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the\nTransaction), all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information), and we have assumed that all such information has been\nreasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the Independent and Meridian \u201cstreet estimates\u201d referred to above that such estimates are\nconsistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Independent management and that the forecasts, projections and estimates\nreflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated.\nIt is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of Independent and Meridian that was provided to us was not prepared with\nthe expectation of public disclosure and that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly available consensus \u201cstreet estimates\u201d of\nIndependent and Meridian referred to above, is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain (including, without limitation,\nfactors related to general economic and competitive conditions, and in particular, assumptions regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and,\naccordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions with the\nmanagement of Independent and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a reasonable basis upon which we can form our\nopinion, and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. Among other things, such information has assumed\nthat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact, which has been assumed to be limited, on Independent and Meridian. We have\nrelied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the\naccuracy or completeness thereof.\nWe also have assumed that there have been no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or\nprospects of either Independent or Meridian since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to us. We are not\nexperts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and we have assumed, without independent verification\nand with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Independent and Meridian are adequate to cover such losses. In\nrendering our opinion, we have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent\nor otherwise) of Independent or Meridian, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we\nexamined any individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Independent or Meridian under any state\nor federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be\nappraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and\nshould not be taken as our view of the actual value of any companies or assets.\nWe have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Transaction and any related transactions (including, without\nlimitation, the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of which we have\nassumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the execution version reviewed by us and referred to above), with no adjustments to\nthe Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of Meridian Common\n \nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company\n \nC-3\nTable of Contents\nThe Board of Directors \u2013 Independent Bank Corp.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 4 of 5\n \nStock\u037e (ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the\nAgreement are true and correct\u037e (iii) that each party to the Agreement and all related documents will perform all of the covenants and agreements required\nto be performed by such party under such documents\u037e (iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary\nregulatory or governmental approval for the Transaction or any related transactions and that all conditions to the completion of the Transaction and any\nrelated transactions will be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents\u037e and (v) that in the course of\nobtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Transaction and any related transactions, no restrictions,\nincluding any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse\neffect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Independent, Meridian or the pro forma entity or the contemplated benefits of the\nTransaction, including without limitation the cost savings, related expenses and operating synergies expected to result or be derived from the\nTransaction. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have\nfurther been advised by representatives of Independent that Independent has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate\nsources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to Independent, Meridian, the Transaction and any related\ntransaction and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.\nThis opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio in the Merger to Independent.\nWe express no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the Transaction or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the Bank\nMerger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any such related transaction, any consequences of the Transaction to\nIndependent, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support,\nshareholder, charitable giving or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Transaction, any\nsuch related transaction, or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof and the\ninformation made available to us through the date hereof. As you are aware, there is currently widespread disruption, extraordinary uncertainty and\nunusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of evolving governmental interventions and non-interventions.\nIt is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion reached in this opinion and that KBW does not have an obligation to update,\nrevise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address, and we express no view or opinion with respect to, (i) the underlying business decision of\nIndependent to engage in the Transaction or enter into the Agreement\u037e (ii) the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives\nthat are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by Independent or the Board\u037e (iii) any business, operational or other plans with respect to\nMeridian or the pro forma entity that may be currently contemplated by Independent or the Board or that may be implemented by Independent or the\nBoard subsequent to the closing of the Transaction\u037e (iv) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Independent\u2019s officers,\ndirectors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to any compensation to the holders of Independent Common Stock or relative to the\nExchange Ratio\u037e (v) the effect of the Transaction or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class\nof securities of Independent, Meridian or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Agreement\u037e (vi) the actual value of Independent\nCommon Stock to be issued in the Merger\u037e (vii) the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent Common Stock or Meridian Common Stock will\ntrade following the public announcement of the Transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Independent Common Stock will trade\nfollowing the consummation\n \nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company\n \nC-4\nTable of Contents\nThe Board of Directors \u2013 Independent Bank Corp.\nApril 22, 2021\nPage 5 of 5\n \nof the Merger\u037e (viii) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the Transaction or any other transaction contemplated\nby the Agreement\u037e or (ix) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Independent, Meridian, any of their respective shareholders\nor stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the Transaction or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger), including\nwhether or not the Transaction will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.\nThis opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial\nterms of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the Transaction or to any holder of\nIndependent Common Stock or any shareholder or stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the Transaction or any other\nmatter, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not any such shareholder or stockholder should enter into a voting, shareholders\u2019,\naffiliates\u2019 or other agreement with respect to the Transaction or exercise any dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder or\nstockholder.\nThis opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures established\nunder the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair, from a financial point\nof view, to Independent.\n \nVery truly yours,\nLOGO\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.\n \nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company\n \nC-5\nTable of Contents\nAnnex D",
