In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with\neach of the businesses of Prologis and Duke Realty because these risks will also affect the Combined\nCompany. These risks can be found in the respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prologis and Duke Realty, each of\nwhich is filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You\nshould also read and consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See \u201cWhere You Can Find\nMore Information and Incorporation by Reference\u201d beginning on page 174.\nRisks Related to the Mergers\nThe exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock prices of either Prologis\nor Duke Realty.\nUpon the closing of the company merger, each outstanding share of Duke Realty common stock (other than\nshares of Duke Realty common stock owned by any of the Duke Realty parties or any wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Duke Realty and each share of Duke Realty common stock owned by any of the Prologis\nparties or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.475\nof a share of Prologis common stock, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares, without interest. The\nexchange ratio of 0.475 was fixed in the merger agreement and, except for certain adjustments on account of\nchanges in the capitalization of Prologis or Duke Realty, will not be adjusted for changes in the market prices\nof shares of either Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock. Changes in the market price of\nshares of Prologis common stock prior to the closing of the company merger will affect the market value of\nthe merger consideration that Duke Realty shareholders will be entitled to receive upon completion of the\ncompany merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of either Prologis or Duke Realty), including the following factors:\nmarket reaction to the announcement of the mergers and the prospects of the Combined Company\u037e\nchanges in the respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities and prospects of Prologis, Duke\nRealty or the Combined Company\u037e\nchanges in market assessments of the business, operations, financial position and prospects of\nPrologis, Duke Realty or the Combined Company\u037e\nmarket assessments of the likelihood that the mergers will close\u037e\ninterest rates (including changes or anticipated changes in interest rates), general market and\neconomic conditions and other factors generally affecting the market prices of Prologis common stock\nand Duke Realty common stock\u037e\nfederal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses\nin which Prologis or Duke Realty operate\u037e and\nother factors beyond the control of either Prologis or Duke Realty, including those described or\nreferred to elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe market price of shares of Prologis common stock at the closing of the mergers may vary from its price on\nthe date the merger agreement was executed, on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, on the\ndate of the Prologis special meeting and on the date of the Duke Realty special meeting. As a result, the\nmarket value of the merger consideration represented by the exchange ratio will also vary. For example, based\non the range of trading prices of shares of Prologis common stock during the period after June 10, 2022, the\nlast trading day before Duke Realty and Prologis announced the merger agreement, through July 26, 2022,\nthe exchange ratio represented a market value ranging from $50.57 to $61.16 per share.\n28 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf the market price of shares of Prologis common stock increases between the date the merger agreement was\nsigned, the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date\nof the Duke Realty special meeting and the date of the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders\ncould receive shares of Prologis common stock that have a market value upon completion of the mergers that\nis greater than the market value of such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the\nmerger agreement was signed, the date of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis\nspecial meeting or the date of the Duke Realty special meeting, respectively. Conversely, if the market price\nof shares of Prologis common stock declines between the date the merger agreement was signed, the date of\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date of the Duke Realty\nspecial meeting and the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders could receive shares of Prologis\ncommon stock that have a market value upon the closing of the mergers that is less than the market value of\nsuch shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the merger agreement was signed, the date\nof this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date of the Duke\nRealty special meeting, respectively. Furthermore, at the time of the Prologis special meeting and the Duke\nRealty special meeting, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders will not know with certainty the\nvalue of the Prologis common stock that Duke Realty shareholders will receive upon completion of the\nmergers.\nTherefore, while the number of shares of Prologis common stock to be issued per share of Duke Realty\ncommon stock is fixed, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders cannot be sure of the market\nvalue of the merger consideration Duke Realty shareholders will receive upon the closing of the mergers.\nHolders of Prologis common stock and Duke Realty common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting\ninterest in the Combined Company after the mergers and will exercise less influence over management.\nThe mergers will result in Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders having an ownership stake in\nthe Combined Company that is smaller than their current stake in Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively, as\nof immediately prior to the mergers. Upon completion of the mergers, based on the number of shares of\nPrologis common stock and Duke Realty common stock outstanding on June 30, 2022, we estimate that\ncontinuing Prologis stockholders will own approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding common stock\nof the Combined Company, and former Duke Realty shareholders will own approximately 20% of the issued\nand outstanding common stock of the Combined Company. Consequently, Prologis stockholders and Duke\nRealty shareholders, as a general matter, will have less influence over the management and policies of the\nCombined Company after the company merger effective time than they currently exercise over the\nmanagement and policies of Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively.\nCompletion of the mergers is subject to many conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the\nmergers will not be completed, which could result in a requirement that Prologis or Duke Realty pay certain\ntermination fees.\nThe consummation of the mergers is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval of the merger\nagreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duke Realty common stock entitled to\nvote on such matter, (ii) the approval of the Prologis common stock issuance by the holders of a majority of\nvotes cast on such matter, (iii) the shares of Prologis common stock to be issued in the company merger\nhaving been approved for listing on the NYSE, (iv) the Form S-4 (of which this joint proxy statement/\u200b\nprospectus forms a part) having been declared effective, (v) the absence of any temporary restraining order,\ninjunction or other order, decree or judgment being issued by any governmental authority and no law being\nenacted, which would have the effect of making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the\nmergers, (vi) the receipt of certain legal opinions by Prologis and Duke Realty and (vii) other customary\nconditions specified in the merger agreement. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConditions to Completion of the\nMergers\u201d beginning on page 134.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the mergers will be satisfied or waived or\nthat the mergers will be completed. Failure to consummate the mergers may adversely affect Prologis\u2019 or\nDuke Realty\u2019s results of operations and business prospects for the following reasons, among others: (i) each\nof Prologis and Duke Realty have incurred and will incur certain transaction costs, regardless of whether the\nproposed mergers close, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and\nability\n29 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto make distributions to its stockholders or shareholders, respectively\u037e and (ii) the proposed mergers,\nwhether or not they close, will divert the attention of certain of each of Prologis\u2019 and Duke Realty\u2019s\nmanagement and other key employees from ongoing business activities, including the pursuit of other\nopportunities that could be beneficial to Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively. In addition, Duke Realty or\nPrologis may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if\nthe mergers are not completed by January 11, 2023.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Prologis\nmay be required to pay Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5 billion and/or reimburse Duke Realty\u2019s\ntransaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million, or Duke Realty may be required to pay Prologis a\ntermination fee of $775 million and/or reimburse Prologis\u2019 transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15\nmillion. If the mergers are not consummated, the price of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common\nstock might decline.\nFailure to complete the mergers could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial\nresults of Prologis or Duke Realty.\nIf the mergers are not completed, the ongoing business of Prologis or Duke Realty could be materially\nadversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the mergers, Prologis and\nDuke Realty will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the mergers, including\nthe following:\nthe market price of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock could decline\u037e\nPrologis being required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5\nbillion depending on the circumstances and/or reimburse Duke Realty\u2019s reasonable expenses up to\n$15 million or Duke Realty being required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Prologis a\ntermination fee of $775 million depending on the circumstances and/or reimburse Prologis\u2019 reasonable\nexpenses up to $15 million, as applicable\u037e\nif the merger agreement is terminated and the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board seeks another\nbusiness combination, Prologis stockholders or Duke Realty shareholders, respectively, cannot be\ncertain that Prologis or Duke Realty, respectively, will be able to find a party willing to enter into a\ntransaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Prologis and Duke Realty\nhave agreed to in the merger agreement\u037e\nPrologis or Duke Realty may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or its tenants,\nvendors or employees\u037e\nPrologis or Duke Realty having to pay certain costs relating to the mergers, such as legal, accounting,\nfinancial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees whether or not the mergers are completed\u037e and\ndiversion of Prologis\u2019 or Duke Realty\u2019s management focus and resources from operational matters and\nother strategic opportunities while working to implement the mergers.\nIf the mergers are not completed, these risks could materially affect the business, financial results and share\nprice of Prologis or Duke Realty. In addition, if the mergers are not completed, Prologis or Duke Realty could\nbe subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the mergers or related to any enforcement\nproceeding commenced against Prologis or Duke Realty to perform its obligations under the merger\nagreement. The materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact Prologis\u2019 or Duke Realty\u2019s\nongoing business.\nThe pendency of the mergers could adversely affect the business and operations of Prologis or Duke Realty.\nPrior to the effective time of the mergers, some tenants, prospective tenants or vendors of Prologis or Duke\nRealty may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect the revenues, earnings, cash flows and\nexpenses of Prologis or Duke Realty, regardless of whether the mergers are completed. Similarly, current and\nprospective employees of Duke Realty may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the\nCombined Company following the mergers, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Duke Realty\nto attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the mergers. In addition, due to operating\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrestrictions in the merger agreement, Prologis and Duke Realty may be unable, during the pendency of the\nmergers, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant\nfinancing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions, even if such actions would prove beneficial.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire all or a significant\nportion of Prologis or Duke Realty prior to the mergers.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, each of Prologis and Duke Realty has agreed not to (i) solicit proposals\nrelating to certain alternative transactions, (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations or provide non-public\ninformation in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party or (iii) approve\nor enter into any agreements providing for any such alternative transaction, in each case, subject to certain\nexceptions to permit members of the Prologis board and the Duke Realty board to comply with their duties as\ndirectors under applicable law. Notwithstanding these \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions, prior to obtaining the Prologis\nstockholder approval or the Duke Realty shareholder approval, as applicable, under specified circumstances\nthe Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, respectively, may change its recommendation of the\ntransaction, and Duke Realty may also terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal upon\npayment of the termination fee described below.\nThe merger agreement provides that, in connection with the termination of the merger agreement under\nspecified circumstances, Prologis may be required to pay to Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5 billion\nand/or reimburse Duke Realty\u2019s transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million and Duke Realty\nmay be required to pay to Prologis a termination fee of $775 million and/or reimburse Prologis\u2019 transaction\nexpenses up to an amount equal to $15 million. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f Covenants and Agreements\u202f-\u202f\nNo Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 138.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all\nor a significant part of Prologis or Duke Realty from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if\nthe potential competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the\nvalue proposed to be received or realized in the mergers, or might result in a potential competing acquirer\nproposing to pay a lower per share value than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added\nexpense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the merger\nagreement.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and Prologis or Duke Realty determines to seek another business\ncombination, Prologis or Duke Realty, respectively, may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another\nparty on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement.\nIf the mergers are not consummated by January 11, 2023, either Prologis or Duke Realty may terminate the merger\nagreement.\nEither Prologis or Duke Realty may terminate the merger agreement if the mergers have not been\nconsummated by January 11, 2023. However, this termination right will not be available to a party if that party\nfailed to comply with the merger agreement and that failure was the primary cause of, or resulted in, the\nfailure to consummate the mergers on or before January 11, 2023. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f Termination\nof the Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 136.\nSome of the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty have interests in the mergers that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, those of the other Duke Realty shareholders.\nIn considering whether to approve the merger agreement and the transasctions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders should recognize that members of management and the\nDuke Realty board have interests in the mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of other\nDuke Realty shareholders. Some of the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty have\narrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those\ngenerally of the Duke Realty shareholders. These interests, among other things, may influence or may have\ninfluenced the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty to support or approve the merger\n31 \n",

Although the\nCombined Company anticipates that it will pay off its mortgage payables as soon as prepayment penalties\nand other costs make it economically feasible to do so, the Combined Company cannot anticipate when such\npayment will occur.\nThe future results of the Combined Company will suffer if the Combined Company does not effectively manage its\nexpanded operations following the mergers.\nFollowing the mergers, the Combined Company expects to continue to expand its operations through\nadditional acquisitions and development of properties, some of which may involve complex challenges. The\nfuture success of the Combined Company will depend, in part, upon the ability of the Combined Company to\nmanage its expansion opportunities, which may pose substantial challenges for the Combined Company to\nintegrate new operations into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, and upon its ability to\nsuccessfully monitor its operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain other\nnecessary internal controls. There is no assurance that the Combined Company\u2019s expansion or acquisition\nopportunities will be successful, or that the Combined Company will realize its expected operating\nefficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.\nCounterparties to certain significant agreements with Duke Realty may exercise contractual rights under such\nagreements in connection with the mergers.\nDuke Realty is a party to certain agreements that give the counterparty certain rights following a \u201cchange in\ncontrol,\u201d including in some cases the right to terminate the agreement. Under some such agreements, the\nmergers may constitute a change in control, and therefore the counterparty may exercise certain rights under\nthe agreement upon the closing of the mergers. Any such counterparty may request modifications of their\nrespective agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under their agreement. The pursuit of\nsuch rights by the counterparties may result in the Combined Company suffering a loss of potential future\nrevenue or incurring liabilities and may result in the loss of rights that are material to the Combined\nCompany\u2019s business. There can be no assurances that such counterparties will not exercise their rights\nunder these agreements, including termination rights where available, or that the exercise of any such rights\nunder, or modification of, these agreements will not adversely affect the business or operations of the\nCombined Company.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Combined Company Common Stock Following the Mergers\nThe market price and trading volume of the Combined Company common stock may be volatile.\nThe Combined Company\u2019s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations, and\ninvestors in shares of the Combined Company common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their\nshares, including decreases unrelated to the Combined Company\u2019s operating performance or prospects.\nPrologis and Duke Realty cannot assure you that the market price of the Combined Company common stock\nwill not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIn addition to the risks listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, a number of factors could negatively affect the\nCombined Company\u2019s share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Combined\nCompany common stock, including:\nthe annual yield from distributions on the Combined Company common stock as compared to yields\non other financial instruments\u037e\nequity issuances by the Combined Company, or future sales of substantial amounts of the Combined\nCompany common stock by its existing or future stockholders, or the perception that such issuances\nor future sales may occur\u037e\n34 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nincreases in market interest rates or a decrease in the Combined Company\u2019s distributions to\nstockholders that lead purchasers of the Combined Company common stock to demand a higher\nyield\u037e\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies\u037e\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes\u037e\nadditions or departures of key management personnel\u037e\nthe Combined Company\u2019s operating performance and the performance of other similar companies\u037e\nactual or anticipated differences in the Combined Company\u2019s quarterly operating results\u037e\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities\nanalysts\u037e\npublication of research reports about the Combined Company or its industry by securities analysts\u037e\nfailure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes\u037e\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness the Combined Company incurs in the future\u037e\nstrategic decisions by the Combined Company or its competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments,\nspin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy\u037e\nthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect the Combined\nCompany or its industry or any failure by the Combined Company to comply with regulatory\nrequirements\u037e\nthe expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives\u037e\nthe imposition of a penalty tax as a result of certain property transfers that may generate prohibited\ntransaction income\u037e\nthe inability of the Combined Company to sell properties if and when it would be appropriate to do\nso\u037e\nrisks and liabilities in connection with the Combined Company\u2019s co-investment ventures and\ninvestment in new or existing co-investment ventures, including that the Combined Company\u2019s\nproperty ownership through joint ventures may limit its ability to act exclusively in its interests and\nmay depend on the financial performance of its co-venturers\u037e\nspeculation in the press or investment community\u037e\nchanges in the Combined Company\u2019s earnings\u037e\nfailure to satisfy the listing requirements of the NYSE\u037e\nfailure to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u037e\nactions by institutional stockholders of the Combined Company\u037e\nchanges in accounting principles\u037e\nchanges in environmental conditions or the potential impact of climate change\u037e\nterrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war in areas in which the Combined Company\u2019s properties\nare located or markets on which the Combined Company\u2019s securities are traded\u037e and\ngeneral economic and/or market conditions, including factors unrelated to the Combined Company\u2019s\nperformance.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of\nvolatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and\ndivert the Combined Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse\neffect on the Combined Company\u2019s cash flows, its ability to execute its business strategy and the Combined\nCompany\u2019s ability to make distributions to its stockholders.\n35 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe market price of shares of the common stock of the Combined Company may be affected by factors different from\nthose affecting the prices of shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock before the mergers.\nThe results of operations of the Combined Company, as well as the market price of the common stock of the\nCombined Company, after the mergers may be affected by other factors in addition to those currently\naffecting Prologis\u2019 or Duke Realty\u2019s results of operations and the market prices of Prologis common stock\nand Duke Realty common stock. These factors include:\na greater number of shares of the Combined Company common stock outstanding as compared to the\nnumber of currently outstanding shares of Prologis common stock\u037e\ndifferent stockholders\u037e and\ndifferent assets and capitalizations.\nAccordingly, the historical market prices and financial results of Prologis and Duke Realty may not be\nindicative for the Combined Company after the mergers. For a discussion of the businesses of Prologis and\nDuke Realty and certain risks to consider in connection with investing in those businesses, see the\ndocuments incorporated by reference by Prologis and Duke Realty into this joint proxy statement/\u200b\nprospectus referred to under \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference\u201d\nbeginning on page 174.\nThe market price of the Combined Company common stock may decline as a result of the mergers.\nThe market price of the Combined Company common stock may decline as a result of the mergers if the\nCombined Company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the mergers as rapidly or to the extent\nanticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of the mergers on the Combined Company\u2019s\nfinancial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nIn addition, upon consummation of the mergers, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders will\nown interests in a Combined Company operating an expanded business with a different mix of properties,\nrisks and liabilities. Current Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders may not wish to continue to\ninvest in the Combined Company, or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their shares of\nthe Combined Company common stock. If, following the company merger effective time, large amounts of the\nCombined Company common stock are sold, the price of the Combined Company common stock could\ndecline.\nAfter the mergers are completed, Duke Realty shareholders that receive shares of Prologis common stock in the\ncompany merger will have different rights that may be less favorable than their current rights as Duke Realty\nshareholders.\nAfter the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders that receive shares of Prologis common stock in\nthe company merger will have different rights than they currently have as Duke Realty shareholders. For a\ndetailed discussion of the similarities and material differences between the current rights you have as a Duke\nRealty shareholder and the rights you will have as a stockholder of the Combined Company following the\nmergers, see \u201cComparison of Rights of the Prologis Stockholders and the Duke Realty Shareholders\u201d\nbeginning on page 154.\nThe Combined Company cannot assure you that it will be able to continue paying dividends at or above the rates\ncurrently paid by Prologis and Duke Realty.\nThe stockholders of the Combined Company may not receive dividends at the same rate they received\ndividends as Prologis stockholders and as Duke Realty shareholders following the mergers for various\nreasons, including the following:\nthe Combined Company may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in the\nCombined Company\u2019s cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position\u037e\n36 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndecisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all\ntimes entirely at the discretion of the Combined Company\u2019s board of directors, which reserves the\nright to change Prologis\u2019 current dividend practices at any time and for any reason\u037e\nthe Combined Company may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve its credit ratings\u037e and\nthe amount of dividends that the Combined Company\u2019s subsidiaries may distribute to the Combined\nCompany may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law and restrictions imposed by the terms\nof any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.\nStockholders of the Combined Company will have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have\nnot been declared by the Combined Company\u2019s board of directors.\nThe Combined Company may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nIn connection with executing the Combined Company\u2019s business strategies following the mergers, the\nCombined Company expects to evaluate the possibility of additional acquisitions and strategic investments,\nand the Combined Company may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness. The\namount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for the Combined Company,\nincluding hindering the Combined Company\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic\nconditions\u037e limiting the Combined Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt\nor to fund acquisitions or emerging businesses\u037e limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future\noperations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses\u037e making the Combined Company more\nvulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases\u037e and placing the Combined\nCompany at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.\nThe historical and unaudited pro forma combined financial information included elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus may not be representative of the Combined Company\u2019s results following the mergers, and\naccordingly, you have limited financial information on which to evaluate the Combined Company.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information included elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative\nof the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the mergers been\ncompleted as of the date indicated, nor is it indicative of the future operating results or financial position of\nthe Combined Company. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect future\nevents that may occur after the company merger effective time, including the costs related to the planned\nintegration of the two companies and any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the mergers, and does\nnot consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies. The\nunaudited pro forma combined financial information presented elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the mergers that Prologis and Duke\nRealty believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Prologis and Duke Realty cannot assure you that the\nassumptions will prove to be accurate over time.\nThe Combined Company may incur adverse tax consequences if Prologis or Duke Realty has failed or fails to\nqualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes.\nEach of Prologis and Duke Realty has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a REIT\nfor United States federal income tax purposes under the Code and each intends to continue to do so through\nthe closing date or the moment in time immediately prior to the company merger effective time, respectively.\nThe Combined Company intends to continue operating in such a manner following the mergers. The closing\nof the mergers is conditioned on the receipt by Prologis of an opinion of Duke Realty\u2019s counsel to the effect\nthat Duke Realty has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification\nand taxation as a REIT under the Code, and on the receipt by Duke Realty of an opinion of Prologis\u2019 counsel\nto the effect that Prologis has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for\nqualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and Prologis\u2019 proposed method of organization and\noperation will enable it to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under\nthe Code. The foregoing REIT opinions, however, are limited to the factual representations provided by\nPrologis and Duke Realty to counsel and the assumptions set forth therein, and\n37 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nare not a guarantee that Prologis or Duke Realty, in fact, has qualified or that the Combined Company will\ncontinue to qualify as a REIT. Moreover, neither Duke Realty nor Prologis has requested or plans to request\na ruling from the IRS that it qualifies as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly\ntechnical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative\ninterpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations is greater\nin the case of a REIT, like Prologis, that holds assets through a partnership and that has substantial foreign\noperations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within Duke Realty\u2019s\nand Prologis\u2019 control may affect their ability to qualify as REITs.\nIf Prologis or Duke Realty (or, following the mergers, the Combined Company) loses its REIT status, or is\ndetermined to have lost its REIT status in a prior year, it will face serious tax consequences that would\nsubstantially reduce its cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to its\nstockholders or shareholders, respectively, because:\nit would be subject to United States federal income tax on its net income at regular corporate rates for\nthe years it did not qualify for taxation as a REIT (and, for such years, would not be allowed a\ndeduction for dividends paid to stockholders or shareholders, respectively, in computing its taxable\nincome)\u037e\nit could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes\nfor such periods\u037e\nunless it is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any \u201csuccessor\u201d\ncompany could elect to be taxed as a REIT until the fifth taxable year following the year during which\nit was disqualified\u037e and\nfor five years following re-election of REIT status, upon a taxable disposition of an asset owned as of\nsuch re-election, it could be subject to corporate level tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in\nsuch asset at the time of re-election.\nAs a result of all these factors, Prologis\u2019 or Duke Realty\u2019s (or following the mergers, the Combined\nCompany\u2019s) failure to qualify as a REIT could impair the Combined Company\u2019s ability to expand its business\nand raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of its capital stock.\nIn certain circumstances, even if the Combined Company qualifies as a REIT, it and its subsidiaries may be subject\nto certain United States federal, state, and other taxes, which would reduce the Combined Company\u2019s cash available\nfor distribution to its stockholders.\nEven if the Combined Company has qualified and continues to qualify as a REIT, it may be subject to some\nfederal, state and local taxes on its income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event\nit sells property as a dealer. In addition, the Combined Company\u2019s domestic corporate subsidiaries that are\ntaxable REIT subsidiaries could be subject to federal and state taxes, and its foreign properties and\ncompanies are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are located. Any federal, state or\nother taxes the Combined Company pays will reduce its cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nIf Prologis OP is classified as a \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d under the Code, the Combined Company\u2019s status as a\nREIT and its ability to pay distributions to the Combined Company\u2019s stockholders could be adversely affected.\nPrologis OP is organized as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Even though\nPrologis OP will not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation, it may be taxed as a\ncorporation if it is deemed to be a \u201cpublicly traded partnership.\u201d A publicly traded partnership is a\npartnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are considered readily tradable\non a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Prologis believes and currently takes the\nposition that Prologis OP should not be classified as a publicly traded partnership because interests in\nPrologis OP are not traded on an established securities market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and\nPrologis OP should satisfy certain safe harbors, which prevent a partnership\u2019s interests from being treated as\nreadily tradable on an established securities market or substantial equivalent thereof. No assurance can be\ngiven, however, that the IRS would not assert that Prologis OP constitutes a publicly traded partnership or\nthat facts\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand circumstances will not develop which could result in Prologis OP being treated as a publicly traded\npartnership. If the IRS were to assert successfully that Prologis OP is a publicly traded partnership, and\nsubstantially all of Prologis OP\u2019s gross income did not consist of specified types of passive income, Prologis\nOP would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation and would be subject to corporate tax at the\nentity level. In such event, the character of the Combined Company\u2019s assets and items of gross income\nwould change and would result in a termination of the Combined Company\u2019s status as a REIT. In addition,\nthe imposition of a corporate tax on Prologis OP would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution\nto the Combined Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Combined Company depends on key personnel for its future success, and the loss of key personnel or inability to\nattract and retain personnel could harm the Combined Company\u2019s business.\nThe members of the Prologis board, together with James B. Connor, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nof Duke Realty, and Prologis\u2019 executive officers will continue as the members of the board and executive\nmanagement of the Combined Company. The future success of the Combined Company depends in large part\non its ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. The future success of the\nCombined Company also depends upon the service of the Combined Company\u2019s executive officers, who\nhave extensive market knowledge and relationships and will exercise substantial influence over the\nCombined Company\u2019s operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. Among the reasons that\nthey are important to the Combined Company\u2019s success is that each has a national or regional industry\nreputation that is expected to attract business and investment opportunities and assist the Combined\nCompany in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants and industry personnel.\nMany of the Combined Company\u2019s other key executive personnel, particularly its senior managers, also have\nextensive experience and strong reputations in the industry. In particular, the extent and nature of the\nrelationships that these individuals have developed with financial institutions and existing and prospective\ncustomers is critically important to the success of the Combined Company\u2019s business. The loss of services\nof one or more members of the Combined Company\u2019s senior management team, or the Combined Company\u2019s\ninability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect the Combined Company\u2019s\nbusiness, diminish the Combined Company\u2019s investment opportunities and weaken its relationships with\nlenders, business partners, existing and prospective customers and industry personnel, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Combined Company.\nPrologis and Duke Realty face other risks.\nThe foregoing risks are not exhaustive, and you should be aware that, following the mergers, the Combined\nCompany will face various other risks, including those discussed in reports filed by Prologis and Duke\nRealty with the SEC.

All\nstatements that address operating performance, events or developments that Prologis or Duke Realty expect\nor anticipate will occur in the future - including statements relating to the potential benefits of the proposed\nmergers, the expected timing to complete the proposed mergers, rent and occupancy growth, acquisition and\ndevelopment activity, contribution and disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where\nPrologis and Duke Realty operate, Prologis\u2019 and Duke Realty\u2019s respective debt, capital structure and\nfinancial position, Prologis\u2019 and Duke Realty\u2019s respective ability to earn revenues from co-investment\nventures, form new co-investment ventures and the availability of capital in existing or new co-investment\nventures - are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and\ninvolve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although Prologis and Duke\nRealty believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable\nassumptions, neither Prologis nor Duke Realty can give assurance that these expectations will be attained,\nand therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such\nforward-looking statements.

For a summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the\ninformation about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus,\nincluding the information set forth in the sections entitled \u201cThe Mergers\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d. A\ncopy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, approval of this proposal is a condition to the consummation of the\nmergers. If this proposal is not approved, the mergers will not be completed.\nApproval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of\nDuke Realty common stock entitled to vote on such proposal.\nRecommendation of the Duke Realty Board of Directors\nThe Duke Realty board unanimously recommends that Duke Realty shareholders vote FOR the Duke Realty merger\nagreement proposal.\nDuke Realty Compensation Proposal\n(Proposal 2 on the Duke Realty Proxy Card)\nThe Duke Realty shareholders are being asked to consider and vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to\napprove the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Duke Realty named executive officers.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Section 14A of the\nExchange Act, Duke Realty is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory\nvote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Duke Realty\u2019s named executive officers, as\ndetermined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, that is based upon or otherwise relates to the\nmergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and arises from any form of\narrangement or understanding, whether written or unwritten, between Duke Realty or the Combined\nCompany and the named executive officers of Duke Realty. Duke Realty therefore is asking its shareholders\nto vote on the adoption of the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Duke Realty Corporation\u2019s\nnamed executive officers in connection with the mergers and the agreements or understandings\npursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed\npursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in \u201cThe Mergers - Interests of Duke Realty\u2019s Directors and\nNamed Executive Officers in the Mergers\u201d is hereby APPROVED.\u201d\nVote Required\nThe vote regarding the Duke Realty compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the\nDuke Realty merger agreement proposal. Because the vote regarding merger-related compensation is\nadvisory only, it will not be binding on either Duke Realty or Prologis regardless of whether the mergers are\ncompleted. Accordingly, if the mergers are completed, the merger-related compensation will become payable\nin connection with the mergers and a qualifying termination of employment, subject only to the conditions\napplicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this non-binding advisory vote.\nAssuming a quorum is present, approval of the Duke Realty compensation proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of all votes cast on such proposal.\n54 ",

transactions, including the business,\ncompetition, industry and market risks that would apply to Duke Realty and the mergers, as compared\nto potential alternatives, including the continued independent operation of Duke Realty and Duke\nRealty\u2019s prospects for a merger or sale transaction with a company other than Prologis and the\npotential terms for such other transactions as more

conducted at arm\u2019s length and during which the\nDuke Realty board was advised by its legal and financial advisors, including that the negotiations\nresulted in an improved offer.\nThe Duke Realty board also considered a number of risks and other potentially negative factors in\nconsidering the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the following:\nfollowing the completion of the company merger, Duke Realty would no longer exist as an\nindependent public company and Duke Realty shareholders would be able to participate in any future\nearnings growth Duke Realty might have achieved solely through their ownership of Prologis\ncommon stock\u037e\nbecause the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Prologis common stock that\nwill not fluctuate as a result of changes in the market price of Duke Realty common stock or Prologis\ncommon stock prior to the company merger effective time, the market value of the merger\nconsideration could decrease prior to the company merger effective time if the trading price of\nPrologis common stock decreases\u037e\nthe risk that the anticipated cost and long-term revenue synergies and other benefits to the Duke\nRealty shareholders expected to result from the mergers might not be fully realized or not realized at\nall, including as a result of possible changes in the real estate market or the industrial real estate\nbusiness affecting the markets in which the Combined Company will operate or as a result of potential\ndifficulties integrating the two companies and their respective operations\u037e\nthe risk that a different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to Duke Realty\nshareholders than the proposed mergers\u037e\nunder the terms of the merger agreement, Duke Realty must pay to Prologis a termination fee in an\namount of $775 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, which might\ndiscourage or deter other parties from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more\nadvantageous to Duke Realty shareholders\u037e\nunder the terms of the merger agreement, if Duke Realty shareholders vote on, but do not approve,\nthe company merger, and the merger agreement is thereafter terminated, Duke Realty may be required\nto reimburse Prologis\u2019 transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million, regardless of\nwhether an alternative transaction is available to Duke Realty\u037e\nthe terms of the merger agreement place limitations on the ability of Duke Realty to solicit, initiate,\nknowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer by\nor with a third party with respect to a competing

In view of the wide variety of\nfactors considered by the Duke Realty board in evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the company merger, and the complexity of these matters,\nthe Duke Realty board did not attempt to quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights\nto the factors that it considered. In addition, individual members of the Duke Realty board may have given\ndiffering weights to different factors. The Duke Realty board conducted an overall review of the factors\ndescribed above and other factors, including through discussions with, and inquiry of, Duke Realty\u2019s\nmanagement and outside legal counsel and financial advisors.\nAfter consideration of these factors, the Duke Realty board determined that, overall, the potential benefits of\nthe mergers outweighed the potential risks. Accordingly, the Duke Realty board determined that the mergers\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of\nDuke Realty and its shareholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the mergers. The Duke Realty board unanimously recommends that the\nDuke Realty shareholders vote FOR the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal.\nOpinion of Prologis\u2019 Financial Advisor\nAt a meeting of the Prologis board, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Prologis board its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion dated June 11, 2022, to the effect that, as of the\n73 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndate of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set\nforth in Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to Prologis.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated June 11, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with\nthe opinion, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. The summary of the Goldman Sachs\nopinion contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and\nassistance of the Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the mergers and the opinion does not\nconstitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Prologis common stock should vote with respect to the\nPrologis common stock issuance proposal or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,\nGoldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\nthe merger agreement\u037e\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Prologis and Duke Realty for the\nfive years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prologis and Duke\nRealty\u037e\ncertain other communications from Prologis and Duke Realty to their respective stockholders\u037e\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Prologis and Duke Realty\u037e\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Duke Realty on a standalone basis prepared by its\nmanagement\u037e and\ncertain financial analyses and forecasts for Duke Realty on a standalone basis and giving effect to\nthe company merger and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Prologis on a standalone\nand on a pro-forma basis giving effect to the company merger, in each case, as prepared by the\nmanagement of Prologis and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Prologis, which collectively we\nrefer to in this section as the \u201cForecasts\u201d, including certain operating synergies projected by the\nmanagement of Prologis to result from the company merger, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by\nPrologis, which we refer to in this section as the \u201cSynergies\u201d  (as described in the sections entitled \u201c-\nCertain Prologis Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d and \u201c- Certain Duke Realty Unaudited\nPrologis Prospective Financial Information).\u201d\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Prologis and Duke Realty\nregarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future\nprospects of Duke Realty and with the members of senior management of Prologis regarding their\nassessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Prologis\nand the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the company merger\u037e reviewed the reported price\nand trading activity for the shares of Prologis common stock and shares of Duke Realty common stock\u037e\ncompared certain financial and stock market information for Prologis and Duke Realty with similar information\nfor certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain\nrecent business combinations in the real estate industry\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses,\nand considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Prologis board, relied upon\nand assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and\nother information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any\nresponsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent\nof the Prologis board that the Forecasts, including the Synergies, were reasonably prepared on a basis\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Prologis. Goldman\nSachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any\ncontingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty\nor Duke Realty OP or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any\n74 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents\nand approvals necessary for the consummation of the company merger would be obtained without any\nadverse effect on Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty, Duke Realty OP or on the expected benefits of the\ncompany merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the\ncompany merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver\nor modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Prologis to engage in the\ncompany merger, or the relative merits of the company merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that\nmay be available to Prologis\u037e nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view to Prologis, as of the date of\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs did\nnot express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement\nor the company merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the\nmerger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the company merger, including, the\npartnership merger, the contribution, any distribution to the stockholders of Prologis, or the fairness of the\ncompany merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of\nsecurities, creditors or other constituencies of Prologis\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any\ncompensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Prologis, Prologis OP,\nDuke Realty or Duke Realty OP, or any class of such persons, in connection with the company merger,\nwhether relative to the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not\nexpress any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock\nwould trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on\nPrologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP, or as to the impact of the company merger on the\nsolvency or viability of Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP or the ability of Prologis,\nPrologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP to pay their respective obligations when they come due.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in\neffect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs, as of, the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written\nopinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion\nbased on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the\nPrologis board in connection with its consideration of the company merger and Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\ndoes not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Prologis common stock should vote\nwith respect to the company merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of Goldman Sachs.\nFollowing Goldman Sachs\u2019 presentation to the Prologis board of directors on June 11, 2022, which we refer to\nin this section as the \u201cJune 11 Presentation,\u201d Goldman Sachs determined that certain items affecting the\ndiscounted cash flow analyses and the present value of future share price analyses, on both a standalone\nand pro forma basis, needed to be adjusted. These adjustments primarily related to (i) discount periods not\nfully corresponding with the timing of cash flows and (ii) a misapplication of Duke Realty\u2019s forward EBITDA\n(as defined below) growth in the Duke Realty standalone terminal value calculation. Goldman Sachs\nsubsequently performed such analyses, as of June 11, 2022, using the adjusted calculations, which we refer\nto in this section as the \u201cAdjusted Calculations.\u201d Such subsequent analyses performed by Goldman Sachs\ndo not address any circumstances, developments or events occurring after June 11, 2022, which is the date\nof the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, other than in relation to the Adjusted Calculations and, except as\ndescribed herein, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion set forth in its written opinion letter was provided only as of such\ndate. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, on July 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs confirmed to the Prologis\nboard that, had Goldman Sachs performed its financial analysis set forth in the June 11 Presentation using\nthe Adjusted Calculations, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in the written\nopinion of Goldman Sachs dated June 11, 2022.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Prologis\nboard of directors in connection with rendering to the Prologis board the opinion described above. The\nfollowing summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses\n75 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperformed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or\nweight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include\ninformation presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary\nand are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted,\nthe following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data\nas it existed on or before June 10, 2022, the last trading day prior to Goldman Sachs\u2019 delivery of its opinion to\nthe Prologis board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Premia\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia using the closing price for shares of Prologis\ncommon stock and Duke Realty common stock on June 10, 2022, and the implied value of the merger\nconsideration to be paid by Prologis for each share of Duke Realty common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement.\nFor purposes of its analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated implied values for the merger consideration of (a)\n$58.85 by multiplying the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement by $123.90, an illustrative equity\nvalue per share of Prologis common stock calculated as the closing price for the shares of Prologis common\nstock on May 9, 2022, the last trading day before Prologis announced its offer to acquire Duke Realty,\nadjusted to track the average share price performance of the selected companies set forth below under \u201c-\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\u201d since such date through June 10, 2022, which we refer to in\nthis section as the \u201cPrologis Peer-Adjusted Unaffected Price,\u201d and (b) $55.69 by multiplying the exchange\nratio pursuant to the merger agreement by $117.24, the closing price for the shares of Prologis common stock\non June 10, 2022.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and/or compared the implied premia represented by the $58.85 and $55.69 implied\nvalues of the merger consideration described in the previous paragraph, relative to:\n$44.66, an illustrative equity value per share of Duke Realty common stock calculated as the closing\nprice for the shares of Duke Realty common stock on May 9, 2022, adjusted to reflect the average\nshare price performance of the selected companies set forth below under \u201c- Selected Publicly Traded\nCompanies Analysis\u201d since such date through June 10, 2022, which we refer to in this section as the\n\u201cDuke Realty Peer-Adjusted Unaffected Price\u201d\u037e\n$65.64, the highest closing price for shares of Duke Realty common stock over the 52-week period\nended May 9, 2022\u037e and\n$67.00, the median broker price target on May 9, 2022.\nThe results of these calculations were as follows:\nImplied Premium/(Discount) to:\nValue of Offer \nBased on\nPrologis \nPeer Adjusted \nUnaffected\nPrice\nValue of Offer \nBased on\nLatest \nPrologis\nClosing \nPrice \nOn 10-June-\n22\nDuke Realty Peer-Adjusted Unaffected Price of $44.66\n31.8\n24.7\nDuke Realty 52-Week High of $65.64\n(10.3\n(15.2\nMedian Broker Price Target of $67.00\n(12.2\n(16.9\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Duke Realty on a Standalone Basis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Duke Realty\nto derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock, both without taking\ninto account the Synergies and taking into account the Synergies.\nUsing discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of Duke Realty\u2019s weighted average cost\nof capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common\nstock, by discounting to present value as of March 31, 2022, (i) estimates of the unlevered free cash flows to\nbe generated by Duke Realty on a standalone basis, both without taking into account the\n76 \n%\n%\n)%\n)%\n)%\n)%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSynergies and taking into account the Synergies, for the period from April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026, as\nreflected in the Forecasts, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Duke Realty, as of December 31,\n2026, calculated by applying exit terminal year multiples ranging from 25.0x to 28.0x to estimated 1-year\nforward adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which we refer to in this\nsection as \u201cEBITDA,\u201d to be generated by Duke Realty, both without taking into account the Synergies and\ntaking into account the Synergies, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied (i) as set forth in the\nJune 11 Presentation, perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.3% both without taking into account\nthe Synergies and taking into account the Synergies and (ii) using the Adjusted Calculations, perpetuity\ngrowth rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.7% without taking into account the Synergies, and 3.4% to 4.6% taking\ninto account the Synergies). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset\npricing model (\u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Duke Realty\u2019s target\ncapital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any,\nfuture applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Duke Realty, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally. The range of exit terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman\nSachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience taking into account historical trading multiples of\nPrologis and Duke Realty and the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth below under \u201c-\nSelected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis\u201d.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Duke Realty by adding the ranges of\npresent values it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described\nabove. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived the net\ndebt of Duke Realty as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Duke Realty\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of that\ndate, to derive ranges of illustrative equity values for Duke Realty, both without taking into account the\nSynergies and taking into account the Synergies. Goldman Sachs then divided the ranges of illustrative\nequity values it derived for Duke Realty on a standalone basis by the implied number of fully diluted shares\nof Duke Realty common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Duke Realty\nmanagement, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock. As set\nforth in the June 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of\nDuke Realty common stock of $55.35 to $67.92 without taking into account the Synergies, and a range of\nillustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of $66.00 to $80.11 taking into account the\nSynergies. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per\nshare of Duke Realty common stock of $61.55 to $75.57 without taking into account the Synergies, and a\nrange of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of $72.86 to $88.59 taking into\naccount the Synergies.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis for Duke Realty on a Standalone Basis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of\nDuke Realty common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of\nDuke Realty common stock.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Duke Realty common\nstock as of December 31 of each of 2022 through 2025 by applying price to next twelve months\u2019 AFFO\nmultiples ranging from 27.0x to 33.0x to estimates of the AFFO per share of Duke Realty for each of fiscal\nyears 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, as reflected in the Forecasts. By applying a discount rate of\n8.2%, reflecting an estimate of Duke Realty\u2019s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as\nof March 31, 2022, and summed, both the theoretical future values per share of Duke Realty common stock it\nderived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of Duke Realty common\nstock on a standalone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the Forecasts, to yield\nillustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock. As set forth in the June 11 Presentation,\nthis analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of\n$49.91 to $67.38. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of Duke Realty common stock of $49.64 to $70.54.\nThe illustrative price to next twelve months\u2019 AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by\nGoldman Sachs using its professional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated\nby Goldman Sachs as set forth below under \u201c- Selected Publicly Traded Companies\n77 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnalysis.\u201d Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the\nCAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Duke Realty, as well as certain\nfinancial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nIllustrative Implied Premia of Precedent REIT Transactions\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in certain\nacquisition transactions of publicly traded real estate investment trust companies in the United States and\nCanada announced since 2017 in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of greater than\n$500 million (excluding the Blackstone Group / Bluerock Residential Growth REIT transaction and the Pretium\n& Ares Management / Front Yard Residential transaction).\nFor the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the yearly average,\nhigh and low premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the closing stock prices of the target\ninvolved in the transaction on the trading day prior to the date on which such transaction was announced or\na news report, management commentary, public filing, or other public disclosure regarding such transaction\noccurred, which we refer to as the \u201cUnaffected date.\u201d The following table presents the results of this\nanalysis:\nPremia to Share Price on \nUnaffected

Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by\napplication of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Prologis\u2019s target capital\nstructure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future\napplicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Prologis, as well as certain financial metrics for the United\nStates financial markets generally. The range of exit terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs\nutilizing its professional judgment and experience taking into account historical trading multiples of Prologis\nand Duke Realty and the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c- Selected\nPublicly Traded Companies Analysis.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Prologis by adding the ranges of present\nvalues it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived (i) for Prologis on\na standalone basis, the net debt of Prologis as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Prologis\u2019s consolidated\nbalance sheet as of that date, and (ii) for Prologis pro forma giving effect to the transaction, the net debt of\nPrologis as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Prologis\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of that date and the\nnet debt of Duke Realty as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Duke Realty\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of\nthat date, to derive ranges of illustrative equity values for Prologis, both on a standalone basis and pro\nforma giving effect to the transaction. Goldman Sachs then divided the ranges of illustrative equity values it\nderived, (i) for Prologis on a standalone basis, by the implied number of fully diluted shares of Prologis\ncommon stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Prologis management, and (ii)\nfor Prologis pro forma giving effect to the transaction, by the implied number of fully diluted shares of\nPrologis common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Prologis management,\nplus the estimated number of shares of Prologis common stock to be issued as merger consideration, as\nprovided by Prologis management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis\ncommon stock on a standalone basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction. As set forth\nin the June 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis\ncommon stock on a standalone basis of $167.27 to $197.82, and a range of illustrative present values per\nshare of Prologis common stock on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction of $169.60 to $200.88.\nUsing the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of\nPrologis common stock on a standalone basis of $159.36 to $189.71, and a range of illustrative present values\nper share of Prologis common stock on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction of $161.21 to\n$192.33.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis for Prologis on a Standalone Basis and Pro\nForma\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of\nPrologis common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of\nPrologis common stock, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction.\n80 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Prologis common\nstock as of December 31 of each of 2022 through 2025, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving\neffect to the transaction, by applying price to next twelve months\u2019 AFFO multiples ranging from 30.0x to 36.0x\nto estimates of the AFFO per share of Prologis for each of fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, as reflected in the\nForecasts. By applying a discount rate of 7.6%, reflecting an estimate of Prologis\u2019s cost of equity, Goldman\nSachs discounted to present value, as of March 31, 2022, and summed, both the theoretical future values per\nshare of Prologis common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid\nper share of Prologis common stock through the end of the applicable year, in each case, both on a\nstandalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, as reflected in the Forecasts, to yield\nillustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock on a standalone basis. As set forth in the\nJune 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis\ncommon stock of $123.54 to $167.24, and a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common\nstock pro forma giving effect to the transaction of $127.06 to $173.43. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this\nanalysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock of $122.77 to\n$176.14, and a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock pro forma giving effect\nto the transaction of $126.29 to $182.33.\nThe illustrative price to next twelve months\u2019 AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by\nGoldman Sachs using its professional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated\nby Goldman Sachs as set forth above under \u201c- Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.\u201d Goldman\nSachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the CAPM, which requires\ncertain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Prologis, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all\nof its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,\nGoldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above\nanalyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Prologis or Duke Realty or the transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 provision of its opinion to the\nPrologis board as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of Prologis common stock of\nthe exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do\nthey necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based\nupon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are\ninherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the\nparties or their respective advisors, none of Prologis, Duke Realty, Goldman Sachs or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe exchange ratio was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Prologis and Duke Realty\nand was approved by the Prologis board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Prologis during these\nnegotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Prologis or the\nPrologis board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the\ntransaction.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Prologis board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Prologis board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.\nThe foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nwritten opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\n81 \n",

Morgan Stanley has been advised by the managements of Duke Realty and Prologis,\nrespectively, that each of Duke Realty and Prologis, respectively, has been organized and operated in\nconformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856\nof the Code since its formation, and Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers will not adversely affect the\nstatus of either Duke Realty or Prologis as a REIT (in the case of Duke Realty, through its final taxable year\nthat will end with the company merger). Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan\nStanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Duke\nRealty and Prologis and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.\nMorgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of Duke Realty, or any class of such persons, relative\nto the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock in the transaction\n(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits\nof the mergers as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or\nnot such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent\nvaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Duke Realty or Prologis, nor was Morgan Stanley\nfurnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on\nfinancial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to\nMorgan Stanley as of June 11, 2022. Events occurring after June 11, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to\nupdate, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection\nwith its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Duke Realty board of directors\ndated June 11, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed\nand factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. The various analyses\nsummarized below were based on the closing prices for shares of Duke Realty common stock and shares of\nPrologis common stock as of May 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to Prologis\u2019 public announcement of its\noffer to acquire Duke Realty, and are not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Some of\n84 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthese summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The\nanalyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of\nsuch analyses and of the factors reviewed without considering all analyses and factors could create a\nmisleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Furthermore,\nmathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing the data referred to below.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized\nand relied upon the Financial Projections.

Consequently, the analyses, as\ndescribed above, should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Duke Realty board of directors\nwith respect to the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Duke Realty board of\ndirectors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any\nholder of shares of Duke Realty common stock or shares of Prologis common stock as to how to vote or act\non any matter with respect to the mergers or related transactions or any other action with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did\nnot address any other aspect of the mergers or related transactions, including the relative merits of the\nmergers as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the prices at which\nshares of Duke Realty common stock or shares of Prologis common stock would trade at any time, or any\ncompensation or compensation agreements arising from (or relating to) the mergers which benefit any officer,\ndirector or employee of Duke Realty, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock in the transaction.\nThe Duke Realty board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexperience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,\ninvestment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in\nsecurities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, and prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory\nservices. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or\nmanage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise\nstructure and effect transactions, for their own account or for the accounts of their customers, in debt or\nequity securities or loans of Duke Realty, Prologis, or any other company, or any currency or commodity,\nthat may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any related derivative\ninstrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Duke Realty board of directors with\nfinancial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the mergers, described in this section\nand attached to this statement as Annex C, and Duke Realty agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of\napproximately $96 million for its services, $10 million of which was payable upon the rendering of its opinion,\nand the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the mergers. Duke Realty has\nalso agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses, including reasonable fees of outside\ncounsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Duke\nRealty has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents\nand employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against\ncertain liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial\nadvisory and financing services to Duke Realty and have received approximately $5 million to $10 million in\nconnection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates have provided financing services to Prologis and have received approximately $1 million to $5\nmillion in connection with such services. As of the date of the opinion, affiliates of Morgan Stanley are\nlenders to each of Duke Realty and Prologis under their respective credit facilities. Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates may seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Duke Realty and Prologis and their\nrespective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nCertain Prologis Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nAlthough Prologis periodically may issue limited financial guidance to investors, Prologis does not as a\nmatter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenues, net operating income, funds from\noperations, funds from operations, as adjusted, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty\nof the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Prologis\u2019 management prepared and provided to the\n91 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nPrologis board in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement, and to its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, including in connection with its financial\nanalyses described above under the section entitled \u201c- Opinion of Prologis\u2019 Financial Advisor,\u201d certain\nunaudited prospective financial information as set forth below, which we refer to as the \u201cPrologis\nmanagement forecasts.\u201d In preparing the Prologis management forecasts, Prologis\u2019 management considered\ninformation communicated by Duke Realty and certain synergies and other changes that Prologis\u2019\nmanagement projected to result from the mergers. The below summary of the Prologis management forecasts\nis included for the purpose of providing Prologis stockholders access to certain non-public information that\nwas furnished to the Prologis board, Goldman Sachs and Duke Realty in connection with the mergers and\nsuch information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence the voting\ndecision of any Prologis stockholder or Duke Realty shareholder.\nThe Prologis management forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the preparation and presentation of financial\nprojections. The inclusion of the Prologis management forecasts should not be regarded as an indication\nthat such information is predictive of actual future events or results and such information should not be\nrelied upon as such, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on the Prologis management forecasts. The Prologis management forecasts included in this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Prologis\u2019 management.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information set forth below\nwas based on numerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance\nand general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Prologis\u2019\nbusiness, Duke Realty\u2019s business and the business of the Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving\neffect to the mergers, including anticipated or possible synergies) that are inherently subjective and\nuncertain and are beyond the control of Prologis\u2019 management. Important factors that may affect actual\nresults and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved include, but are not\nlimited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Prologis\u2019 business, Duke Realty\u2019s business and the business of\nthe Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers (including its ability to achieve\nstrategic goals, objectives and targets and to achieve operating synergies over applicable periods), industry\nperformance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the sections entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d This unaudited\nprospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at\nthe time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual\nresults may differ materially from those contained in this unaudited prospective financial information.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Prologis\nstockholders and Duke Realty shareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of both Prologis\nand Duke Realty for descriptions of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial\ncondition and capital resources, including in (i) \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\u201d in Prologis\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which are incorporated\nby reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Duke Realty\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which\nare incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nNone of Prologis, Duke Realty or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this unaudited\nprospective financial information.\nPROLOGIS UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE\nBELOW UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES\nEXISTING AFTER THE DATE THIS UNAUDITED PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS\nGENERATED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY\nOR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR.\nSINCE THE UNAUDITED\n92 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION COVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS\nNATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE YEAR.\nPrologis and Duke Realty may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including AFFO, Excluding\nGains and Promotes and Unlevered Free Cash Flow using different methodologies. Consequently, the\nfinancial metrics presented in each company\u2019s prospective financial information disclosures and in the\nsections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the opinions of Prologis\u2019 financial advisor\nto Prologis and Duke Realty\u2019s financial advisor to Duke Realty may not be directly comparable to one\nanother. Further, these financial metrics are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d as set forth in Item 10(e) of\nRegulation S-K and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with\nGAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures or as an indication of Prologis\u2019, Duke Realty\u2019s or the\nCombined Company\u2019s performance. None of these non-GAAP measures represents cash generated from\noperating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and none are a measure of liquidity or an indicator\nof Prologis\u2019, Duke Realty\u2019s or the Combined Company\u2019s ability to make cash distributions. The below\nunaudited prospective financial information should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation\nof a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the below unaudited prospective financial\ninformation ) in connection with a proposed transaction like the mergers when the disclosure is included in a\ndocument like this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or\nby the Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the mergers. Accordingly, Prologis has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nPrologis has not made and makes no representation to Duke Realty or any Prologis stockholder or Duke\nRealty shareholder, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the below unaudited prospective\nfinancial information or regarding the ultimate performance of Prologis, Duke Realty or the Combined\nCompany on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers compared to the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation or that the projected results will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the\nuncertainties inherent in the unaudited prospective financial information, Prologis urges all Prologis\nstockholders and Duke Realty shareholders not to place undue reliance on such information and to review\nPrologis\u2019 most recent SEC filings for a description of Prologis\u2019 reported financial results.\nNeither KPMG LLP nor any other registered public accounting firm has compiled, examined or performed any\naudit or other procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information contained herein,\nnor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.\nThe report of KPMG LLP contained in Prologis\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus, relates to the\nhistorical financial information of Prologis. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial\ninformation and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information\ndoes not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the dates on which it was prepared.\nThe Prologis management forecasts were provided to the Prologis board and Prologis\u2019 financial advisor,\nGoldman Sachs, and standalone forecasts (other than unlevered free cash flow) were provided to Duke\nRealty.\nPrologis on a Standalone Basis\nThe following table presents a summary of the Prologis management forecasts relating to Prologis (on a\nstandalone basis) for the calendar years 2022 through 2026.\n93 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nYear Ending December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nTotal Net Operating Income\n$4,835\n$5,534\n$5,512\n$6,142\n$ 6,915\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes\n$2,899\n$3,259\n$3,704\n$ 4,118\n$ 4,630\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes/Share\n$ 3.78\n$ 4.24\n$ 4.81\n$ 5.34\n$ 5.99\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n$ 477\n$2,018\n$1,490\n$1,790\n$ 2,419\nDividend/Share\n$ 3.16\n$ 3.54\n$ 3.96\n$ 4.44\n$ 4.97\nAFFO, Excluding Gains and Promotes as used by Prologis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated\nbeginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and modified to: (i)\nexclude net promote income, real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, net gains or\nlosses on real estate transactions (e.g., development properties, land, and other investments in real\nestate), current income tax expense on dispositions, net unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains\nor losses, deferred income tax expense, current income tax expense on dispositions related to acquired\ntax liabilities, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, straight-lined rents and amortization\nof lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs, and management contracts (net),\nstock compensation amortization expense, preferred stock repurchases, (ii) include property\nimprovements and turnover costs, and (iii) incorporate reconciling items related to noncontrolling\ninterests and Prologis\u2019 share of unconsolidated ventures.\nBased on projected weighted average diluted outstanding shares of stock.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow as used by Prologis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated beginning with\nconsolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and modified to: (i) exclude interest\nexpense, preferred stock dividends, distributions with respect to Prologis OP preferred units,\ndepreciation and amortization expense, net gains or losses on real estate transactions (e.g., development\nproperties, land, and other investments in real estate), net unrealized foreign currency and derivative\ngains or losses, deferred income tax expense, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt,\nstraight-lined rents and amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs,\nand management contracts (net), other various non-cash items (ii) include property improvements and\nturnover costs, net deployment cash flows related to acquisitions, dispositions and development\nactivity, promote cash receipts that are not included in consolidated net earnings, and (iii) incorporate\nreconciling items related to noncontrolling interests and Prologis\u2019 share of unconsolidated ventures.\nDuke Realty on a Standalone Basis\nThe following table presents a summary of the Prologis management forecasts relating to Duke Realty (on a\nstandalone basis) for the calendar years 2022 through 2026.

The adjustments include gains or losses on\ndebt transactions, gains or losses from involuntary conversion from weather events or natural disasters,\npromote income, severance and other charges related to major overhead restructuring activities, the\nexpense impact of non-incremental costs attributable to successful leasing activities, mark-to-market\nadjustments associated with derivative financial instruments and similar adjustments for unconsolidated\njoint ventures and partially owned consolidated entities. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure\ncomputed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (\u201cNareit\u201d). It is calculated as net income attributable to common shareholders\ncomputed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate,\ngains and losses on sales of real estate assets (including real estate assets incidental to our business),\ngains and losses from change in control, impairment charges related to real estate assets (including real\nestate assets incidental to our business) and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and\npartially owned consolidated entities, all net of related taxes.

The Duke Realty board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement\nand the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the company merger), and in\nrecommending to Duke Realty shareholders that the merger agreement be approved. Such interests are\ndescribed below. The company merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the executive\ncompensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.\nDuke Realty\u2019s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are\nJames B. Connor (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Mark A. Denien (Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer), Steven W. Schnur (Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer), Nicholas C.\nAnthony (Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer), and Ann C.

Under the terms of each Severance Agreement, in the event that the\n100 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecutive\u2019s employment with Duke Realty is terminated within one year following a change in control of\nDuke Realty (1) by Duke Realty without \u201ccause\u201d or (2) by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (each term as\ndefined in the Severance Agreements), then the executive will be entitled to receive separation payments\ntotaling an amount equal to three times the sum of (i) the executive\u2019s annual base salary then in effect and (ii)\nthe average annual incentive bonus paid or payable to the executive with respect to services performed in\nthe three prior calendar years, payable in equal monthly installments over a 24-month period following the\nexecutive\u2019s termination of employment. The company merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d of Duke\nRealty for purposes of the Severance Agreements.\nIn addition, each of Duke Realty\u2019s executive officers will be entitled to receive a healthcare stipend and a\nfinancial advisory stipend during the 24-month severance period. The healthcare stipend is equal to the\ndifference between (a) the cost the executive would have to pay to continue participation in Duke Realty\u2019s\ngroup medical, dental, vison and/or prescription drug benefits for the executive and his or her eligible\ndependents under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\u201cCOBRA\u201d) for a period of\n36 months and (b) the active associate rate for such coverage, calculated using the monthly COBRA cost\nand active employee rate on the date of the executive\u2019s termination of employment. The healthcare stipend\nwill be reduced by 50% for months during the severance period in which the executive would be age 65 or\nover. The financial advisory stipend is equal to the cost Duke Realty would have to pay to provide the\nexecutive the financial advisory services it provides generally to executive officers for a period of 36 months,\ncalculated using the annual cost for such services in the year in which the executive\u2019s termination date\noccurs.\nThe Severance Agreements provide that if the payments or benefits that the executive is entitled to under\nthe Severance Agreement or any other agreement with Duke Realty would, if paid, be subject to the excise tax\nimposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such payments or benefits will be reduced to the extent\nnecessary to avoid triggering the excise tax, unless the executive would have a more favorable tax result by\nreceiving the unreduced payments and paying the excise tax.\nThe severance payments and stipends described above are conditioned upon the executive\u2019s execution and\nnon-revocation of a general release of claims. In addition, the executive\u2019s right to receive such severance\npayments and stipends would cease if he or she violates any of the post-employment restrictive covenants\nin the Severance Agreements, which include non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure\nobligations. The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants generally last for two years following the\nexecutive\u2019s termination of employment.\nSee the section entitled \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty\u2019s Named\nExecutive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d beginning on page 102 of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus for the estimated severance amounts that each of Duke Realty\u2019s named executive\nofficers would receive under his or her Severance Agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment\nfollowing a change in control of Duke Realty.\nTreatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses\nEither shortly before, or promptly following, the closing date, each employee of Duke Realty, including each\nexecutive officer, who is eligible to receive a 2022 annual cash incentive payment (a \u201c2022 Bonus\u201d) will\nreceive payment of such employee\u2019s full 2022 Bonus amount. Each 2022 Bonus amount will be calculated\nbased on the combination of (i) the actual level of achievement of the applicable pre-established Duke Realty\nperformance goals through the latest practicable date prior to the closing date, (ii) assuming that the level of\nachievement of such pre-established goals for the remainder of 2022 is at the projected level, and (iii)\nassuming the target level of performance for any individual performance goals.\nSee the section entitled \u201c- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty\u2019s Named\nExecutive Officers in Connection with the Mergers\u201d beginning on page 102 of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus for the estimated bonus payment amount that each of Duke Realty\u2019s named executive\nofficers would receive in connection with the company merger.\n280G-Related Further Actions\nPrior to the closing date, the Duke Realty board (or the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the\nDuke Realty board) is expected to adopt a gross-up plan pursuant to which certain senior executives\n101 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nof Duke Realty, including Duke Realty\u2019s named executive officers, will be eligible to receive a \u201cgross-up\u201d in\nrespect of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code in relation to the executive\u2019s change in\ncontrol payments and benefits relating to the mergers, which would put the executive in the same after-tax\nposition that the executive would have been in had the excise tax not applied. The maximum aggregate\namount of the gross-up payments that may be payable under such gross-up plan will be $30 million. To the\nextent that the aggregate gross-up payments otherwise due under such gross-up plan would exceed such\naggregate cap, each executive\u2019s gross-up payment will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate\namount of all gross-up payments does not exceed the aggregate cap.\nTermination and Liquidation of Certain Deferred Compensation Plans and Arrangements\nPrior to the closing date, the Duke Realty board (or a committee thereof), is expected to terminate, effective\nas of the company merger effective time, certain of Duke Realty\u2019s deferred compensation plans and\narrangements, including its Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan, its Executives\u2019 Deferred Compensation\nPlan and all outstanding Duke Realty RSU awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation under\nSection 409A of the Code. All outstanding deferred compensation amounts under such terminated deferred\ncompensation plans and arrangements will be paid to the applicable participants within ten business days\nfollowing the company merger effective time. Each of Messrs. Schnur and Anthony, and Ms. Dee, have\noutstanding, vested deferred Duke Realty RSU awards and/or deferred cash amounts under Duke Realty\u2019s\nExecutives\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition, certain of the current and former non-employee\nmembers of the Duke Realty board have outstanding deferred shares and/or deferred cash amounts under\nDuke Realty\u2019s Directors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan.\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Prologis\nAny Duke Realty executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to\nprovide services to Prologis or the surviving entity may, prior to, on or following the company merger\neffective time, enter into new individualized compensation arrangements with Prologis or the surviving entity\nand may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Prologis or the surviving\nentity. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation\narrangements between Duke Realty\u2019s executive officers and Prologis or the surviving entity have been\nestablished.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Duke Realty non-employee directors and executive officers\nwill be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies following the mergers. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described\nin the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance\u201d\nbeginning on page 130 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nDuke Realty Chairman and CEO Appointment to Prologis Board\nAt the company merger effective time, Mr. Connor is expected to be added to the Prologis board to serve,\ntogether with the then members of the Prologis board, until the next annual meeting of shareholders of\nPrologis. In connection with such next annual meeting of shareholders of Prologis, the Board Governance\nand Nomination Committee of the Prologis board intends to recommend to the Prologis board that it\nrecommend the nomination of Mr. Connor for re-election to the Prologis board at such annual meeting of\nshareholders, provided that at such time Mr. Connor satisfies the qualifications to serve on the Prologis\nboard.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with\nMergers\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-\nK, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of Duke Realty\u2019s named\nexecutive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the mergers.

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Prologis\nreceives a written opinion from Wachtell Lipton (or other counsel as may be reasonably acceptable to Duke\nRealty and Prologis) to the effect that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning\nof Section 368(a) of the Code. Hogan Lovells and Wachtell Lipton are providing opinions to Duke Realty and\nPrologis, respectively, to the same effect in connection with the filing of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Such opinions will be subject to customary exceptions, assumptions and\nqualifications, and will be based on representations made by Duke Realty and Prologis regarding factual\nmatters (including those contained in the tax representation letters provided by Duke Realty and Prologis),\nand covenants undertaken by Duke Realty and Prologis. If any assumption or representation is inaccurate in\nany way, or any covenant is not complied with, the tax consequences of the company merger could differ\nfrom those described in the tax opinions and in this summary. These tax opinions represent the legal\njudgment of counsel rendering the opinion and are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If the condition\nrelating to either tax opinion to be delivered at closing is waived, this joint proxy statement/prospectus will\nbe amended and recirculated.\n106 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProvided the company merger is treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,\nthe United States federal income tax consequences of the company merger will be as follows:\nDuke Realty will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the company merger.\nA United States holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock will not recognize any gain or loss\nupon receipt of the shares of Combined Company common stock in exchange for its shares of Duke\nRealty common stock in connection with the company merger, except with respect to cash received in\nlieu of any fractional share of the Combined Company common stock, as discussed below.\nA United States holder will have an aggregate tax basis in the shares of Combined Company common\nstock it receives in the company merger equal to the United States holder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in its\nshares of Duke Realty common stock surrendered pursuant to the company merger (including any\nfractional shares deemed received and exchange for cash, as discussed below).\nThe holding period of the shares of Combined Company common stock received by a United States\nholder in connection with the company merger will include the holding period of the shares of Duke\nRealty common stock surrendered in connection with the company merger.\nIf a United States holder acquired any of its shares of Duke Realty common stock prior to the\ncompany merger at different prices and/or at different times, U.S. Treasury regulations provide that\nthe tax basis and holding period of each block of shares of Combined Company common stock\nreceived by such United States holder in the company merger will be determined on a block-for-block\nbasis depending on the basis and holding period of the blocks of shares of Duke Realty common\nstock exchanged for shares of Combined Company common stock. United States holders that\nacquired different blocks of shares of Duke Realty common stock at different times or at different\nprices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis and holding period of\nsuch shares of Duke Realty common stock to particular shares of Combined Company common stock\nreceived in the company merger.\nCash received by a United States holder in lieu of a fractional share of the Combined Company\ncommon stock in the company merger will be treated as if such fractional share had been issued in\nconnection with the company merger and then redeemed by the Combined Company for cash, and\nsuch United States holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to such cash\npayment, measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the United\nStates holder\u2019s tax basis in such fractional share. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if, at the company merger effective time, the United States holder\u2019s holding period in\nrespect of such fractional share (as described above) is greater than one year. Non-corporate United\nStates stockholders are generally subject to tax on long-term capital gains at reduced rates under\ncurrent law. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, information reporting requirements will apply to any cash received in the company merger. Certain\nholders of shares of Duke Realty common stock may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of\n24%) with respect to any cash received in the company merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply,\nhowever, to a holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9, or is otherwise exempt\nfrom backup withholding and provides appropriate proof of the applicable exemption. Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and any amounts withheld will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder\u2019s\nUnited States federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required\ninformation to the IRS.\nTax Opinions from Counsel Regarding REIT Qualification of Duke Realty and Prologis\nIt is a condition to the obligation of Prologis to complete the mergers that Prologis receive a written tax\nopinion from Alston & Bird LLP (or such other nationally recognized REIT counsel as may be reasonably\nacceptable to Prologis and Duke Realty) to the effect that, beginning with its taxable year ended December\n31, 1999 and ending at the moment in time immediately prior to the company merger effective time, Duke\nRealty has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and\n107 \n",

The opinion of Alston & Bird LLP (or such other counsel) will be subject\nto customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications, and be based on representations made by Duke\nRealty regarding factual matters (including those contained in tax representation letters provided by Duke\nRealty) relating to the organization and operation of Duke Realty and its subsidiaries.\nIt is a condition to the obligation of Duke Realty to complete the mergers that Duke Realty receive an opinion\nfrom Mayer Brown LLP (or such other nationally recognized REIT counsel reasonably acceptable to Duke\nRealty and Prologis) to the effect that beginning with Prologis\u2019 taxable year ended December 31, 1997 and\nthrough the closing date, Prologis has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for\nqualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and Prologis\u2019 proposed method of organization and\noperations will enable Prologis to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a\nREIT under the Code. The opinion of Mayer Brown LLP (or such other counsel) will be subject to customary\nexceptions, assumptions and qualifications, and be based on representations made by Prologis and Duke\nRealty regarding factual matters (including those contained in tax representation letters provided by Prologis\nand Duke Realty), and covenants undertaken by Prologis, relating to the organization and operation of\nPrologis, Duke Realty, the Combined Company and their subsidiaries.\nNeither of the opinions described above will be binding on the IRS or the courts. The Combined Company\nintends to continue to operate in a manner to qualify as a REIT following the company merger, but there is no\nguarantee that it will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon\nthe ability of the Combined Company to meet, through actual annual (or, in some cases, quarterly) operating\nresults, requirements relating to income, asset ownership, distribution levels and diversity of share\nownership, and the various REIT qualification requirements imposed under the Code. Given the complex\nnature of the REIT qualification requirements, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the\npossibility of future changes in the circumstances of the Combined Company, there can be no assurance that\nthe actual operating results of the Combined Company will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT\nunder the Code for any particular taxable year.\nTax Liabilities and Attributes Inherited from Duke Realty\nIf Duke Realty failed to qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years for which the applicable period for\nassessment had not expired, Duke Realty would be liable for (and the Combined Company would be\nobligated to pay) United States federal income tax on its taxable income for such years at regular corporate\nrates, and, assuming the company merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)\nof the Code, the Combined Company must distribute any earnings and profits of Duke Realty by the close of\nthe taxable year in which the company merger occurs and would be subject to tax on the built-in gain on each\nDuke Realty asset existing at the time of the company merger if the Combined Company were to dispose of\nthe Duke Realty asset in a taxable transaction during the five-year period following the company merger.\nSuch tax would be imposed at the highest regular corporate rate in effect as of the date of the sale. Moreover,\neven if Duke Realty qualified as a REIT at all relevant times, the Combined Company similarly would be liable\nfor other unpaid taxes (if any) of Duke Realty (such as the 100% tax on gains from any sales treated as\n\u201cprohibited transactions\u201d). Furthermore, after the company merger the asset and gross income tests\napplicable to REITs will apply to all of the assets of the Combined Company, including the assets the\nCombined Company acquires from Duke Realty, and to all of the gross income of the Combined Company,\nincluding the income derived from the assets the Combined Company acquires from Duke Realty. As a result,\nthe nature of the assets that the Combined Company acquires from Duke Realty and the gross income the\nCombined Company derives from such assets will be taken into account in determining the qualification of\nthe Combined Company as a REIT.\nQualification as a REIT requires Duke Realty to satisfy numerous requirements, some on an annual and\nothers on a quarterly basis. There are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations of these\nrequirements, and qualification as a REIT involves the determination of various factual matters and\ncircumstances that are not entirely within the control of Duke Realty.\nAccounting Treatment\nPrologis prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The mergers will be accounted for by\nusing the business combination accounting rules, which requires the application of a screen test to evaluate\n108 ",

If during the notice period, any material revisions are made to the superior\nproposal (including any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such superior proposal),\nthe Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, must give notice to the other party regarding\nsuch revisions prior to the expiration of the notice period and the notice period will thereafter expire on the\nthird business day immediately following the date of the delivery of such notice (but in no event will delivery\nof a such notice regarding revisions shorten the four business day duration applicable to the initial notice\nperiod).

In the event that the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable,\ndoes not make such a change in Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as\napplicable, following such intervening event notice period, but thereafter determines to make such a change\nin Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as applicable, in circumstances not\ninvolving an acquisition proposal, the foregoing procedures and requirements will apply anew prior to the\ntaking of any such actions.\nFor purposes of the merger agreement and with respect to an acquisition proposal, \u201csuperior proposal\u201d\nmeans a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (except that, for purposes of the definition of\n\u201csuperior proposal,\u201d the references in the definition of \u201cacquisition proposal\u201d to \u201c15%\u201d are deemed replaced\nby \u201c50%\u201d) made by a third party on terms that the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable,\n128 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into\naccount all factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Prologis board or the Duke Realty\nboard, as applicable, including, to the extent deemed relevant by the Prologis board or the Duke Realty\nboard, as applicable, financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the transactions, including the\nidentity of the person or entity making such proposal, any termination fees, expense reimbursement\nprovisions, conditions to consummation and whether the transactions contemplated by such acquisition\nproposal are reasonably capable of being consummated) would be more favorable to Prologis and the\nholders of shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty and the holders of shares of Duke Realty\ncommon stock, as applicable, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For purposes of\nthe merger agreement, \u201cintervening event\u201d means a material fact, effect, event, change, development,\ncircumstance, condition or occurrence that has occurred or arisen after the date of the merger agreement, that\nwas not known to the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable (or, if known, the consequences\nof which were not reasonably foreseeable to the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, as of\nthe date of the merger agreement) and materially affects the business, assets or operations of Prologis and\nits subsidiaries, or of Duke Realty and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable.

Prologis is also required to\npromptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the indemnified parties, to the fullest extent that an Indiana\ncorporation is permitted to indemnify and hold harmless its own such persons or entities under the\napplicable laws of the State of Indiana, as now or hereafter in effect, any claim expenses incurred in\ndefending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any claim in\nadvance of the final disposition of such claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the\nindemnified party of any claim expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with enforcing\nany rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of\nany bond or other security, but subject to Prologis\u2019 receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such\nindemnified party to repay such claim expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable laws or any of\nthe Duke Realty governing documents that such indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified.\nPrior to the company merger effective time, Duke Realty is required to obtain and fully pay the premium for,\nand Prologis is required to maintain in full force and effect (and the obligations thereunder to be honored),\nduring the six-year period beginning on the date of the company merger, a

250% of the current annual premium paid by Duke Realty for such insurance, and (ii) if the aggregate\npremium exceeds 250%, Duke Realty will be entitled to obtain comparable \u201ctail\u201d insurance as reasonably\navailable for an aggregate cost equal to 250% of the current annual premium.\nEfforts to Complete Transactions\u037e Consents\nEach of the Duke Realty parties and the Prologis parties

Under the MGCL, the term \u201csubstantially all of the company\u2019s assets\u201d\nis not defined and is, therefore, subject to Maryland common law and to judicial interpretation and review in\nthe context of the unique facts and circumstances of any particular transaction. Prologis\u2019 charter does not\nprovide for a lesser percentage in any of the above situations.\nLiquidation Preference\nUnder the MGCL, stockholders are generally not liable for Prologis\u2019 debts or obligations. If Prologis\nliquidates, subject to the right of any holders of its preferred stock to receive preferential distributions, each\noutstanding share of Prologis common stock will be entitled to participate pro rata in the assets remaining\nafter payment of, or adequate provision for, all of its known debts and liabilities, including debts and\nliabilities arising out of Prologis\u2019 status as general partner of Prologis OP.\nSubject to the provisions of Prologis\u2019 charter regarding the ownership of shares of common stock in excess\nof the ownership limit, or such other limit specified in its charter, or as otherwise permitted by the Prologis\nboard as described below, all shares of common stock have equal distribution, liquidation and voting rights,\nand have no preference or exchange rights.\nConversion & Sinking Fund\nHolders of shares of Prologis common stock do not have any conversion, exchange, sinking fund, or\nredemption rights.\nListing\nThe common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cPLD.\u201d Following completion of the company\nmerger, the shares of common stock of the Combined Company will continue to be traded on the NYSE under\nthe symbol \u201cPLD.\u201d\nClassification of Common Stock\nPrologis\u2019 charter authorizes the Prologis board to reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into other\nclasses or series of classes of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set\nthe preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations and restrictions on\nownership, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of\nredemption for each class or series.\nTransfer Agent\nAll shares of Prologis common stock that are issued and outstanding are duly authorized, fully paid and\nnonassessable. The transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent for Prologis common stock is\ncurrently Computershare Trust Company, N.A.\nRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer\nIn order for Prologis to qualify as a REIT under the Code, no more than 50% in value of all classes of its\noutstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as\ndefined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year\nfor which Prologis has made an election to be treated as a REIT). In addition, if Prologis, or an owner of 10%\nor more of its capital stock, actually or constructively own 10% or more of one of its tenants (or a tenant of\nany partnership or limited liability company in which Prologis is a partner or member), the rent received by\nPrologis (either directly or through the partnership or limited liability company) from the tenant will not be\nqualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests for REITs contained in the Code. A REIT\u2019s stock\nalso must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a\n149 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntaxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for\nwhich an election to be treated as a REIT has been made).\nBecause the Prologis board believes it is desirable for Prologis to qualify as a REIT, its charter, subject to\ncertain exceptions as discussed below, provides that no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of\nthe constructive ownership provisions of the Code, (i) more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares,\nwhichever is more restrictive) of its issued and outstanding common stock or (ii) series Q preferred stock,\nthat, together with all other capital stock owned or deemed owned by such person, would cause such person\nto own or be deemed to own more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of\nits issued and outstanding capital stock. Further, subject to certain exceptions, no person, or persons acting\nas a group, shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25% of the series Q\npreferred stock. With respect to the 9.8% ownership limit, the constructive ownership rules under the Code\nare complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or\nentities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8%\nof Prologis common stock, any series of outstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock (or the\nacquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, common stock, any series of\noutstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock) by an individual or entity could nevertheless cause\nthat individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of its\noutstanding common stock or any other capital stock, as the case may be, and thereby subject the common\nstock, any series of outstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock to the applicable ownership limit.\nThe Prologis board may, but in no event will be required to, waive the 9.8% and 25% ownership limits, as\napplicable, with respect to a particular stockholder if it determines that such ownership will not jeopardize\nPrologis\u2019 status as a REIT and the Prologis board otherwise decides such action would be in its best interest.\nAs a condition of such waiver, the Prologis board may require an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it and/or\nundertakings or representations from the applicant with respect to preserving Prologis\u2019 REIT status.\nPrologis\u2019 charter also provides that:\nno person may actually or constructively own common stock or series Q preferred stock that would\nresult in Prologis being \u201cclosely held\u201d under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause Prologis\nto fail to qualify as a REIT\u037e\nno person may transfer common stock or series Q preferred stock if a transfer would result in shares\nof Prologis\u2019 capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons\u037e and\nany person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire actual or constructive ownership of\ncommon stock or series Q preferred stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on\ntransferability and ownership is required to notify Prologis immediately and provide Prologis with\nsuch other information as Prologis may request in order to determine the effect of the transfer on\nPrologis\u2019 status as a REIT.\nThese restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the Prologis board determines that it is\nno longer in Prologis\u2019 best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT and such\ndetermination is approved by the affirmative vote of holders owning at least two-thirds of the shares of\nPrologis\u2019 outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon. Except as otherwise described above, any\nchange in the applicable ownership limit would require an amendment to Prologis\u2019 charter, which must be\ndeclared advisable by the Prologis board and approved by the affirmative vote of holders owning at least\ntwo-thirds of the shares of Prologis\u2019 outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the amendment.\nUnder Prologis\u2019 charter, if any attempted transfer of shares of stock or any other event would otherwise\nresult in any person violating an ownership limit, any other limit imposed by the Prologis board or the other\nrestrictions in the charter, then any such attempted transfer will be void and of no force or effect with respect\nto the purported transferee as to that number of shares that exceeds the applicable ownership limit or such\nother limit or restriction, which we refer to as \u201cexcess shares.\u201d Under those circumstances, the prohibited\ntransferee will acquire no right or interest (or, in the case of any event other than an attempted transfer, the\nperson or entity holding record title to any shares in excess of the applicable ownership limit will cease to\nown any right or interest) in the excess shares. Any excess shares described above will be transferred\nautomatically, by operation of law, to a trust, the beneficiary of which will be a qualified charitable\n150 \n",

This automatic transfer will be considered to be effective as of the close of\nbusiness on the business day prior to the date of the violating transfer or event. Within 20 days of receiving\nnotice from Prologis of the transfer of shares to such trust, the trustee of such trust will be required to sell\nthe excess shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the applicable ownership\nlimit, or any other limit imposed by the Prologis board, and distribute to the prohibited transferee an amount\nequal to the lesser of the price paid by the prohibited transferee for the excess shares or the sales proceeds\nreceived by such trust for the excess shares. In the case of any excess shares resulting from any event other\nthan a transfer, or from a transfer for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell the\nexcess shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the prohibited owner an amount equal to the\nlesser of the applicable market price of the excess shares as of the date of the event or the sales proceeds\nreceived by such trust for the excess shares. In either case, any proceeds in excess of the amount\ndistributable to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner will be distributed to the beneficiary. Prior to a\nsale of any excess shares by such trust, the trustee will be entitled to receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all\ndividends and other distributions paid by Prologis with respect to the excess shares, and also will be entitled\nto exercise all voting rights with respect to the excess shares. Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the\ndate that the shares have been transferred to such trust, the trustee will have the authority (at the trustee\u2019s\nsole discretion) to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited transferee or prohibited owner prior to the\ntime that Prologis discovers that the shares have been automatically transferred to such trust and to recast\nthe vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if\nPrologis has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to\nrescind and recast the vote. If Prologis pays the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner any dividend or\nother distribution before it discovers that the shares were transferred to such trust, the prohibited transferee\nor prohibited owner will be required to repay the trustee upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary. If\nthe transfer to such trust is not automatically effective (for any reason), to prevent violation of the\napplicable ownership limit or any other limit provided in Prologis\u2019 charter or imposed by the Prologis board,\nthen Prologis\u2019 charter provides that the transfer of the excess shares will be void ab initio and the intended\ntransferee will acquire no rights to such shares.\nIn addition, shares of stock held in such trust will be considered to have been offered for sale to Prologis, or\nits designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted\nin the transfer to such trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or\ngift), and (ii) the applicable market price on the date that Prologis, or its designee, accept the offer. Prologis\nhas the right to accept the offer until the trustee has sold the shares held in such trust. Upon that sale to\nPrologis, the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net\nproceeds of the sale to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner.\nIf any attempted transfer of shares would cause Prologis to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons,\nits charter provides that the transfer will be void ab initio and the intended transferee will acquire no rights\nto such shares.\nAll certificates representing shares will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.\nUnder Prologis\u2019 charter, owners of its issued and outstanding common stock must, upon its demand, provide\nPrologis with a completed questionnaire containing information regarding ownership of the shares, as set\nforth in the U.S. Treasury regulations, and must upon demand disclose to Prologis in writing such\ninformation that Prologis may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of the stockholder\u2019s actual and\nconstructive ownership of shares of its stock, on its status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with each\nownership limit, or any other limit specified in its charter or required by the Prologis board. In addition,\nowners of any series of outstanding preferred stock (currently only series Q preferred stock is outstanding)\nmust provide to Prologis information that it requests, in good faith, in order to determine its status as a REIT.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in the Prologis Charter and Bylaws\nCertain provisions of the Prologis charter could make it less likely that the Prologis board or management\nwould be changed or someone would acquire voting control of Prologis without the consent of the Prologis\nboard. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent tender offers or takeover attempts that\n151 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPrologis stockholders might believe are in their best interests, including tender offers or takeover attempts\nthat could allow Prologis stockholders to receive premiums over the market price of their common stock.\nPreferred Stock\nAt any time, without stockholder approval, the Prologis board can issue one or more new series of preferred\nstock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock could discourage or make more difficult attempts to\ntake control of Prologis through a merger, tender offer, proxy context or otherwise. Preferred stock with\nspecial voting rights or other features issued to persons favoring Prologis management could stop a\ntakeover by preventing the person trying to take control of Prologis from acquiring enough voting shares to\ntake control.\nStockholders\u2019 Rights Plan\nAlthough Prologis does not have a stockholders\u2019 rights plan as of the date of this document, under\nMaryland law, the Prologis board can adopt a rights plan without stockholder approval. If adopted, a rights\nplan could operate to cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Prologis on\nterms not approved by the Prologis board.\nExtraordinary Actions\nCurrently, the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be\ncast on the matter is required to amend the Prologis charter or approve certain other extraordinary actions,\nsuch as mergers, which could discourage or make more difficult attempts to take control of Prologis through\na merger, tender offer, proxy context or otherwise.\nOpt Out of Business Combinations and Control Share Acquisition Statutes\nPrologis has elected in its bylaws not to be governed by the \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d provisions of the\nMGCL (Sections 3-701 through 3-709), and the Prologis board has determined, by irrevocable resolution, that\nPrologis will not be governed by the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provision of the MGCL (Section 3-602).\nPrologis\u2019 bylaws provide that Prologis cannot at a future date determine to be governed by either provision\nwithout the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote. In addition,\nthe irrevocable resolution adopted by the Prologis board may only be changed by the approval of a majority\nof the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote.\nCertain Elective Provisions of Maryland Law\nAny Maryland corporation that has a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three\nindependent directors may elect to be governed in whole or in part by Maryland law provisions relating to\nextraordinary actions and unsolicited takeovers. Prologis has not elected to be governed by these specific\nprovisions, but Prologis currently has more than three independent directors, so, except as described below,\nthe Prologis board could elect to provide for any of the following provisions. Pursuant to these provisions,\nthe board of directors of any Maryland corporation fitting such description, without obtaining stockholder\napproval and notwithstanding a contrary provision in its charter or bylaws, may elect to:\nclassify the board\u037e\nincrease the required stockholder vote to remove a director to two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be\ncast by the stockholders generally in the election of directors\u037e and/or\nrequire that a stockholder-requested special meeting need be called only upon the written request of\nthe stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nAdditionally, the board could provide that:\nthe number of directors may be fixed only by a vote of the board of directors\u037e\neach vacancy on the board of directors (including a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director\nby the stockholders) may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors\nin office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum\u037e and/or\n152 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nany director elected to fill a vacancy will hold office for the full remainder of the term of the class of\ndirectors in which the vacancy occurred, rather than until the next election of directors.\nThese provisions do not provide for limits on the power of a corporation to confer on the holders of any\nclass or series of preferred stock the right to elect one or more directors. In addition, a corporation\u2019s charter\nmay contain a provision or the board of directors of the corporation may adopt a resolution that prohibits\nthe corporation from electing to be subject to any or all of these provisions. The Prologis board adopted a\nresolution prohibiting Prologis from electing to be subject to the classified board provision in Section 3-803\nof the MGCL. This resolution is irrevocable without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of\ncommon stock entitled to vote.\nAlthough Prologis has opted out of the classified board and is not currently governed by any of the\nremaining provisions, Prologis\u2019 charter and/or bylaws already provide for a two-thirds vote to remove\ndirectors and only for cause, and provide that the number of directors may be determined by a resolution of\nthe Prologis board (or by Prologis\u2019 stockholders through a bylaw amendment), subject to a minimum and\nmaximum number, and that Prologis\u2019 secretary must call a special meeting of stockholders only upon the\nwritten request of stockholders entitled to cast at least 50% of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nAmendment to Prologis\u2019 Charter and Bylaws\nOther than certain amendments permitted to be made without stockholder approval under Maryland law,\nPrologis\u2019 charter may not be amended without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the shares of\ncapital stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment, voting together as a single class.\nExcept as described in the following paragraph, Prologis\u2019 bylaws may be amended by the vote of a majority\nof the Prologis board or by a vote of a majority of the shares of Prologis\u2019 capital stock entitled to vote on the\namendment, except with respect to the following bylaw provisions (each of which requires the approval of a\nmajority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote on the amendment):\nprovisions opting out of the control share acquisition statute\u037e\nprovisions confirming that the Prologis board has determined by irrevocable resolution that Prologis\nwill not be governed by the business combination provisions of the MGCL\u037e\nthe requirement in Prologis\u2019 bylaws that its independent directors approve transactions involving\nPrologis\u2019 executive officers or directors or any limited partners of Prologis OP and their affiliates\u037e\nprovisions governing amendment of Prologis\u2019 bylaws\u037e and\nprovisions requiring written notice of stockholder meetings.\n153 \n",

Control shares do not include\nshares the acquiring person is then\nentitled to vote as a result of having\npreviously obtained stockholder\napproval. Generally, a \u201ccontrol share\nacquisition\u201d means the acquisition of\noutstanding control shares. A\ncontrol share acquisition does not\ninclude shares acquired in a merger,\nconsolidation or share exchange if\nthe corporation is a party to the\ntransaction or to acquisitions\napproved or exempted by the charter\nor bylaws of the corporation. As\npermitted under Maryland law,\nPrologis has elected not to be\ngoverned by the provisions of the\ncontrol share acquisition statute.\nUnder Maryland law, certain\n\u201cbusiness combinations\u201d  (which\ninclude a merger, consolidation,\nshare exchange and certain transfers,\nissuances or reclassifications of\nequity securities) between a\nMaryland corporation and any\nperson who beneficially owns,\ndirectly or indirectly, 10% or more of\nthe voting power of the\ncorporation\u2019s outstanding voting\nstock, or an affiliate or associate of\nthe corporation who beneficially\nowned, directly or indirectly, 10% or\nmore of the voting power at any time\nwithin the preceding two years, in\neach case referred to as an\n\u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d or an\naffiliate thereof, are prohibited for\nfive years after the most recent date\non which the interested stockholder\nbecomes an interested stockholder.\nholding the same class of equity\nsecurities of the target company\non substantially equivalent\nterms. Within 20 business days\nof the statement being filed, a\nhearing is held and if it is found\nthat the statement does not\ncontain the required disclosure\nor the offer is not made to\nofferees on substantially\nequivalent terms, the\ncommissioner can prohibit the\npurchase of shares in the offer\nor condition the purchase on\nchanges or modifications. In\naddition, Indiana law prohibits a\nbidder from acquiring any\nadditional equity securities of\nthe target company for two\nyears after the tender offer\nunless holders of the subject\nequity security are given a\nreasonable opportunity to\ndispose of their holdings to the\nbidder on equivalent terms. The\nIBCL provides that, unless an\nIndiana corporation provides an\nexemption in its articles of\nincorporation or bylaws, any\nperson who makes a \u201ccontrol\nshare acquisition\u201d may not vote\nthe shares acquired in that\nacquisition, except to the extent\nvoting rights relating to those\nshares are granted by a\nresolution approved by a vote of\ndisinterested shareholders. A\n\u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is\ndefined as the acquisition by a\nperson of, or the power to direct\nthe voting of, shares\nrepresenting between 1/5 and\n1/3, between 1/3 and 1/2, or 1/2\nor more of an issuing public\ncorporation\u2019s voting power in\nthe election of directors, either\nwithin a 90-day period or\npursuant to a plan to make a\ncontrol share acquisition of\nownership.

As permitted under\nMaryland law, the Prologis board has\nby resolution opted out of the\nbusiness combination provisions of\nthe MGCL and, consequently, the\nfive-year prohibition and the super-\nmajority vote requirements will not\napply to business combinations\nbetween Prologis and any interested\nstockholder.\nThe Prologis charter provides that\nholders of its stock are not entitled\nto exercise any rights of an objecting\nstockholder provided for under\nMaryland law unless the Prologis\nboard determines that such rights\napply.\nUnder certain provisions of\nMaryland law relating to unsolicited\ntakeovers, a Maryland corporation\nwith a class of equity securities\nregistered under the Exchange Act\nand at least three independent\ndirectors may elect to be subject, by\nprovision in its charter or bylaws or\nby resolutions of its board of\ndirectors and notwithstanding any\ncontrary provision in the charter or\nshareholders\u2019 meeting to restore\nor approve voting rights after\nthe acquiring person delivers to\nthe corporation a statement\ndescribing the acquisition or\nproposed acquisition, which is\nreferred to as an acquiring\nperson statement, and an\nundertaking to pay the expenses\nrelating to the meeting. Shares\nacquired in a control share\nacquisition in which no\nacquiring person statement has\nbeen filed may be redeemed by\nthe corporation at their fair\nvalue, under certain\ncircumstances. Unless otherwise\nprovided in a corporation\u2019s\narticles of incorporation or\nbylaws, if shares acquired in a\ncontrol share acquisition are\ngiven full voting rights and the\nacquiring person has acquired\nshares representing a majority or\nmore of the corporation\u2019s voting\npower, then the other\nshareholders will be entitled to\ndissenters\u2019 rights of appraisal.\nDuke Realty has not opted out\nof this provision.

A copy\nof the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you\nto read the merger agreement carefully.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the company merger, each issued and\noutstanding share of Duke Realty common stock as of immediately prior to the company merger will be\nautomatically converted into the right to receive 0.475 of a newly issued share of Prologis common stock,\nwithout interest, plus the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Prologis common stock\ninto which such shares of Duke Realty common stock would have been converted pursuant to the merger\nagreement. At the effective time of the partnership merger, each issued and outstanding common unit of\nDuke Realty OP as of immediately prior to the partnership merger will be converted into 0.475 of a newly\nissued common unit of Prologis OP. The 0.475 exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect\nchanges in the stock prices of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock prior to closing.\nChanges in the price of Prologis common stock prior to the mergers will affect the market value of the merger\nconsideration that Duke Realty shareholders and Duke Realty OP unitholders will be entitled to receive upon\nthe closing of the mergers. Subject to the approval by the stockholders of Prologis and the shareholders of\nDuke Realty and the other closing conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the mergers\nare expected to be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nBased on current information, it is expected that former Duke Realty shareholders will own approximately\n20% and current Prologis stockholders will own approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding Combined\nCompany common stock after consummation of the mergers. After consideration of all applicable factors\npursuant to the business combination accounting rules, we expect to treat the mergers as an asset\nacquisition under GAAP and as a result the transaction costs will likely be capitalized to the basis of the\nacquired properties.\nPro Forma Information\nThe following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements combine the historical\nconsolidated financial statements of Prologis and Duke Realty, including Pro Forma Balance Sheets and\nStatements of Income, which we refer to as the \u201cPro Forma Financial Statements\u201d.\nThe accompanying Pro Forma Balance Sheets at March 31, 2022 have been prepared as if the mergers had\noccurred as of March 31, 2022. The accompanying Pro Forma Statements of Income for the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared as if the mergers had\noccurred as of January 1, 2021.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, Prologis and Duke Realty acquired and disposed\nof various real estate assets. None of the assets acquired and disposed of by the respective companies\nduring this period, individually or in the aggregate, or acquisitions and dispositions considered probable of\nclosing as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, exceeded the significance level that requires\nthe presentation of pro forma financial information pursuant to Regulation S-X, Article 11. As such, the\nfollowing Pro Forma Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 do not include pro forma adjustments to present the impact of these insignificant\nacquisitions and dispositions as if they occurred on January 1, 2021.\n177 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nPro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are described in the accompanying\nNotes to Pro Forma Financial Statements, which are referred to in this section as the accompanying notes.\nThe pro forma adjustments and the purchase price allocation as presented are based on estimates and certain\ninformation that is currently available. Under acquisition accounting, the total cost or total consideration\nexchanged is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis.\nAll other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we do not intend\nto operate long-term are recorded at fair value. The total consideration and assignment of fair values to Duke\nRealty\u2019s assets and liabilities has not been finalized and is subject to change and the actual amounts at the\ntime the mergers are completed could vary materially from the Pro Forma Financial Statements.\nThe Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the\nSEC. All significant adjustments that can be factually supported, are directly attributable to the mergers and\nare expected to have a continuing impact within the SEC regulations covering the preparation of the Pro\nForma Financial Statements, have been made. The Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented for\nillustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the combined operating results or financial\nposition that would have occurred if such transactions had been consummated on the dates and in\naccordance with the assumptions described herein, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating\nresults or financial position. We expect that the mergers will create significant corporate general and\nadministrative as well as property operating cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in achieving these anticipated cost savings. Therefore, the Pro Forma Financial Statements\nincluded herein do not give effect to any synergies, potential cost reductions or other operating efficiencies\nthat we expect to result from the mergers based on management\u2019s plans or intent after the mergers.\n(1) \n(2) \nthat we expect to result from the mergers based on management\u2019s plans or intent after the mergers.\nYou are urged to read the Pro Forma Financial Statements below together with Prologis\u2019 and Duke Realty\u2019s\npublicly available historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nMerger Consideration\nFor purposes of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, Prologis estimates that the mergers will be completed\nfor $25.4 billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of Prologis common stock and units\nissued of $21.8 billion, the assumption of debt of $3.3 billion and transaction costs. The aggregate equity\nconsideration consists of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units issued in\nexchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock and Duke Realty OP common units and is calculated as\nfollows (in millions, except price per share/unit):\nNumber of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units to be\nissued upon conversion of shares of Duke Realty common stock and Duke Realty OP\ncommon units at March 31, 2022\n185.04\nMultiplied by price of Prologis common stock on June 30, 2022\n$ 117.65\nEstimated fair value of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common\nunits to be issued\n$ 21,770\nEstimated transaction costs\n312\nEstimated aggregate consideration\n$22,082\nDuke Realty shareholders and Duke Realty OP unitholders will receive 0.475 of a newly issued\nshare of Prologis common stock or 0.475 of a newly issued Prologis OP common unit, respectively,\nfor each share of Duke Realty common stock or Duke Realty OP common unit, respectively, that\nthey own as of immediately prior to consummation of the mergers.\nThe estimated purchase price is based on the closing price of Prologis common stock on June 30,\n2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Pursuant to\naccounting rules, the final purchase price will be based on the price of the Prologis common stock\nas of the closing date, and therefore, will be different from the amount shown above. Based\n178 \n (1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\non a sensitivity analysis, a change in the Prologis common stock price of 10% would result in an\napproximate $2.2 billion change in the estimated aggregate consideration.\nFor purposes of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, estimated transaction costs for the mergers\nwere included in the estimated aggregate consideration. These estimated transaction costs are\nexpected to be approximately $312 million and includes the direct cost incurred in acquiring the real\nestate assets. These costs will be capitalized by Prologis. Termination and severance costs for the\nacceleration of unvested Duke Realty equity awards and Duke Realty OP LTIP units under Duke\nRealty\u2019s equity incentive plans that become fully vested at closing are included in the estimated\nfair value of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units to be issued.\nThe Pro Forma Financial Statements included herein do not give effect to any synergies, potential cost\nreductions or other operating efficiencies that we expect to result from the mergers based on management\u2019s\nplans or intent after the mergers.\n179 \nTABLE OF

Allocation\nThe following preliminary allocation of the purchase price of Duke Realty is based on the preliminary\nestimate of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Duke Realty at March 31,\n2022. The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the fair value of such\nassets and liabilities as of the actual consummation date of the mergers and will be completed after the\nmergers are consummated. Such final determination of the purchase price may be significantly different from\nthe preliminary estimates used in the Pro Forma Financial Statements.\nThe estimated purchase price of Duke Realty of $22.1 billion (as calculated in the manner described above) is\nallocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and assumed liabilities based on the following\npreliminary basis at March 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nInvestments in real estate properties, net\n$ 25,811,836\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated entities\n211,239\nCash and other assets, including lease intangible assets\n1,144,702\nDebt\n(3,255,745\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, including lease\nintangible liabilities\n(1,823,394\nNoncontrolling interests\n(6,917\nTotal estimated purchase price, including transaction costs\n$22,081,721\nHistorical Financial Statements\nIn order to conform to the current Prologis presentation, we condensed and reclassified certain amounts\npresented in the historical financial statements of Duke Realty.\nDuke Realty Transaction Accounting Adjustments\nAdjustments for Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheets:\nUnless otherwise indicated, the pro forma adjustments apply to both Prologis and Prologis OP.\nDuke Realty\u2019s real estate assets have been adjusted to their estimated fair value at March 31, 2022. We\nestimated the fair value of each property generally by applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net\noperating income and adding a portfolio premium to the property based on the relative fair value of the\nproperty in comparison to the total portfolio. We determined the capitalization rates that were\nappropriate by market, based on recent appraisals, transactions or other market data. The fair value of\nland is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar\nparcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale.\nDuke Realty\u2019s historical accumulated depreciation balance is eliminated.\nDuke Realty\u2019s investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities have been adjusted to their\nestimated fair value at March 31, 2022. The fair values for the investments were calculated using similar\nvaluation methods as those used for consolidated real estate assets and debt.\nAt March 31, 2022, Duke Realty had no properties that were classified as held for sale. Prologis intends\nto dispose of certain of the acquired real estate assets from Duke Realty, including non-strategic\nlogistics properties, over the next 12 months. There was no pro forma adjustment made to reflect\nPrologis\u2019 future intent to sell these properties.\n186 \n)\n)\n)\n(F) \n(1) \n(2) \n(G) \n(H) \n(1) \n(2) \n(I) \n(J) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdjustments to Duke Realty\u2019s historical balance of other assets are as follows (in thousands):\nElimination of straight-line rent receivable\n$(182,673\nElimination of previously acquired lease intangible assets and goodwill\n(428,875\nElimination of lease right-of-use assets\n(73,634\nRecognition of value of acquired lease intangible assets\n838,778\nRecognition of value of acquired lease right-of-use assets\n75,171\nTotal\n$228,767\nThe fair value of acquired lease intangible assets includes leasing commissions, foregone rent and\nabove market leases. We recognize an asset for leasing commissions based on our estimate of the\ncost to lease space in the applicable markets. Foregone rents include the value of the revenue and\nrecovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the space was vacant, in each\nof the applicable markets. An asset was recognized for acquired leases with in-place rents that are\nhigher than our best estimate of current market rents in each of the applicable markets.\nDuke Realty\u2019s lease right-of-use assets for ground and office space leases, in which Duke Realty is\nthe lessee, were adjusted to their estimated value at March 31, 2022. We estimated the value of each\nlease by calculating the present value of the future minimum rental payments at March 31, 2022\nusing Prologis\u2019 weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 5.2%. The weighted average\nremaining lease term for these leases was forty-four years at March 31, 2022.\nDuke Realty\u2019s debt balances have been adjusted to their estimated fair value at March 31, 2022. Fair\nvalue was estimated based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and\nmarket interest rates that would have been available to us for the issuance of debt with similar terms and\nremaining maturities.\nAdjustments to Duke Realty\u2019s historical balance of other liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nElimination of deferred revenue\n$\n(46,401\nElimination of previously acquired lease intangible liabilities\n(68,648\nElimination of deferred financing costs\n6,280\nElimination of lease liabilities\n(80,494\nRecognition of value of acquired lease intangible liabilities\n1,335,670\nRecognition of value of acquired lease liabilities\n75,171\nTotal\n$1,221,578\nThe fair value of acquired lease intangible liabilities includes a liability for acquired leases with in-\nplace rents that are lower than our best estimate of current market rents in each of the applicable\nmarkets.\nDuke Realty\u2019s lease liabilities for ground and office space leases, in which Duke Realty is the\nlessee, were adjusted to their estimated value at March 31, 2022. We estimated the value of each\nlease by calculating the present value of the future minimum rental payments at March 31, 2022\nusing Prologis\u2019 weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 5.2%. The weighted average\nremaining lease term for these leases was forty-four years at March 31, 2022.\nAdjustments represent the elimination of historical Duke Realty balances and the issuance of Prologis\ncommon stock and Prologis OP common units in exchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock and\nDuke Realty OP common units, respectively, in the mergers. The adjustment for the Duke Realty OP\nunitholders is based on the Duke Realty OP unitholders\u2019 share of the total net asset pro forma\nadjustments at March 31, 2022. This adjustment reflected the Duke Realty OP unitholders\u2019 ownership\npercentage of 1.3% at March 31, 2022.\nThe adjustment for noncontrolling interests in the consolidated entities at March 31, 2022 is based on\nthe noncontrolling interests\u2019 share in the fair value adjustments for real estate and debt as described\nabove.\n187 \n)\n)\n)\n(1)\n(2)\n)\n)\n)\n(1)\n(2)\n(K) \n(L) \n(M) \n(N) \n(O) \n(P) \n(4) \n(Q) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdjustments for Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income:\nThe pro forma adjustments to the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income assume that a\npurchase price allocation done as of January 1, 2021 was equivalent to amounts assigned based on the\nestimated purchase price allocation done at March 31, 2022 and reflected in the Pro Forma Condensed\nCombined Balance Sheets.\nRental revenue is adjusted to remove Duke Realty\u2019s historical straight-line rent and amortization of the\nnet below market lease intangible liability of $10.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, and $32.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Rental revenue is further adjusted to recognize acquired leases on a straight-line\nbasis and the amortization of the net below market lease intangible liability of $9.3 million and $56.4\nmillion, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and $59.5 million and $238.6 million,\nrespectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of the above or below market rent\nadjustments, we estimated a weighted average remaining lease term associated with these leases of five\nyears.\nWe expect that the mergers will create significant corporate general and administrative as well as\nproperty operating cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving\nthese anticipated cost savings. Therefore, the Pro Forma Financial Statements included herein do not\ngive effect to any synergies, potential cost reductions or other operating efficiencies that we expect to\nresult from the mergers based on management\u2019s plans or intent after the mergers.\nDepreciation and amortization expense is adjusted to remove $94.0 million and $362.1 million of Duke\nRealty\u2019s historical depreciation and amortization expense and recognize $193.7 million and $821.2 million\nof depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and the year\nended December 31, 2021, respectively. For purposes of this adjustment, we estimated the various\ncomponents of the real estate acquired and used an estimated average useful life of 30 years for\noperating properties and an estimated weighted average remaining lease term associated with in-place\nleases at March 31, 2022 that approximated five years.\nWe adjusted Duke Realty\u2019s investment in unconsolidated entities to fair value. As a result, we adjusted\nthe equity in earnings that Duke Realty recognized from these entities to reflect the impact the\namortization of these fair value adjustments would have had on earnings from these unconsolidated\nentities.\nWe adjusted Duke Realty\u2019s interest expense based on the fair value of debt. The adjustment to interest\nexpense includes the removal of Duke Realty\u2019s historical interest expense, including amortization of\ndeferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and calculation of interest expense based on\nthe estimated fair value of acquired debt, net of amounts capitalized. The weighted average interest rate\nassociated with the debt at fair value was 4.5% at March 31, 2022 (see note G).\nAn adjustment was made to reflect the income allocated to noncontrolling interests in the co-investment\nentities that Duke Realty consolidates to reflect the impact the amortization of these fair value\nadjustments would have had on the earnings of the noncontrolling interests or third parties. In addition,\nan adjustment was made to reflect the Duke Realty OP unitholders\u2019 ownership percentage of 1.3% in all\nof the pro forma adjustments described above.\nCombined Pro Forma

All such insurance policies are in\nfull force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, Parent and the Parent\nSubsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of such insurance policies, and no\nwritten notice of cancelation or termination has been received by Parent with respect to any such insurance\npolicy other than in connection with ordinary course renewals.\nSection 5.19 Information Supplied.
