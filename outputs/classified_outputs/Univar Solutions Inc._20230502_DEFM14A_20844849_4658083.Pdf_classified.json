        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 87)\nGeneral\nEach of Parent and the Company has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts\nto take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with one another in doing, all\nthings necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or nonactions, waivers, consents,\nclearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations or waiting periods from governmental entities as described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014 Regulatory Efforts and Related Matters.\u201d These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act (as\ndefined below), CFIUS Approval (as defined below), and certain specific other filings and related approvals under the antitrust and foreign\ninvestment laws of other jurisdictions as described further below.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nThe Merger is subject to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder (which we refer to as the \u201cHSR Act\u201d). A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or\ntermination of a 30-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission\n(which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for\nadditional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the\nparties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second\nRequest, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. The parties made the required\nfilings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 27, 2023, and the initial 30-day waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 26, 2023.\nAt any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR\nAct, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking\nto enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate\nassets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such\naction under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion\nof the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws\nunder certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nIn addition, the Merger is subject to approval by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (which we refer to as\n\u201cCFIUS\u201d), which requires: (a) a written determination from CFIUS to the effect that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement do not\nconstitute a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d pursuant to 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.213, (b) a written determination from CFIUS to the effect that review or investigation\nof the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been concluded and that a determination has been made that there are no\nunresolved national security concerns and all action under the CFIUS laws has been concluded, or (c) following an investigation conducted by\nCFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.507, CFIUS has reported the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to the President of the United\nStates and either (i) the President of the United States has made a decision not to suspend or prohibit such transactions pursuant to his authorities\nunder Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, or (ii) the President of the United States has not taken any action within 15 days from the\ndate he received the report from CFIUS (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cCFIUS Approval\u201d). The parties submitted a draft notice to CFIUS on\nMarch 30, 2023 and a formal notice on April 24, 2023.\n \n-6-Table of Contents\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nIn addition to HSR clearance and CFIUS Approval, the Merger is also subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other\njurisdictions under their applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws. These include antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the European\nUnion, Mexico and Turkey, as well as foreign investment approvals in France, Italy and Spain. Each of the foregoing filings, or drafts thereof, were\nsubmitted to the relevant government authority on or before April 10, 2023. On April 24, 2023, the parties obtained clearance from the\nSuperintendency of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense in Brazil.\nIn each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the Merger or the applicable\nwaiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make\nthese filings as promptly as practicable. The relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they\ndeem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, requiring the parties to license, or hold separate,\nassets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to commit to certain undertakings with respect to the\noperations of the Parent or Company after the Closing.",

If you attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your vote will\nrevoke any proxy previously submitted.\n \nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\n \nA:\nAt the Effective Time, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash, without interest, subject to any required tax\nwithholding, for each share of Univar Solutions common stock that you own (other than Cancelled Shares, Owned Company Shares, Dissenting\nShares and shares covered by Univar Solutions Restricted Share Awards (as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Merger Consideration\u201d) immediately prior to the Effective Time. For example, if you own 100 shares of Univar Solutions common\nstock, you will receive $3,615 in cash in exchange for your shares of Univar Solutions common stock (other than any Cancelled Shares, Owned\nCompany Shares, Dissenting Shares and shares covered by Univar Solutions Restricted Share Awards), without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. Cancelled Shares are shares of Univar Solutions common stock owned by Univar Solutions as treasury stock or otherwise or by\nParent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of\nthird parties). Owned Company Shares are shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of\nUnivar Solutions (other than shares held in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of third parties). Dissenting Shares are shares of\nUnivar Solutions common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders who have properly\ndemanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have complied in all respects with\nSection 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares and have not waived, effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under Delaware law\nwith respect to such shares. Univar Solutions Restricted Share Awards are shares of Univar Solutions common stock granted subject to any time-\nbased vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each\noutstanding Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award, Univar Solutions PRSU Award, Univar Solutions RSU Award, Univar Solutions DSU Award\nand Univar Solutions Option will be cashed out based on the Merger Consideration, less any required tax withholding and deductions and less the\napplicable per share exercise price in the case of a Univar Solutions Option, with the number of Univar Solutions common stock to be cashed out\nfor each Univar Solutions PRSU Award equal to: (A) for each such award granted in 2021, the greater of (i) 170% of the target number of shares\ncovered by the award and (ii) the number of shares covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through the period\nending on the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs, (B) for each such award\ngranted in 2022, the greater of (i) 150% of the target number of shares covered by the award and (ii) the number of shares of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through the period ending on the last day of the calendar\nmonth immediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs and (C) for each such award granted on or following January 1,\n2023, the target number of shares covered by such award.\n \nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Univar Solutions common stock?\n \nA:\nThe exchange of Univar Solutions common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAccordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014Material\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) who exchanges shares of Univar Solutions common stock for cash in the Merger generally\nwill recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Univar Solutions common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.\n \n-16-\nTable of Contents\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not\naddress any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders\nwho are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to you of the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?\n \nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to\napprove the Merger Agreement Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special\nMeeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation\nProposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Univar Solutions common stock representing a majority of the voting power present\nin person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is\nrequired for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Univar Solutions stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (b) grant\na proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special\nMeeting\u2014Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d)\u037e or (c) attend the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nAgreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special\nMeeting, for Univar Solutions stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, such abstention\nwill have the same effect as if the Univar Solutions stockholder voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal\nand the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee\nhow to vote your shares (resulting in a so-called \u201cbroker non-votes\u201d) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called \u201cbroker\nnon-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules\nprovide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter\nand have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. Univar Solutions does not expect any broker non-\nvotes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority\nto vote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine,\u201d and each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered \u201cnon-routine.\u201d\nAs a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Univar Solutions common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving\ninstructions. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares\nrepresented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e\nand (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\n \nA:\nThe presence, in person or by proxy (including solely by means of remote communication) of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of\nthe Univar Solutions common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.\nBecause there were 157,741,392 shares of Univar Solutions common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record Date, we will need\nholders of at least 78,870,697 shares present in person or by proxy (including solely by\n \n-17-\nTable of Contents\nmeans of remote communication) at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is\nexpected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Univar Solutions stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Univar Solutions\nstockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Univar Solutions common stock. Instead, Univar Solutions will remain an independent\npublic company, Univar Solutions common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and\nUnivar Solutions will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Univar Solutions will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$204,190,000, or Parent will be required to pay Univar Solutions a termination fee of $291,690,000 or $379,200,000, as described in the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees.\u201d \n \nQ:\nWhy are Univar Solutions stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?\n \nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Univar Solutions to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with respect to certain\npayments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if Univar Solutions stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is\nan advisory vote and will not be binding on Univar Solutions. Therefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the\nMerger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Univar Solutions\u2019 named executive\nofficers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\n \nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along\nwith all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and\nhow it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or\ngrant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares\nin \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\n \nQ:\nShould I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?\n \nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will send each holder of record of an outstanding certificate a letter of transmittal and\ninstructions that explain how to exchange shares of Univar Solutions common stock represented by such holder\u2019s certificates for the Merger\nConsideration. Also after the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent will send each holder of uncertificated shares represented by book entry the\nMerger Consideration for each such book-entry share upon receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of\ntransfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request).\n \n-18-\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you\nsell or transfer your shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements\n(such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies\nUnivar Solutions in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,\nto the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or\notherwise transfer your shares of Univar Solutions common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed\nproxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the\ninstructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d).\n \nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a Univar Solutions stockholder of record and holding shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d as a beneficial\nowner?\n \nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with Univar Solutions\u2019 transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered a stockholder\nof record with respect to these shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Univar Solutions.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are often said to hold these shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and are considered\n\u201cbeneficial owners\u201d of those shares. In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is\nconsidered, with respect to those shares, to be the Univar Solutions stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct\nyour bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual\nSpecial Meeting.\n \nQ:\nHow may I vote?\n \nA:\nThere are three ways to vote before the meeting if you are a record holder (i.e., you do not hold your shares through a broker, bank or other\nnominee):\n \n\u2022\nBy Internet: If you have Internet access, the Board of Directors encourages you to vote at www.proxydocs.com/unvr by following the\ninstructions on the proxy card\u037e\n \n\u2022\nBy Telephone: As instructed on the proxy card, by making a toll-free telephone call from the U.S. or Canada to 1 (866) 895-6933\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nBy Mail: If you received your proxy materials by mail, you can vote by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the\nprepaid envelope provided.\nYou can also vote at the virtual Special Meeting, which will be held on June 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time at www.proxydocs.com/unvr (unless\nthe Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).\nIf you hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock as a beneficial owner in \u201cstreet name\u201d as of the Record Date, (i) you will receive separate\ninstructions from your bank, broker, or other nominee describing how to vote your shares\u037e and (ii) if you want to vote during the virtual meeting,\nyou must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker, or other nominee and also register at www.proxydocs.com/unvr.

If you are a Univar Solutions stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should follow the voting instructions\nprovided by your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \nQ:\nIf a Univar Solutions stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\n \nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for\nor against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by\nyour properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\n \nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special\nMeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote.

For\nexample, you may own some shares directly as a Univar Solutions stockholder of record and other shares through a broker, or you may own shares\nthrough more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials.

Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each\nproxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\n \nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another Univar Solutions\nstockholder?\n \nA:\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with\nrespect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This\nprocess, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for\ncompanies. Univar Solutions and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an\naddress, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or\nUnivar Solutions that they or Univar Solutions will be sending householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are\nnotified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a\nseparate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if\nyour shares are held in a brokerage account or Univar Solutions if you hold registered shares.

Univar Solutions estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $35,000 plus an additional fee per call made or received, plus\nreimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of Univar Solutions\u2019 ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and Univar\nSolutions\u2019 management periodically review, consider and assess Univar Solutions\u2019 operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry\nconditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, as compared to the benefits and risks of continued operation as a\nstand-alone, publicly traded company, and have sometimes included outside financial and legal advisors. Such reviews have been accompanied by\nperiodic conversations between senior executives or members of the Board of Directors of Univar Solutions and their counterparts at other companies\nregarding such potential transactions and opportunities.\nOn October 29, 2022, a representative of Brenntag, a global chemicals distribution company, contacted Mr. Christopher D. Pappas, the Company\u2019s\nChairperson, to schedule time to speak about Brenntag\u2019s views on Univar Solutions and other potential opportunities. Following that outreach, on\nNovember 13, 2022, the representative of Brenntag and Mr. Pappas spoke telephonically. During the meeting, the representative from Brenntag inquired if\nUnivar Solutions would consider an offer to acquire the Company. Mr. Pappas responded that he would bring any proposal provided by Brenntag to\nUnivar Solutions would consider an offer to acquire the Company. Mr. Pappas responded that he would bring any proposal provided by Brenntag to\nUnivar Solutions\u2019 Board of Directors for consideration, and subsequently advised the Board of Directors of the outreach from Brenntag.\n \n-33-Table of Contents\nOn November 14, 2022, Brenntag provided an initial offer letter to Mr. Pappas containing a nonbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company\u2019s\nissued and outstanding shares of common stock for $37.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cNovember 14\nBrenntag Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 46% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $25.70 and a 27% premium over\nUnivar Solutions\u2019 closing share price of $29.50 on November 11, 2022, the last trading date prior to the November 14 Brenntag Proposal. The offer letter\nstated that its submission had received all internal approvals necessary to submit the nonbinding proposal. The offer letter further noted that the\nNovember 14 Brenntag Proposal was subject to confirmatory due diligence and that Brenntag had conducted regulatory analysis and was confident the\ntransaction could obtain required approvals in a timely manner. The November 14 Brenntag Proposal did not include any proposed commitments by\nBrenntag with respect to regulatory efforts that Brenntag would agree to undertake to consummate a transaction. Mr. Pappas promptly shared the\nNovember 14 Brenntag Proposal with the Board of Directors.\nOn November 16, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of Univar Solutions\u2019\nmanagement, representatives of Univar Solutions\u2019 financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, and representatives of Univar Solutions\u2019\noutside legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), participated. At the meeting, Mr. Pappas described Univar Solutions\u2019 contacts\nwith Brenntag, including the November 13, 2022, discussion and November 14 Brenntag Proposal. A representative of Wachtell Lipton provided an\noverview of the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank discussed with the members of the Board of Directors the current market landscape and Univar\nSolutions\u2019 historical performance based on publicly available information and information provided by Univar Solutions\u2019 management. Representatives of\nWachtell Lipton reviewed the potential regulatory approval process that would be required to consummate a transaction with Brenntag, as well as the\nfeasibility and likely timing of such approvals, and the risk to Univar Solutions related to such approvals. The Board of Directors proposed to meet again\non November 20, 2022, to discuss further the proposal. Members of Univar Solutions\u2019 management also discussed the Company\u2019s recent performance in\nthe context of Univar Solutions\u2019 strategic plan, and directed that the Univar LRSP, as defined and described in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201c\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d, be used by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank in preparing their financial analysis with respect to Univar Solutions\nand any potential transaction.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board of Directors on November 16, 2022, the Board of Directors determined to retain Goldman Sachs and Deutsche\nBank as financial advisors to Univar Solutions and its Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the November 14 Brenntag Proposal,\nincluding the evaluation of potential alternatives. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank were selected based on their qualifications, expertise and reputation\nin the chemicals industry and their knowledge of the business and affairs of Univar Solutions. Prior to their engagement, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche\nBank provided disclosure regarding their relationships with Univar Solutions and Brenntag.\nOn November 20, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar\nSolutions\u2019 management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche\nBank each independently reviewed with the Board of Directors preliminary financial information relating to the November 14 Brenntag Proposal, based on\nthe Univar LRSP. The Board of Directors discussed the potential valuation of Univar Solutions that could be achieved upon the successful execution of\nUnivar Solutions\u2019 business plan and the expected regulatory approvals required for a transaction with Brenntag and the likelihood that a transaction with\nBrenntag would be completed, and the commitments that might be required from various regulators to obtain such approvals. In light of Brenntag\u2019s\nsignificant competitive overlap with Univar Solutions, Univar Solutions\u2019 management and Board of Directors determined that greater clarity with respect\nto the extent of Brenntag\u2019s commitment to obtain the required regulatory approvals for a transaction should be obtained before providing Brenntag with\naccess to due diligence information with respect to Univar Solutions. Following the discussion, the Board of Directors directed Univar Solutions to\nrespond to the Brenntag\u2019s offer to seek a higher price per share and greater regulatory certainty.\n \n-34-\nTable of Contents\nOn November 22, 2022, Mr. Pappas and David Jukes, the Chief Executive Officer of Univar Solutions, met virtually with representatives of Brenntag.\nMr. Pappas and Mr. Jukes informed the representatives of Brenntag that the November 14 Brenntag Proposal was insufficient, taking into account the\nviews of the Board of Directors as to what Brenntag would reasonably be capable of paying (including a fair allocation of value from potential synergies)\nand the risk to Univar Solutions, regulatory and otherwise, entailed in a potential transaction with Brenntag, and that Univar Solutions would require a\nmore detailed and substantial regulatory commitment prior to providing due diligence with respect to Univar Solutions and its business, but that Univar\nSolutions was willing to enter into discussions with Brenntag, subject to the receipt of a revised proposal acceptable to the Board of Directors and\nexecution of a customary confidentiality agreement.\nOn November 25, 2022, Bloomberg News published an article online indicating that the Company was attracting takeover interest from Brenntag. In\nresponse, Brenntag confirmed it was in preliminary discussions with Univar Solutions. Later in the evening of November 25, 2022, Univar Solutions\nissued a statement confirming receipt of a preliminary indication of interest from Brenntag. On November 23, 2022, the last trading date that closed prior to\nthe publication of the Bloomberg News article, the closing price for shares of Univar Solutions common stock was $31.02.\nOn November 26, 2022, Brenntag provided an updated offer letter to Univar Solutions containing a nonbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the\nCompany\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $40.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash (which we refer to as the\n\u201cNovember 26 Brenntag Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 50% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $27.04 and a\n35% premium over Univar Solutions\u2019 closing share price of $29.97 on November 22, 2022, the last trading date before volumes increased ahead of public\nconfirmation of Brenntag\u2019s approach. The letter noted that the other terms and conditions of the November 14 Brenntag Proposal remained in effect, and\nthat the proposal was conditioned on full and satisfactory access to due diligence and a mutually acceptable approach on regulatory approvals. The\nNovember 26 Brenntag Proposal did not include any additional details with respect to the regulatory commitments that Brenntag would be willing to make\nin connection with any transaction.\nOn November 27, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, to discuss the November 26 Brenntag Proposal,\nwith the participation of members of Univar Solutions\u2019 management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton.\nFollowing a brief review of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, under Delaware law, the representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided an\noverview of a suggested response that had been developed by Univar Solutions\u2019 financial and legal advisors, noting that it aligned with the prior\nguidance from the Board of Directors on requirements for access to diligence, including an expectation that Brenntag would further increase its offer\nfollowing due diligence, and that Brenntag make substantial commitments regarding regulatory efforts, potential termination fees and its obligation to\nlitigate against any regulatory challenges as a pre-condition to gaining access to diligence. Members of the Board of Directors further discussed the\nproposal and potential responses, including in the context of Univar Solutions\u2019 stand-alone plan, and potential acquirors identified by the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisors, including the attractiveness of the Company to potential financial acquirors. The Board of Directors directed representatives of the\nCompany, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton to respond to Brenntag\u2019s revised offer and provide limited access to due diligence\nmaterials and to coordinate outreach to other potential acquirors.\nOn November 27, 2022, representatives of Univar Solutions contacted representatives of Brenntag to request a revised offer letter reflecting the\nrequirements specified in the proposed framework approved by the Board of Directors, including regarding the need for the strongest possible\ncommitment with respect to regulatory efforts, a substantial reverse termination fee and Brenntag\u2019s obligation to litigate any regulatory challenges if\nregulators objected to the potential transaction.\nAdditionally, between November 27, 2022, and December 3, 2022, Univar Solutions and Brenntag and their representatives negotiated the terms of a\nconfidentiality agreement and related clean team agreement. On\n \n-35-\nTable of Contents\nDecember 3, 2022, Univar Solutions and Brenntag entered into a confidentiality agreement, which included a customary standstill provision. The\nstandstill provision of the confidentiality agreement included a customary fall-away and permits proposals to be communicated confidentially to Univar\nSolutions\u2019 chief executive officer and Board of Directors. Thereafter, Univar Solutions and its representatives provided limited historical non-public due\ndiligence information to certain clean team representatives of Brenntag to assist in Brenntag\u2019s regulatory analysis, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nengaged in calls with such representatives of Brenntag discussing matters related to that analysis. Throughout the month of December, representatives\nof Wachtell Lipton provided data and information on Univar Solutions, as well as industry data and information, to representatives of Brenntag\u2019s outside\ncounsel pursuant to the clean team agreement for the purpose of better evaluating the regulatory risk presented by a potential transaction.\nFollowing the November 27, 2022 Board meeting, as directed by the Board of Directors, representatives from Univar Solutions, Goldman Sachs and\nDeutsche Bank spoke telephonically, in person and virtually with 12 financial sponsors to assess their interest in a potential acquisition of or strategic\ntransaction involving Univar Solutions. In addition, representatives of Univar Solutions, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank responded to four inbound\ninquiries from additional potential counterparties. Over the next several weeks, in addition to formal meetings of the Board of Directors, Mr. Pappas and\nmembers of the Company\u2019s senior management periodically briefed and received input from members of the Board of Directors as to the discussions with\nrepresentatives of certain of the potential acquirors.\nOn November 29, 2022, Mr. Pappas had a telephonic discussion with a partner at Apollo to discuss whether Apollo would be interested in exploring\na potential acquisition of the Company, who indicated Apollo would be interested in a potential transaction. Also on November 29, 2022, Brenntag sent\nUnivar Solutions a revised letter (which we refer to as the \u201cNovember 29 Brenntag Letter\u201d) noting that it was not certain it could support any further price\nincreases and that it was committed to working towards determining a regulatory framework that would lead to a successful closing, but that it needed\nadditional diligence before it could provide clarity on its regulatory commitments.\nOn December 1, 2022, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of Univar Solutions\u2019\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. The Board of Directors discussed recent developments,\nsummarized the status of discussions with Brenntag and outreach to financial sponsors that Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank had identified and other\npotentially interested parties. The Board of Directors discussed the November 29 Brenntag Letter and potential responses, including in the context of\nUnivar Solutions\u2019 stand-alone plan and maintaining competitive pressure on Brenntag and other potentially interested parties. After this discussion, the\nBoard of Directors directed management, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to seek commitments from Brenntag regarding regulatory efforts, potential\ntermination fees, and its obligation to litigate as a pre-condition to gaining additional access to diligence, and continue outreach to and, subject to\nexecution of a confidentiality agreement, provide due diligence to, other potential acquirors.\nOn December 1, 2022, representatives of Univar Solutions requested that representatives of Brenntag provide a revised offer letter reflecting the\nproposed regulatory framework and expedited timeline and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Brenntag\u2019s legal counsel had a telephonic discussion\nregarding these topics.\nAlso on December 1, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Apollo. Between December 1, 2022 and\nDecember 8, 2022, Univar Solutions and Apollo negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Apollo\u2019s\noutside legal counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), participating in such negotiations. On December 8, 2022, Univar\nSolutions and Apollo entered into a confidentiality agreement containing a customary standstill and standstill fall-away and permitting Apollo to make\nconfidential proposals to Univar Solutions\u2019 chief executive officer and Board of Directors.\n \n-36-\nTable of Contents\nBetween December 1, 2022, and January 15, 2023, representatives of Univar Solutions, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank shared draft\nconfidentially agreements with 12 financial sponsors, including Apollo and Sponsor A (as defined below), that had indicated interest in a potential\ntransaction with Univar Solutions and negotiated and executed confidentiality agreements with nine. Each of the executed confidentiality agreements\ncontained a customary standstill, customary fall-away and permits proposals to be communicated confidentially to Univar Solutions\u2019 chief executive\nofficer and Board of Directors.\nOn December 4, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton had a virtual meeting with Brenntag\u2019s legal counsel regarding expected regulatory\napprovals and Univar Solutions\u2019 position regarding regulatory efforts, potential termination fees and its obligation to litigate and provided Brenntag\u2019s\nlegal counsel and economists with copies of requested regulatory information.\nOn December 7, 2022, Mr. Pappas had breakfast with a representative of a U.S.-based private equity firm (\u201cSponsor A\u201d), who expressed interest in a\npotential transaction with Univar Solutions. Mr. Pappas directed the representatives of Sponsor A to contact Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nSponsor A had been among the parties identified as a potential acquiror by Univar Solutions\u2019 financial advisors and discussed by the Board of Directors.\nThat evening, representatives of Deutsche Bank sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Sponsor A. Between December 7, 2022 and December 12, 2022,\nUnivar Solutions and Sponsor A negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Sponsor A\u2019s counsel\nparticipating in such negotiations.

At the meeting, Mr.\nJukes and the chief executive officer of Brenntag discussed, among other things, Univar Solutions\u2019 business, Brenntag\u2019s views regarding the potential\ntransaction and the progress that had been made on legal workstreams. Mr. Jukes and the chief executive officer of Brenntag agreed to meet again in\nperson on December 20, 2022 if satisfactory progress on regulatory issues and related workstreams had been achieved so as to justify more expansive\ndiligence. Also on December 9, 2022, representatives from Goldman Sachs had discussions with representatives from Apollo regarding the scheduling of\na management presentation with members of Univar Solutions\u2019 management.\nBetween December 13, 2022, and January 20, 2023, Univar Solutions\u2019 management provided initial management presentations to nine financial\nsponsors that had indicated interest in a potential transaction with Univar Solutions (including Apollo and Sponsor A), all of whom had executed\nconfidentiality agreements with Univar Solutions.

Apollo and Platinum Falcon included with the Apollo March 6 Proposal executed Debt Commitment Letters,\nwhich were subject to the completion of confirmatory due diligence, the negotiation of definitive transaction documentation and certain other conditions.\nThe Apollo March 6 Proposal noted that Apollo and Platinum Falcon had completed substantially all due diligence and had received requisite approvals\nto proceed with the Apollo March 6 Proposal. The Apollo March 6 Proposal also stated that (i) Apollo\u2019s funds and Platinum Falcon had the ability to\nfund 100% of the equity requirements for Apollo\u2019s proposed transaction, (ii) Apollo and Platinum Falcon were willing to agree to a \u201chell or high water\u201d\nstandard on regulatory efforts and (iii) Apollo and Platinum Falcon were in a position to negotiate definitive documentation with Univar Solutions and\nannounce a transaction by March 13, 2023. As a next step, the Apollo March 6 Proposal suggested that the parties and their advisors engage\nimmediately, including with respect to customary confirmatory due diligence and to finalize the merger agreement and other transaction documents.\nBetween March 6, 2023, and March 12, 2023, the parties\u2019 respective management teams and legal and financial advisors and those of the debt\nfinancing parties engaged in extensive negotiations regarding the terms of the debt commitment letters and related documentation.\nOn March 7, 2023, Univar Solutions held a regular meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar Solutions\u2019\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Pappas facilitated a discussion by the Board of Directors\nabout the status of discussions with potential acquirors, including Apollo and Platinum Falcon and Sponsor A, as well as with other parties who had\npreviously been engaged in the sale process. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then provided an overview of the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties\nunder Delaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions. The representatives from Wachtell Lipton then guided\nthe Board of Directors in a discussion and review of the draft merger agreement and related transaction documents, including the equity commitment\nletter, limited guarantee, and provisions thereof, including the non-solicitation provision, regulatory efforts covenant, conditions to closing, termination\nprovisions and termination fee. The representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank then reviewed with the Board of Directors preliminary\nfinancial information relating to Univar Solutions, including in scenarios where the Company continued to operate on a stand-alone basis as a public\ncompany or separated certain of its lines of business, based on the Univar Standalone Projections, as defined and described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d. Prior to the meeting, each of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank had provided disclosure\nregarding their relationships with Univar Solutions, Apollo and Sponsor A, which was provided to the Board of Directors and management of Univar\nSolutions.\nFollowing this discussion, members of the Board of Directors further discussed the Apollo March 6 Proposal and Sponsor A March Proposal and\npotential responses with the representatives from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton, including in the context of Univar Solutions\u2019\nstand-alone plan, as well as the feasibility and attractiveness of separating Univar Solutions into certain lines of business.

The\nBoard of Directors then directed Univar Solutions\u2019 management and advisors to prepare a response to Apollo and Platinum Falcon that the Board of\nDirectors was unwilling to approve a transaction at the $35.00 price proposed and requested Apollo and Platinum Falcon provide a revised \u201cbest and\nfinal\u201d offer as discussed at the meeting.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board of Directors, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank conveyed Univar Solutions\u2019 response to\nthe Apollo March 6 Proposal telephonically to representatives of Apollo, including the need to provide a \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal and then be prepared\nto execute and announce a transaction by March 13 if the Board of Directors approved Apollo\u2019s and Platinum Falcon\u2019s revised proposal. Also on March\n7, Mr. Pappas discussed telephonically with representatives of Apollo that the Board of Directors was unwilling to transact at the $35 price proposed in\nthe Apollo March 6 Proposal and the Board of Directors\u2019 expectation that Apollo and Platinum Falcon would increase their offer price.\nAlso on March 7, 2023, representatives from Wachtell Lipton, Paul Weiss and Cleary along with representatives from Univar Solutions\u2019 and\nApollo\u2019s respective regulatory counsel, met virtually to discuss regulatory considerations related to Platinum Falcon\u2019s potential involvement in the\nacquisition of Univar Solutions.\nOn March 8, 2023, representatives from Wachtell Lipton provided revised drafts of the merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited\nguarantee to Paul Weiss and telephonically discussed certain open items in the merger agreement and other transaction documents (as the Board of\nDirectors had discussed on March 7, 2023), including the interim operating covenants and related exceptions, quantums of the applicable termination\nfees, regulatory efforts covenant and the outside date and non-solicitation provision.\nOn the evening of March 9, 2023, representatives from Wilmer Hale met virtually with representatives from Paul Weiss and Cleary to discuss\nregulatory considerations related to Platinum Falcon\u2019s potential involvement in the acquisition of Univar Solutions, including the expected regulatory\nefforts that had been discussed with the Board of Directors on March 7, 2023, and with respect to required antitrust and foreign direct investment\napprovals.\nOn March 10, 2023, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank conveyed Univar Solutions\u2019 response on several open items in the\nmerger agreement and related documentation to representatives of Apollo telephonically, including the outside date, which response had been discussed\nwith members of management and members of the Board of Directors.\nOn the morning of March 11, 2023, members of Univar Solutions\u2019 management conveyed Univar Solutions\u2019 response on several open items in the\nmerger agreement and

members of the Board of Directors.\n \n-46-\nTable of Contents\nLater on March 11, 2023, representatives of Apollo submitted Apollo\u2019s and Platinum Falcon\u2019s best and final offer to

Solutions, (ii) a six month outside date, subject to a three month extension if the closing conditions were satisfied or waived, other than those\nrelating to certain regulatory approvals, (iii) a Company termination fee equal to 3.5% of the equity value of the transaction, payable by Univar Solutions\nto Parent in the event that Univar Solutions or Parent terminated the agreement in specified circumstances, (iv) a parent termination fee equal to 6.25% of\nthe equity value of the transaction, payable by Parent (or Apollo and Platinum Falcon under the limited guarantee) in the event that Univar Solutions or\nParent terminated the agreement in specified circumstances and (v) a regulatory parent termination fee equal to 5% of the equity value of the transaction,\npayable by Parent (or Apollo and Platinum Falcon under the limited guarantee) in the event that the agreement were terminated due to the failure to attain\ncertain regulatory approvals (the \u201cFinal Apollo Proposal\u201d).\nFollowing receipt of the proposal, on March 11 and 12, 2023, representatives from Wachtell Lipton, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wilmer\nHale discussed telephonically and via e-mail certain open items in the merger agreement and other transaction documents with representatives of Apollo,\nPlatinum Falcon, Paul Weiss, Cleary and their regulatory legal counsel, including the regulatory efforts covenant, outside date and the quantums and\nmechanics of the termination fees, including that (i) Apollo and Platinum Falcon agree to a parent termination fee equal to 6.5% of the

return-or-destroy notices to potential acquirors that were actively engaged with respect to an alternative proposal (which would\npermit Sponsor A continued access to the Data Room following the execution of the merger agreement) and (iii) the regulatory efforts required by Parent,\nMerger Sub, Apollo and Platinum Falcon to consummate the transaction.\nOn March 12, 2023, Univar Solutions held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, with the participation of members of Univar\nSolutions\u2019 management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Pappas provided a summary of, and facilitated a\ndiscussion by the Board of Directors about, the status of discussions with Apollo, Platinum Falcon and Sponsor A, including the Final Apollo Proposal\nand the Sponsor A March Proposal. In particular, the Board of Directors discussed including the expected timeline to get to a signing with Apollo and\nPlatinum Falcon compared to Sponsor A, the remaining diligence to be done by Sponsor A and whether Sponsor A would be expected to stay within the\npurchase price range in the Sponsor A March Proposal following its completion of diligence and the negotiation of definitive documents. The\nrepresentatives from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank individually presented their respective financial analysis with respect to the Merger\nConsideration of $36.15 per share reflected in the Final Apollo Proposal, based on the Univar Standalone Projections. The representatives from Wachtell\nLipton then guided the Board of Directors in a discussion and review of the draft merger agreement and related transaction documents (which had been\nprovided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting), including the equity commitment letter, limited guarantee and debt commitment letters, including\nthe interim operating covenants, financing covenants, non-solicitation provision, regulatory efforts covenant, conditions to closing, termination\nprovisions and termination fee, and discussed how certain financing and regulatory provisions and the closing conditions affected the likelihood of\nclosing of a potential transaction. A representative of Wachtell Lipton then provided an overview of the Board of Directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire Univar Solutions. Following this discussion, members of the Board of Directors\nthen reviewed updated disclosures from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank regarding certain relationships with Apollo, Sponsor A, Platinum Falcon and\ntheir respective affiliates (which had been provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting), and Goldman Sachs\u2019 and Deutsche Bank\u2019s certain\nholdings and loan exposure in Univar Solutions, Apollo, Sponsor A, Platinum Falcon and their affiliates. Following this discussion, members of Univar\nSolutions\u2019 management discussed with the Board of Directors the proposed communications strategy in connection with the announcement of the\nproposed transaction. Following this discussion, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each rendered its respective oral opinion, each of which was\nsubsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 13, 2023, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, based upon and subject to\n \n-47-\nTable of Contents\nthe assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in their respective written opinions, the Merger Consideration to be received by the\nholders of Univar Solutions common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement, the Board of Directors consulted with Univar Solutions\u2019 senior management team, as well as Univar Solutions\u2019 financial and legal\nadvisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors that the Board of Directors viewed as supporting its decision:\n \n\u2022\nthe current and historical trading prices of shares of Univar Solutions common stock, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $36.15\nper share in cash represents a premium of approximately 20.6% to Univar Solutions\u2019 closing stock price on November 22, 2022, the last\ntrading date before volumes increased ahead of public confirmation of Brenntag\u2019s approach, and a premium of 33.6% to the 30-day volume-\nweighted average share price of Univar Solutions for the 30 trading days ending on November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including risks related to

Solutions\u2019\ncosts, margins and gross profit\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risk that Univar Solutions is not able to achieve projected financial performance, including the performance contemplated by the\nCompany Plans, based on, among other things, the Board of Directors\u2019 assessment of Univar Solutions\u2019 business, assets and prospects and\ncompetitive position, the views of the Board of Directors\u2019 financial advisors and the fact that longer-term forecasts called for overall\nfinancial performance of the standalone business above observed historical growth rates of the business and reflected a number of\nuncertain assumptions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing Univar Solutions\u2019 stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity\nimmediately upon the closing of the Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing equivalent\nvalue from Univar Solutions\u2019

related to succession planning for senior management, particularly Univar Solutions\u2019 chief executive officer, as well as the risks\nassociated with identifying or retaining potential successors

this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the\nMerger\u201d) and that Sponsor A had offered a valuation range of $35.00 to $37.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock in cash on\nMarch 3, 2023, the midpoint of which was below the Merger Consideration, and the Board of Directors\u2019 belief, based on\n \n-49-\nTable of Contents\ninteractions of representatives of Univar

the Merger Consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations, that the Equity Investors and Guarantors were prepared\nto enter into a fully negotiated equity commitment letter and limited

value) payable by Univar Solutions in certain circumstances was viewed by the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside\nlegal counsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances, comparable to termination fees of similar transactions and not\nlikely to preclude or deter any other party from making a competing acquisition proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe high probability that the Merger would be completed based on, among other things, Apollo\u2019s and Platinum Falcon\u2019s proven ability to\ncomplete large acquisition transactions, the absence of a

potentially negative factors:\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that, following the Merger, Univar Solutions will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders\nwill not participate in any future earnings or growth, and the possibility that, although the Merger provides Univar Solutions\u2019 stockholders\nthe opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which Univar Solutions\u2019 common stock traded prior to the public announcement of the\nMerger, the price of Univar Solutions\u2019 common stock might have increased in the future to a price greater than the Merger Consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner, or at all, due to a failure of certain conditions to the closing of the\nMerger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict Univar Solutions\u2019 ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations\nregarding alternative takeover proposals with third parties, subject to specified exceptions, and that require Univar Solutions to negotiate\nwith Parent (if Parent desires to propose revisions to the Merger Agreement and negotiate) prior to Univar Solutions being able to terminate\nthe Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe possibility that Univar Solutions\u2019 obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee of approximately $204.2 million to Parent upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirors from making an alternative\nproposal to acquire Univar Solutions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the\nMerger Agreement is adopted by Univar Solutions stockholders, as well as the risks that the required regulatory approvals will not be\nobtained or that the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent, Merger Sub and the Equity\nInvestors not having sufficient funds to complete the Merger, or that Parent, Merger Sub and the Equity Investors may otherwise not\nobtain sufficient funds to complete the Merger\u037e\n \n-52-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Limited Guarantee, provided by the\nGuarantors, guarantees Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the $379.2\nmillion Parent Termination Fee, the approximately $291.7 million Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, certain other damages, certain\nassociated enforcement costs and certain other indemnification and reimbursement obligations\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of the business prior to the completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent Univar Solutions from\nundertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that an all-cash merger would be taxable to the stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the substantial time\nand effort of management required to consummate the Merger and related disruptions to the operation of Univar Solutions\u2019 business\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that Univar Solutions\u2019 remedies in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated may be limited to the $379.2 million Parent\nTermination Fee or the approximately $291.7 million Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, payable by Parent under certain circumstances,\ncertain other damages, and certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to\ncompensate Univar Solutions for any damage caused, and that such termination fees may not be available in all instances where the Merger\nis not consummated and, even if available, rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such\naction may be uncertain\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the failure to complete the\nMerger, and/or actions that Univar Solutions may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the Merger Agreement could have\nan adverse impact on existing and prospective business relationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees,\nincluding the risk that certain key members of Univar Solutions\u2019 management might choose not to remain employed with Univar Solutions\nprior to the completion of the Merger, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated therein\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, our\nstockholders generally (see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Univar Solutions\u2019 Executive Officers and Directors\nin the Merger\u201d).\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material\nfactors considered by the Board of Directors. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Univar Solutions and its\nstockholders, and recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, the Board of Directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign\nany relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to\ndifferent factors. The Board of Directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered, but determined,\nin its business judgment, that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of\napproving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking\nstatements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d \n \n-53-\nTable of Contents\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nAt the March 12, 2023 meeting of the Board of Directors, Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to the Company, rendered its oral opinion to the Board\nof Directors, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 13, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be\npaid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial\npoint of view to such holders of Univar Solutions common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 13, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services\nand its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\nis not a recommendation as to how any holder of Univar Solutions common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other\nthings:\n \n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain other communications from the Company to its stockholders\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe Univar Standalone Projections, as approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the Company.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current\nbusiness operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Univar Solutions\ncommon stock\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the chemical distribution industry and in other industries\u037e and\nperformed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering the opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company\u2019s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of\nall of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any\nresponsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company\u2019s consent that the Univar Standalone\nProjections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company.\nGoldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-\nbalance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman\nSachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained\nwithout any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger\nwill be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which\nwould be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transaction or the relative merits of\nthe transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available\n \n-54-\nTable of Contents\nto the Company, including a non-binding indication of interest for a transaction proposed by a third party that may have resulted in a higher price per\nshare of Univar Solutions common stock in cash than in the Merger, which indication of interest the Company advised Goldman Sachs that the Company\ndetermined not to pursue\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $36.15 in\ncash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not\nexpress any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or\ninstrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or\nany consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company\u037e nor\nas to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or\nclass of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. In addition, Goldman\nSachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Univar Solutions common stock will trade at any time or as to the potential effects\nof volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability\nof the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is\nnecessarily based on economic, monetary market and other condition as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date\nof its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or\nevents occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses of Goldman Sachs\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors in connection with rendering\nthe opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary\nand are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the\nextent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 10, 2023, and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis \nGoldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for Univar Solutions common stock for the period beginning on June 17, 2015\nand ending March 10, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 1, 2022, the date of the Company\u2019s\nafter-market close announcement of third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings, (ii) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on\nNovember 22, 2022, the date when trading volumes of Univar Solutions common stock significantly increased ahead of public announcement of talks\nbetween the Company and Brenntag on November 25, 2022, (iii) the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as \u201cVWAP\u201d) per share of Univar\nSolutions common stock for the preceding 30-trading day period ending November 22, 2022, (iv) the highest intra-day price per share of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock over the 52-week period ended on November 22, 2022, (v) the closing price per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10,\n2023, and (vi) the median equity research analyst price target per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of March 10, 2023 (as described in greater\ndetail below).\n \n-55-\nTable of Contents\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:\n \n\u2022\na premium of 39% based on the closing price of $25.99 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 1, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\na premium of 21% based on the closing price of $29.97 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\na premium of 34% based on the volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock for the 30-trading day\nperiod ended November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\na premium of 6% based on the highest intra-day price of $34.00 per share of Univar Solutions common stock over the 52-week period ended\non November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\na premium of 13% based on the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023\u037e and\n \n\u2022\na discount of 6% based on the median analyst price target of $38.50 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of March 10, 2023.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis \nUsing the Univar Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a\nrange of illustrative present values per share of Univar Solutions common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount\nrates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as\nof December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as reflected in the Univar\nStandalone Projections (including estimates of the Company\u2019s tax-effected pension balance as net debt rather than treating pension costs as an annual\ncash expense) and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated by applying terminal year exit enterprise value (which\nwe refer to as \u201cEV\u201d) to last twelve months (which we refer to as \u201cLTM\u201d) Adjusted EBITDA multiples ranging from 7.0x to 10.0x, to a terminal year estimate\nof the Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by the Company, as reflected in the Univar Standalone Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth\nrates ranging from 0.4% to 5.4%). The range of terminal year exit EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of the Company. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by\napplication of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which we refer to as \u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the Company\u2019s\ntarget capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and\na beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman\nSachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the amount of the Company\u2019s net debt, $2,336 million\n(inclusive of pension liabilities), as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of\nillustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted\noutstanding shares of the Company, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, using the treasury stock\nmethod, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Univar Solutions common stock ranging from $33.56 to $55.85. Goldman Sachs\ncompared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of Univar Solutions common\nstock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as of November 22, 2022, and\nthe Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.\n \n-56-\nTable of Contents\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis \nUsing the Univar Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future\nvalue per share of Univar Solutions common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value for the Company as of\nDecember 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative next twelve month (\u201cNTM\u201d) enterprise value to\nEBITDA (\u201cNTM EV / EBITDA\u201d) of 7.0x to 9.0x to estimates of the Company\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2024 to\n2026 reflected in the Univar Standalone Projections. This illustrative range of NTM EV / EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs\nutilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / EBITDA multiples for the Company.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of the Company\u2019s net debt for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025, each as provided by and approved\nfor Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity\nvalues as of December 31 for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2023 to 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the\nprojected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock for each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025, calculated using\ninformation provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, to derive a range of implied future values per share\nof Univar Solutions common stock. Goldman Sachs then added the cumulative dividends per share of Univar Solutions common stock expected to be\npaid to holders of Univar Solutions common stock through the end of each of fiscal years 2023 to 2025, using estimates provided by Company\nmanagement. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future equity values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to December 31, 2022,\nusing an illustrative discount rate of 11.5%, reflecting an estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by\napplication of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $30.36 to $48.90 per share of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock. Goldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share\nof Univar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock\nas of November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.\nSelected Transactions Analysis \nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions (which we refer to as the \u201cGoldman Sachs Selected\nTransactions\u201d) in the chemical distribution industry and in other industries since 2010. For each of the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions, Goldman\nSachs calculated and compared the implied transaction value (which we refer to as \u201cTV\u201d) of the applicable transaction based on the consideration paid in\nthe transaction for the applicable target company as a multiple of the target company\u2019s LTM adjusted EBITDA based on information in public filings,\npress releases and investor relations documents. While none of the businesses that participated in the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions are directly\ncomparable to the Company, the businesses that participated in the Goldman Sachs Selected Transactions are businesses with operations that, for the\npurposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company\u2019s results, market sizes and product profile.\n \n-57-\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\n \nAnnouncement Date\nGoldman Sachs Selected Transactions\nTV /LTM Adj.\nEBITDA\nAcquiror\nTarget\nAugust 2022\nHIG Capital LLC\nAvient Corporation\u2019s\nDistribution business\nsegment\n10.0x\nSeptember 2018\nUnivar Inc.\nNexeo Solutions, Inc.\n9.7x\nMarch 2016\nWL Ross Holding Corp.\nNexeo Solutions\nHoldings, LLC\n8.3x\nMay 2015\nApax Partners LLP\nQuality Distribution,\nInc.\n9.1x\nJuly 2012\nOlin Corporation\nK.A.

Goldman Sachs\nthen subtracted the net debt of the Company as of (i) December 31, 2022 and (ii) December 31, 2022 excluding cash in connection with the Company\u2019s two\nacquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 respectively, each as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of\nthe Company, and divided each respective result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock as of December 31,\n2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, calculated using information provided by and approved\nfor Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, to derive reference ranges of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\n \nReference Ranges of Implied Values Per Share of Univar Solutions Common Stock\nNormalized 2022A Adj. EBITDA\n2023E Adj. EBITDA\n$33.77 - $46.57\n$34.75 - $48.09\nGoldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of\nUnivar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as\nof November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.\nPremia Paid Analysis \nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions announced\nfrom January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2022 involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed transaction\nvalues were between $5 billion\n \n-58-\nTable of Contents\nand $10 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile\npremiums of the price paid in the 65 transactions relative to the target\u2019s VWAP for the 30-trading day period prior to announcement of the transaction.\nThis analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 21% and 75th percentile\npremium of 49% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 21% to 49% to the volume-\nweighted average price per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $27.04 for the 30-trading day period ended November 22, 2022 and calculated a\nrange of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock of $32.75 to $40.24.\nGoldman Sachs compared this range of implied values per share of Univar Solutions common stock to the closing price of $32.09 per share of\nUnivar Solutions common stock on March 10, 2023, the 30-day volume-weighted average price of $27.04 per share of Univar Solutions common stock as\nof November 22, 2022, and the Merger Consideration of $36.15 in cash per share of Univar Solutions common stock.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could, Goldman Sachs believes, create an\nincomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of\nall of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as\nto fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in\nthe above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company, Parent, or the contemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board of Directors that the $36.15 in cash per\nshare of Univar Solutions common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Univar Solutions common stock. These analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future\nresults are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.\nBecause these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their\nrespective advisors, none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those\nforecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations by the Company and was approved by the Board of Directors.\nGoldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of\nconsideration to the Company or the Board of Directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate Merger\nConsideration for the Merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors\nin making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs\nattached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending, and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,\ninvestment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates\nand employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at\nany time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default\nswaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of\n \n-59-\nTable of Contents\ntheir respective affiliates and third parties, including Apollo and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, each of which is (or will become before or at\nClosing) a significant indirect shareholder of Parent, and any of their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio or investee companies, or any\ncurrency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the\nCompany in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.

Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion did not address the prices\nat which any securities will trade at any time.\nIn connection with its role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available\nfinancial and other information concerning the Company and the\n \n-61-\nTable of Contents\nUnivar Standalone Projections, including, at the Board of Directors\u2019 direction, certain sensitivities to the profitability and volume assumptions used in\ndeveloping the Univar Standalone Projections.

Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, assumed and relied\nupon the accuracy and completeness of all such information.

In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no\nview as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion was necessarily\nbased upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Deutsche Bank\nexpressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it becomes\naware after the date of its opinion.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, that in all respects\nmaterial to its analysis, the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or\namendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to its analysis.

Some of the\nsummaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the analyses, the tables must\n \n-63-\nTable of Contents\nbe read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of Deutsche Bank\u2019s analyses. Considering the\ndata described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions\nunderlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information,\nto the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 10, 2023, and is not necessarily indicative of current\nmarket conditions.\nIn preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things (i) EV, calculated as equity value plus net debt, and in the case\nof the Company, plus the aggregate expected purchase price in connection with the Company\u2019s two acquisitions announced in the first quarter of 2023 in\nsome instances identified below where implied EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiples are presented on a pro forma basis for the Company\u2019s two acquisitions\nannounced in the first quarter of 2023\u037e (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization calculated as the sum of consolidated net income,\ndepreciation, amortization, net interest expense and income tax expense (which we refer to as \u201cEBITDA\u201d)\u037e (iii) EBITDA excluding from net income the\nimpact of impairment charges, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consist of employee stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring\ncharges, litigation settlements, other employee severance costs, other facility closure costs, acquisition and integration related expenses and other\nunusual or nonrecurring expenses), and other income or expenses, net (which consist of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and\nundesignated derivative instruments, non-operating retirement benefits and other non-operating activity) (which we refer to as \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d)\u037e (iv)\nAdjusted EBITDA plus and/or minus other unusual or nonrecurring items, including non-repeating pricing benefits and bonuses over 100% target as\nestimated by management of the Company (which we refer to as \u201cNormalized Adjusted EBITDA\u201d)\u037e (v) Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to include the EBITDA\nacquired in connection with the Company\u2019s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023\u037e and (vi) delivered gross profit, calculated as\ngross profit (exclusive of depreciation) less outbound freight and handling (which we refer to as \u201cDGP\u201d).

        "Section Text": "Certain Financial Projections\nWhile Univar Solutions has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, including a set of high level, three-year financial\ntargets that were based on Univar Solutions\u2019 draft strategic plan on Univar Solutions\u2019 November 2, 2022 earnings call, Univar Solutions has not, as a\nmatter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the then current annual\nperiod due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty,\nunpredictability and subjectivity of underlying assumptions and estimates. In the ordinary course, however, Univar Solutions\u2019 management prepares a\nfive year long range strategic plan, which is updated annually and reviewed with the Board of Directors, that reflects Univar Solutions\u2019 potential financial\nand business outlook for Univar Solutions generally over a five-year period.\nIn connection with the proposed Merger, Univar Solutions is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective\nfinancial information of Univar Solutions, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by Univar Solutions\u2019 management, solely\nbecause, as described below, certain financial information was reviewed by the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration and evaluation of\nthe Merger and given to each of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank for their use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by\nGoldman Sachs to the Board of Directors and Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of\nGoldman Sachs\u201d and the financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors and Deutsche Bank\u2019s opinion as discussed in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of Deutsche Bank\u201d.\nAs part of Univar Solutions\u2019 annual business review, Univar Solutions\u2019 management prepared and reviewed with the Board of Directors, at its\nOctober 27, 2022 meeting, Univar Solutions\u2019 draft long range strategic plan for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 (which we refer to as the \u201cUnivar LRSP\u201d),\nwhich included a financial forecast that was based on and reflected, among other things, assumptions regarding industry performance, general business,\neconomic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as assumptions\n \n-70-Table of Contents\nspecific to Univar Solutions\u2019 business, including expected sales growth, costs, profitability, and cash generation, all of which are difficult to predict and\nmany of which are beyond Univar Solutions\u2019 control. The Univar LRSP reviewed with the Board of Directors at its October 27, 2022 meeting was subject\nto finalization by Univar Solutions\u2019 management in the ordinary course of Univar Solutions\u2019 business.\nAt its November 16, 2022 special meeting, the Board of Directors further reviewed and discussed the Univar LRSP and directed Goldman Sachs and\nDeutsche Bank to utilize the Univar LRSP for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 once it had been finalized by the management of Univar Solutions (which we\nrefer to as the \u201cUnivar Standalone Projections\u201d) in preparing their financial analysis with respect to Univar Solutions and any potential transaction,\nincluding for any fairness opinions to be rendered. Additionally, the management of Univar Solutions provided a copy of the Univar LRSP to Goldman\nSachs and Deutsche Bank for their use in its preliminary financial analysis of Univar Solutions that was presented to the Board of Directors at the\nNovember 20, 2022 special meeting.\nFollowing the November 16, 2022 special meeting of the Board of Directors, Univar Solutions\u2019 management finalized the long range strategic plan\nfor fiscal years 2023 through 2027. The Univar LRSP was revised to reflect certain updates to the Univar LRSP with regards to the 2023 Annual Operating\nPlan, including the Company\u2019s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 and the associated synergies and costs to achieve synergies.\nThe Univar Standalone Projections similarly involved assumptions regarding, among other things, industry performance, general business, economic,\nregulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as assumptions specific to Univar Solutions\u2019 business, including expected\nsales growth, costs, profitability, and cash generation, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Univar Solutions\u2019 control. The\nUnivar Standalone Projections were provided to the Board of Directors, and were provided by representatives of Univar Solutions to representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank on January 12, 2023. A copy of the Univar Standalone Projections was provided to Apollo, Platinum Falcon and their\nrepresentatives following execution of a confidentiality agreement with Univar Solutions, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014\nBackground of the Merger.\u201d \nThe Univar LRSP and the Univar Standalone Projections are collectively referred to as the \u201cCompany Plans.\u201d The Company Plans were prepared\ntreating Univar Solutions on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger,\nthe expenses that may be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction or the consummation thereof, the effect of any business or strategic\ndecision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed or in anticipation of the proposed transaction,\nor the effect of any alteration, acceleration, postponement or decision not to take any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have\nbeen taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the\nMerger.\nUnivar Solutions and its representatives advised the recipients of the Company Plans that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in many\nrespects. The inclusion of the Company Plans or of this summary does not constitute an admission or representation by Univar Solutions, Goldman\nSachs, Deutsche Bank or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Goldman\nSachs, Deutsche Bank, Univar Solutions or its management, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance\nof the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and\nshould not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the\nCompany Plans.\nThe Company Plans and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Plans were based are subjective in many respects and subject to\nmultiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of Univar Solutions\u2019 industry and based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The Company Plans, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to\n \n-71-\nTable of Contents\nCompany performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which\nare difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond Univar Solutions\u2019 control. The Company Plans\nconstitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d that could cause the Company Plans or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and\nfor actual results to differ materially from the Company Plans. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company Plans will be realized or that actual\nresults will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and the Company Plans cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and\nshould not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Plans cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each\nsuccessive year. The Company Plans do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared,\nincluding the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the Company Plans may have\nchanged since the date the Company Plans were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional\nsignificant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Plans will be achieved.\nIn addition, the Company Plans have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Company Plans were prepared\nor as of the date of this proxy statement. None of Univar Solutions, Apollo, Platinum Falcon or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and\neach of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Plans or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances\nexisting after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in\nerror (except, in the case of Univar Solutions, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing\nthe Company Plans, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held more than four months after the Company Plans were prepared, as\nwell as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting assumptions/information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted\nreliance on the Company Plans set forth below. The Company Plans should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements\nand other information contained in Univar Solutions\u2019 public filings with the SEC. Univar Solutions urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent\nSEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation\u201d for additional information.\nThe Company Plans were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (which we\nrefer to as \u201cE&Y\u201d), Univar Solutions\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed\nany procedures with respect to the Company Plans and, accordingly, neither E&Y nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form\nof assurance with respect thereto. The E&Y report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Univar Solutions\u2019 historical financial\ninformation. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.\nThe Company Plans contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Univar Solutions believes are helpful in understanding its past financial\nperformance and future results. Univar Solutions management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for\nforecasting, budgeting and measuring financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Univar Solutions believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to\nhelp investors understand the operating results and to analyze Univar Solutions\u2019 financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis, there are\nlimitations\n \n-72-\nTable of Contents\nassociated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not\nreported by all of Univar Solutions\u2019 competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Univar Solutions\u2019 competitors due to\npotential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of an adjusted financial measure to a\nGAAP financial measure do not apply to adjusted financial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed\nbusiness combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of adjusted\nfinancial measures were not relied upon by the Board of Directors or the members of management or financial advisors in connection with their respective\nevaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Univar Solutions has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Company\nPlans to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nUnivar Solutions has not made and makes no representation to any Univar Solutions stockholder or to Apollo, the Abu Dhabi Investment\nAuthority, Parent, Merger Sub, the Apollo Funds or Platinum Falcon in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company Plans or regarding\nUnivar Solutions\u2019 ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Company Plans or that the projected results will be achieved.\nUnivar LRSP\nSubject to the foregoing qualifications, the following table presents a summary of the Univar LRSP.\n$ in millions\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\nNet Sales\n$ 11,005\n$ 11,420\n$ 12,027\n$\n12,603\n$\n13,228\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n930\n$\n1,025\n$\n1,125\n$\n1,235\n$\n1,326\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$\n492\n$\n537\n$\n573\n$\n650\n$\n690\n \n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) excluding\nfrom net income the impact of impairment charges, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consist of employee stock-based compensation\nexpenses, restructuring charges, litigation settlements, other employee severance costs, other facility closure costs, acquisition and integration\nrelated expenses and other unusual or nonrecurring expenses), and other income or expenses, net (which consist of gains and losses on foreign\ncurrency transactions and undesignated derivative instruments, non-operating retirement benefits and other non-operating activity).\n(2)\nUnlevered free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated as (a) Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization and stock\ncompensation expense, less (b) cash taxes, plus (c) depreciation and amortization, less (d) capital expenditures, plus or less (e) change in net\nworking capital, less (f) other costs, including pension payments, below the line expenses and change in other assets and liabilities.\nUnivar Standalone Projections\nSubject to the foregoing qualifications, the following table presents a summary of the Univar Standalone Projections.\n$ in millions\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\nNet Sales\n$ 11,360\n$ 11,635\n$ 12,228\n$\n12,823\n$\n13,463\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n945\n$\n1,049\n$\n1,152\n$\n1,265\n$\n1,357\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(2)\n$\n496\n$\n526\n$\n568\n$\n651\n$\n703\n \n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) adjusted to\ninclude the net realizable Adjusted EBITDA acquired in\n \n-73-\nTable of Contents\nconnection with the Company\u2019s two acquisitions announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 (including the synergies, and cost to achieve such\nsynergies, associated therewith), excluding from net income the impact of impairment charges, other operating expenses, net (which primarily\nconsist of employee stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, litigation settlements, other employee severance costs, other\nfacility closure costs, acquisition and integration related expenses and other unusual or nonrecurring expenses), and other income or expenses, net\n(which consist of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and undesignated derivative instruments, non-operating retirement benefits\nand other non-operating activity).\n(2)\nUnlevered free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated as (a) Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization and stock\ncompensation expense, plus the net realizable Adjusted EBITDA acquired in connection the Company\u2019s two acquisitions announced in the first\nfiscal quarter of 2023 (including the synergies, and cost to achieve such synergies, associated therewith), less (b) cash taxes, plus (c) depreciation\nand amortization, less (d) capital expenditures, plus or less (e) change in net working capital, less (f) other costs, including pension payments,\nbelow the line expenses and change in other assets and liabilities.\nInterests of Univar Solutions\u2019 Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Univar Solutions stockholders approve the transaction and vote in favor of the\nMerger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, Univar Solutions stockholders should be aware that the\nexecutive officers and directors of Univar Solutions have certain interests in the Merger and transactions contemplated thereby that are or may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of Univar Solutions stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and\nconsidered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and in making\ntheir recommendation that Univar Solutions stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of\nthem, including compensation that may become payable in connection with the Merger to named executive officers, which is the subject of a nonbinding,\nadvisory vote of Univar Solutions stockholders, are quantified in the narrative below. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cProposal 2: The Compensation Proposal.\u201d The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only\nand do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, the named executive officers of Univar Solutions are:\n \n\u2022\nDavid C. Jukes, President and Chief Executive Officer\n \n\u2022\nNicholas W. Alexos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n \n\u2022\nNicholas Powell, Senior Vice President, President of Europe, Middle East and Africa & Asia Pacific and Ingredients & Specialties\n \n\u2022\nJames B. Holcomb, Senior Vice President, President of North America and Chemicals & Services\n \n\u2022\nNoelle J. Perkins, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Chief Risk Officer\nFor purposes of this disclosure, \u201cqualifying termination\u201d means a termination of employment by Univar Solutions without cause or by the\napplicable executive officer for good reason (each term as defined in the relevant agreement).\nTreatment of Univar Solutions Equity Awards\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award, Univar Solutions PRSU Award, Univar Solutions RSU Award,\nUnivar Solutions DSU Award and Univar Solutions Option will be cashed out based on the Merger Consideration, less any required tax withholding and\ndeductions and less the applicable\n \n-74-\nTable of Contents\nper share exercise price in the case of a Univar Solutions Option, with the number of Univar Solutions shares covered by each Univar Solutions PRSU\nAward equal to: (A) for each such award granted in 2021, the greater of (i) 170% of the target number of shares covered by the award and (ii) the number\nof shares covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through the period ending on the last day of the calendar month\nimmediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs, (B) for each such award granted in 2022, the greater of (i) 150% of the target\nnumber of shares covered by the award and (ii) the number of shares covered by the award based on the actual level of performance achieved through\nthe period ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month in which the Effective Time occurs and (C) for each\nsuch award granted on or following January 1, 2023, the target number of shares covered by such award. For an estimate of the value of unvested equity\nawards that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on April 28, 2023, and each of the named executive officers experiences a qualifying termination\non that date, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions\u2019 Named Executive Officers\u201d below. We estimate that the value of\nunvested equity awards held by all executive officers, other than the named executive officers, that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs\non April 28, 2023, and all such executive officers experience qualifying terminations on that date is $6,089,395. We estimate that the aggregate value of\nunvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Univar Solutions that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on April 28, 2023 is\n$1,673,745.\nExecutive Severance Arrangements\nMessrs. Jukes, Powell, Alexos and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins\nUnivar Solutions is party to severance and change in control agreements with each of Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms.\nPerkins. Pursuant to the agreements, if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination during the period beginning three months before\nand ending 24 months (18 months for Messrs. Alexos and Powell) following a change in control, the named executive officer will be entitled to:\n(1) a lump sum cash payment equal to a multiple (2.5x for Mr. Jukes and 2.0x for Messrs. Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins) of the sum\nof the named executive officer\u2019s annual base salary and target bonus for the year in which the named executive officer\u2019s employment terminates or the\nyear in which the Effective Time occurs, if greater\u037e\n(2) Except for Mr. Powell, a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination assuming achievement of target performance (or, for Mr. Alexos, based upon\nactual achievement), based on the annual bonus target for the year in which the named executive officer\u2019s employment terminates or the year in which the\nEffective Time occurs, if greater\u037e and\n(3) Except for Messrs. Powell and Alexos, up to 18 months of COBRA health care continuation coverage in the form of premium reimbursements for\nthe named executive officer and, if applicable, his or her spouse and dependents.\nThe foregoing payments are conditional upon Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Powell and Holcomb and Ms. Perkins executing and not revoking a release of\nclaims agreement with Univar Solutions. Each of Messrs. Jukes, Alexos, Holcomb and Powell and Ms. Perkins are prohibited for a period of 18 months (12\nmonths in the case of Mr. Alexos) following termination of employment from competing with Univar Solutions and soliciting Univar Solutions\u2019 employees,\ncustomers and suppliers. Mr. Powell is also party to a garden leave letter which provides that Mr. Powell is entitled to 12 months\u2019 notice of termination of\nemployment, or, in the event such notice is not given, payment of his base salary for such period.\nOther Executive Officers\nUnivar Solutions is also party to severance and change in control agreements with three of Univar Solutions\u2019 executive officers who are not named\nexecutive officers. Subject to executing and not revoking a\n \n-75-\nTable of Contents\nrelease of claims agreement with Univar Solutions, each of the three executive officers is entitled to the same benefits as each of Mr. Holcomb and Ms.\nPerkins, except that one of the three executive officers is not entitled to COBRA health care continuation coverage but is entitled to receive a specified\ncontribution to a severance indemnity fund. Each of the three executive officers is also prohibited for a period of 18 months following termination of\nemployment from soliciting Univar Solutions\u2019 employees, customers and suppliers, and each is, in a separate agreement, prohibited from competing with\nUnivar Solutions for the same period following termination.\nFor an estimate of the value of the severance payments described above that would be payable to Univar Solutions\u2019 named executive officers upon\na qualifying termination on April 28, 2023, see \u201c\u2014Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions\u2019 Named Executive Officers\u201d below. We\nestimate that the aggregate value of severance payments that would be payable to the three Univar Solutions executive officers who are not named\nexecutive officers, assuming a qualifying termination on April 28, 2023, is $4,622,630.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Univar Solutions\u2019 directors and officers will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies. This indemnification and\ninsurance coverage is further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d \nNew Compensation Arrangements\nAny executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to the\nSurviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit\nplans maintained by Parent, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation arrangements\nbetween such persons and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been established or discussed.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to Univar Solutions\u2019 Named Executive Officers\nThe table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Univar Solutions\u2019 named executive officers would receive in\nconnection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination\non April 28, 2023 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure)\u037e (ii) a per share price of Univar\nSolutions common stock of $36.15\u037e (iii) that each named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in\neffect as of the date of this proxy statement\u037e and (iv) the Univar Solutions Restricted Share Award, Univar Solutions PRSU Award, Univar Solutions RSU\nAward, Univar Solutions DSU Award and Univar Solutions Option (which together we refer to as the \u201cUnivar Solutions Equity Awards\u201d) are outstanding\nas of April 28, 2023. The calculations in the table below do not include any amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were\nvested as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the\nEffective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to April 28, 2023. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which\nmay or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts,\nif any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\n \n-76-\nTable of Contents\nGolden Parachute Compensation\n \nNamed Executive Officer\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity\nAwards ($)(2)\nBenefits ($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nDavid Jukes\n$\n6,790,000\n$\n20,099,002\n$\n31,072\n$\n26,920,074\nNicholas W.

        "Section Header": "Appraisal Rights",
        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nThis section summarizes Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. The following discussion is not a complete\nstatement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may\nbe accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that\nyou exercise your appraisal rights under Section 262.\nAny person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of Section 262, which may be accessed\nwithout subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262), particularly the\nprocedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and perfecting\nappraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a (i) \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record\nholder of Univar Solutions common stock, (ii) \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock\nheld either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) \u201cperson\u201d are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated\nassociation or other entity.\nUnder Section 262, stockholders and beneficial owners desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1) properly deliver a written demand for an\nappraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock to Univar Solutions prior to the stockholder vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n(2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (3) hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of\nUnivar Solutions common stock upon the making of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, such shares of\nUnivar Solutions common stock through the Effective Time\u037e (4) not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their\nappraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (5) otherwise meet the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262.\nHowever, assuming the shares of Univar Solutions common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which\nwe expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all\nstockholders and beneficial owners of Univar Solutions common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares\nof Univar Solutions common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%\n \n-79-Table of Contents\nof the outstanding shares of Univar Solutions common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cMinimum Conditions.\u201d\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including\nany surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e\nprovided, however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may\npay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount\nthat equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair\nvalue of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration offered\npursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less\nthan 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing\nthe stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement\nconstitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed without\nsubscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In connection with the\nMerger, any person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such person\u2019s right to do so should review Section 262 carefully.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person\nwho loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for\nexercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock must\nstrictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The\nSurviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,\na stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding\nmethods of voting.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger will, in and of itself, constitute a\nwritten demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must\n \n-80-\nTable of Contents\nbe in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s failure to make the\nwritten demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting may constitute a waiver of appraisal\nrights.\nRecord Holders\nA demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the\nidentity of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If a\nholder of record is submitting a demand with respect to shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one\nperson, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including\nan authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify\nthe record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of\nrecord, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Univar Solutions common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or\nmore beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Univar Solutions common stock held for one or more beneficial owners\nwhile not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Univar Solutions common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be\npresumed to cover all shares of Univar Solutions common stock held in the name of the holder of record.\nBeneficial Owners\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares in accordance with the procedures\nof subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time\nand otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand made by\nsuch beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of\nsuch beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to\nbe, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Univar Solutions under Section 262 and to be set forth\non the Verified List. Although not expressly required by Section 262, Univar Solutions reserves the right to take the position that it may require the\nsubmission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 with respect to any person sharing beneficial\nownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: Secretary, Univar Solutions Inc., 3075 Highland\nParkway, Suite 200, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic transmission.\nActions After Completion of the Merger\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Univar Solutions common\nstock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,\nand any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal as of the Effective Time, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date\nthereof.\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s\n \n-81-\nTable of Contents\ndemand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nwith respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to us as the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal\nrights under Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nSurviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the fair value of the\nshares held by all our stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition,\nand no person should assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of\nUnivar Solutions common stock. Accordingly, any stockholders or beneficial owners who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all\nnecessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed\nin Section 262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock to file such a petition within the period\nspecified in Section 262 could result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon\nwritten request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial\nowners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such\nshares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must\ngive this statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10\ndays after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of Univar Solutions common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is\nserved upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware\nRegister in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded\nappraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all\nof the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to\ndetermine those persons who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may\ndismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nIn addition, assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the\nMinimum Conditions is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value\n \n-82-\nTable of Contents\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value\n(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262\nof the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as described above).\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court\nof Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered,\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,\nin making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise\nand any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262\nprovides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d\nbut which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of\nDelaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares of Univar Solutions common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner\naddress, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is\nfair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering\nexercising appraisal rights should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nMerger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither Univar Solutions nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock exercising\nappraisal rights, and Univar Solutions and Parent each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Univar Solutions common stock is\nless than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not\ntimely filed, neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an\nappraisal will cease.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person\nwhose name appears on the Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal\nrights under Section 262.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation\nto the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\n \n-83-\nTable of Contents\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of\na person whose name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or subject to\nsuch an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own\nexpenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Univar Solutions common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or\nsuccessfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of Univar Solutions common stock will be deemed to have been converted\nat the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest. A person will fail to\nperfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, neither\nof the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in accordance with\nSection 262 of the DGCL.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares of Univar\nSolutions common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares,\nexcept dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if\nneither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Univar Solutions common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately\nprior to the Effective Time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares within 60 days after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262, then the\nright of such person to an appraisal of such shares will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, no\nappraisal proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the\nDelaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262\u037e provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand in respect of some or all of such\nperson\u2019s shares and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within 60 days after the Effective\nTime.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel\nbefore attempting to exercise those rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as\ndefined below) of shares of Univar Solutions common stock whose shares of Univar Solutions common stock are converted into the right to receive cash\npursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Univar Solutions common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the \u201cCode\u201d) (generally, property held for\ninvestment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. Holders. This discussion is\nbased upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which\nwe refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and\nconclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary\nto any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has\nbeen or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions common stock that is for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes:\n \n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any\nstate thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n \n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source\u037e or\n \n\u2022\na trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more\n\u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust\nvalidly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to Univar Solutions stockholders subject\nto special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:\n \n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n \n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n \n\u2022\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n \n-85-Table of Contents\n\u2022\ndealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Univar Solutions common stock\u037e\n \n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n \n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n \n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that hold shares of Univar Solutions common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction\nor conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n \n\u2022\npartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS corporations,\u201d or any other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Univar Solutions common stock (by vote or value)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of Univar Solutions common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-qualified retirement plan\nor pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncontrolled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax\u037e\n \n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders subject to any applicable minimum tax\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL\u037e and\n \n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Univar Solutions common stock as a result of\nsuch income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other\nnon-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any\nconsiderations arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or any\nconsiderations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance\npromulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or\npractices adopted in connection with any such agreement).\nIf any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of shares of Univar Solutions\ncommon stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of\nthe partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships\nholding shares of Univar Solutions common stock, and any partners therein, should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to\nthem of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR UNIVAR\nSOLUTIONS STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE UNIVAR SOLUTIONS STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU\nSHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF\nYOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX\nCONSEQUENCES.\n \n-86-\nTable of Contents\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Univar Solutions common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Univar Solutions\ncommon stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the\nMerger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Univar Solutions common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Univar Solutions common stock. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or\nloss on the disposition of shares of Univar Solutions common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will\ngenerally be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the\nMerger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential\nrates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Univar Solutions common stock at different\ntimes or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Univar\nSolutions common stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nthe U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct\ntaxpayer identification number and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and\notherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a\ncredit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL CHANGES TO OR\nINTERPRETATIONS OF CURRENT LAW, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET\nFORTH HEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nTHAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME\nTAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nEach of Parent and the Company has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to\ntake promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with one another in doing, all things\nnecessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances,\napprovals, and expirations or terminations or waiting periods from governmental entities as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement \u2014  Regulatory Efforts and Related Matters.\u201d These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act, CFIUS Approval, and certain\nspecific other filings and related approvals under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of other jurisdictions as described further below.\n \n-87-Table of Contents\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances \nThe Merger is subject to the HSR Act. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or termination of a 30-\nday waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or the DOJ issues a Second Request prior to the\nexpiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have\nsubstantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.\nThe parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 27, 2023, and the initial 30-day waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time\non April 26, 2023.\nAt any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act,\nthe FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin\nthe completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under\nthe antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or\nseeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nIn addition, the Merger is conditioned on CFIUS Approval. The parties submitted a draft notice to CFIUS on March 30, 2023 and a formal notice on\nApril 24, 2023.\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nIn addition to HSR clearance and CFIUS Approval, the Merger is also subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions\nunder their applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws.

the\nperiod following delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Board of Directors concludes in good faith after consultation with its\noutside legal and financial advisors that the Alternative Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a\nSuperior Proposal (provided that any material modifications or amendments to the terms of such Alternative Proposal will commence a new\nnotice period of two business days).\nPrior to obtaining the Univar Solutions Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in this\nsection below) make a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,\nthat the failure of the Board of Directors to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself will not be deemed a Change of Recommendation), so long as:\n \n\u2022\nUnivar Solutions has given Parent at least three business days\u2019 written notice (which we refer to as an \u201cIntervening

failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of\nRecommendation would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law\n(provided that any material changes relating to such Intervening Event will commence a new notice period two business days).\nNothing contained in the Merger Agreement will prevent Univar Solutions or its Board of Directors from (i) taking or disclosing to its stockholders\na position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a \u201cstop, look\nand listen\u201d statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in\ngood faith, after consultation with Univar Solutions\u2019 outside legal counsel, that such disclosure would be required under applicable law, and no such\ndisclosure or communication will be considered a Change of Recommendation or require the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event\nNotice. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a factually accurate required public statement by Univar Solutions or the Board of Directors (or a\ncommittee thereof) that describes the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the identity of the person or group making such Alternative Proposal, the\nmaterial terms of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding,\nwithdrawal, amendment, qualification, or modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend,\nqualify or modify, the Recommendation\u037e (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Alternative Proposal\u037e or (C) a Change of\nRecommendation.\nAfter delivery of any written notice pursuant to the provision described in this section and during the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent Parent\ndesires to engage in good faith negotiations, Univar Solutions will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours of any material development) keep Parent\ninformed of all material developments affecting any such Intervening Event or Change of Recommendation.\nAn \u201cIntervening Event\u201d is defined as any event, change, occurrence or development that is material and that (i) is unknown and not reasonably\nforeseeable to the Board of Directors (or any member thereof) as of March 13, 2023, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or\nany member thereof) as March 13, 2023, the consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or any member\nthereof) as of March 13, 2023, and (ii) does not involve or relate to any Alternative Proposal. In no event will the following events, changes, occurrences\nor developments, in and of themselves, constitute an Intervening Event: (x) the receipt, existence of or terms of any Alternative Proposal or (y) any\nchange in the price or trading volume of the shares or any other securities of Univar Solutions or its subsidiaries (provided that the underlying causes of\nsuch changes may constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event).",
