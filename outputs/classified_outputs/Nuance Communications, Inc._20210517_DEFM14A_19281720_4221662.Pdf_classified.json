        "Section Text": "Treatment of Equity Compensation (page 49)\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the\nform of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold restricted stock units, which we refer to as RSUs,\nand performance stock units, which we refer to as PSUs, and our non-employee directors hold RSUs and deferred\nstock units, which we refer to as DSUs. Our executive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options.\nThe merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:\nStock Options\nEach stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock\nthat would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable\nwithholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the\noption will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.\nStock Units\n\u2022\nEach award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will\nbecome vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the\noccurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n5TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nEach outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a\nstock-based award of Microsoft, which we refer to as a Rollover RSU, as follows:\n\u25cb\nEach RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting\nschedule as the RSU.\n\u25cb\nEach PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based\nsolely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.\n\u25cb\nThe number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the\nproduct (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock\nsubject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a\nspecified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of common stock subject to each\nPSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum performance, for\nany PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and (ii) target\nperformance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals. For each\nPSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently\nperforming at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would\nnot result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This\ncompensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity\naward, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts 0.00005 and above rounded\nup) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the last\ntrading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the terms of Nuance\u2019s Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer\nto as the ESPP, no ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16, 2021, may increase his\nor her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new participants may enroll in the\ncurrent offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will take all actions necessary to\nprovide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

These questions and answers may not address all questions that may\nbe important to you as a Nuance stockholder. We encourage you to read carefully the more detailed information\ncontained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement (including the merger agreement),\nand the documents we incorporate by reference in this proxy statement. You may obtain the documents and\ninformation incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the\nsection entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 87. The merger agreement is attached as\nAnnex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these proxy materials?\nA:\nOn April 11, 2021, Nuance entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Sub, with and into\nNuance, with Nuance surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. In order to complete the\nmerger, Nuance stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the\nrequisite number of shares of Nuance common stock and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement have been satisfied or waived, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with Nuance continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Nuance will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft\nand you will no longer own shares of Nuance common stock. Nuance expects to delist its common stock from\nNasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common stock under the Exchange\nAct as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a publicly traded\ncompany.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $56.00 in\ncash, without interest and less applicable tax withholdings, for each share of Nuance common stock that you\nown, unless you have properly exercised and perfected and not withdrawn your demand for, or\n1\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\notherwise lost your, appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100\nshares of Nuance common stock, you will receive $5,600.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, in exchange for your shares of Nuance common stock. In no case will you own shares in the\nsurviving corporation.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nIf your shares of Nuance common stock are registered in your name in the records of our transfer agent,\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, which we refer to as AST, as of the close of business on the\nrecord date, you are a \u201cstockholder of record\u201d for purposes of the special meeting and are eligible to attend and\nvote.

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting\ninstruction forms provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nHow do I vote my shares?\nA:\nFor stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the special meeting and are a stockholder of record, you\nmay submit your proxy or cast your vote in any of four ways:\n\u2022\nBy Internet - If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions\nprovided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via Internet must be received\nby 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.\n\u2022\nBy Telephone - You can also submit your proxy by telephone by following the instructions provided with\nyour proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via telephone must be received by 11:59\np.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021.\n\u2022\nBy Mail - You may submit your proxy by completing the proxy card enclosed with those materials, signing\nand dating it and returning it in the prepaid envelope we have provided.\n\u2022\nBy Virtual Ballot - You may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting\nwebsite and complete a virtual ballot.\nFor holders in street name: If you hold your shares in street name and, therefore, are not a stockholder of\nrecord, you will need to follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other\nsimilar institution. If you wish to vote your shares by virtual ballot at our special meeting, you must obtain a\nvalid proxy from your broker, bank or similar institution, granting you authorization to vote your shares.\nIf you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your\nshares of Nuance common stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.\nEven if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of\nNuance common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid proxy to vote shares\nwhich you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Nuance common stock by virtual ballot at the\nspecial meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote\nby virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.\nQ:\nCan I change or revoke my proxy?\nA:\nFor stockholders of record: Yes. A proxy may be changed or revoked at any time prior to the vote at the special\nmeeting by submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy submitted via the Internet or by telephone) or by\ngiving written notice to our Secretary at our principal executive offices. You may not change your vote over the\nInternet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 14, 2021. You may also attend the special meeting\nand vote your shares by virtual ballot.\nFor holders in street name: Yes. You must follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your\nbroker, bank or other similar institution to change or revoke any instructions you have already provided to them.\nQ:\nHow will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific instructions in the proxy card or voting instructions\nform that I submit?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record and if you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not provide specific\nvoting instructions, your shares of Nuance common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe merger-related compensation proposal.\nIf your shares are held in street name at a broker, bank or similar institution, your broker, bank or similar\ninstitution may under certain circumstances vote your shares on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters if you do not timely\nprovide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions provided by them. However, if you do not\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprovide timely instructions, your broker, bank or similar institution does not have the authority to vote on any\n\u201cnon-discretionary\u201d proposals at the special meeting and a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d would occur, as explained in the\nfollowing question and explanation.\nQ:\nWhat is \u201cbroker discretionary voting\u201d?\nA:\nIf you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other similar institution may be able to vote your\nshares without your instructions depending on whether the matter being voted on is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d or \u201cnon-\ndiscretionary.\u201d Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting\nauthority with respect to any of the two proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares of Nuance common stock held\nin street name does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to any of the\nproposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If\nthere are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nmerger proposal, but will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal. Therefore, it is\nimportant that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the special meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special\nmeeting, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting. As of the close of\nbusiness on May 14, 2021, there were 286,094,629 shares of Nuance common stock issued and outstanding and\nentitled to vote. We expect that a similar number of shares of Nuance common stock will be issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting as of the close of business on the record date. If you\nsubmit a properly executed proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum.\nIn addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be\ncounted for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be\nadjourned by the chairman of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Nuance\u2019s bylaws until a quorum\nis obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the annual meeting?\nA:\nThe merger proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Nuance common stock outstanding and\nentitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger proposal. This means that the proposal will be\napproved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the\nvotes that can be cast in respect of our outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe merger-related compensation proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares\nof Nuance common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, and voting at the special\nmeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the\nmerger-related compensation proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares\nvoted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of the shares of Nuance common stock entitled to vote which\nare present, in person or by proxy, and vote at the special meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions\nand broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain a proxy card or voting instruction form?\nA:\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card or a voting instruction form, please follow the\napplicable procedure below.\nFor stockholders of record: Please contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at (877) 750-0854\nfrom the U.S. or Canada, or at +1 (412) 232-3651 from other locations.\nFor holders in street name: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar\ninstitution.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become\npayable by Nuance to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require Nuance to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?\nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by Nuance to our named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Nuance\u2019s\nnamed executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in nature.\nCompensation that will or may become payable by Microsoft to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cProposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger-Related Executive\nCompensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 77.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, under the terms of the merger agreement, you will receive shortly thereafter\nthe letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to\nthe paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration for each share of your\nNuance common stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry shares. You should use the letter of\ntransmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon completion\nof the merger. Please do not send in your stock certificates now.\nQ:\nI do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the merger consideration for my shares of Nuance\ncommon stock?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will\ninclude the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This will include an\naffidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to\npost a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on\nthe record date but before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be\ncompleted. If you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record\ndate but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the provision of a proxy) are made\nbetween you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies\nNuance in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger\nconsideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Nuance\ncommon stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or\notherwise transfer your shares of Nuance common stock after the close of business on the record date, we\nencourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and currently intend to complete the\nmerger during this calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted\nbecause the completion of the merger is subject to conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement\nby our stockholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead,\nNuance will remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded\non Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the\nSEC.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee upon the\ntermination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement -\nTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 75.\nQ:\nAre there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?\nA:\nYes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See the section entitled\n\u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 20.\nQ:\nDo any of Nuance\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Nuance\nstockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors with respect to the merger proposal,\nyou should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, the interests of Nuance stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the\nmerger agreement, (ii) approving the merger agreement and the merger, and (iii) unanimously recommending that\nthe merger agreement be adopted by Nuance stockholders, the Nuance Board of Directors was aware of and\nconsidered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For a description of\nthe interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 50.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?\nA:\nApproval of the merger-related compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote\nis an advisory vote and is not binding. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the\nmerger is completed, Nuance may still pay such compensation to its named executive officers in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one\nbrokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you\nhold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will\nreceive more than one proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or vote via the Internet or telephone\nwith respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.\nQ:\nWho counts the votes?\nA:\nVotes are counted by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., which we refer to as Broadridge, and are then certified\nby a representative of Broadridge appointed by the Nuance Board of Directors to serve as the inspector of\nelection at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nNuance stockholders who held shares of Nuance common stock as of the close of business on May 17, 2021.\nQ:\nWho pays for the expenses of this proxy solicitation?\nA:\nNuance will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including the preparation, printing, mailing and\ndistribution of these proxy materials. We may also reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing\nstockholders who hold their shares in street name for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy\nmaterials to such stockholders. In addition, certain directors, officers and other employees, without additional\nremuneration, may solicit proxies in person, or by telephone, facsimile, email and other methods of electronic\ncommunication.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhere can I find the vote results after the special meeting?\nA:\nWe are required to publish final vote results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four\nbusiness days after our special meeting. See the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 87.\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to\nthe merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Nuance common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock who exchanges shares of\nNuance common stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder, the merger generally will not result in tax to you\nunder U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections with the United States.\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see \u201cProposal 1:\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 54.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.\nThis description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it pertain to state, local or other tax\nconsequences. Consequently, you are urged to contact your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to you of the merger.\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of outstanding Nuance equity awards receive in the merger?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of Nuance\u2019s outstanding equity awards, see the section entitled \u201cTerms\nof the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation\u201d beginning on page 60.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?\nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of Nuance\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity Compensation - Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan\u201d beginning on page 61.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is adopted by Nuance\u2019s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person\nor by proxy) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their\ndemand for appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under\nSection 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Nuance common stock are entitled to have their shares\nappraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any,\nas determined by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who wish to\nseek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the\nexercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Stockholders should refer to the\ndiscussion under the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 80 and the DGCL requirements for\nexercising appraisal rights reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is \u201chouseholding\u201d?\nA:\nSome banks, brokers and similar institutions may be participating in the practice of \u201chouseholding\u201d proxy\nmaterials.

        "Section Text": "THE MERGER\nThis discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to\nthis proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the entire\nmerger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Nuance\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable\nprovisions of the DGCL, on the closing date and at the effective time, Sub will merge with and into Nuance, with\nNuance continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Nuance expects to\ndelist its common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common\nstock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Nuance will no longer be a\npublicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving\ncorporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration, as described under the section\nentitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Common Stock\u201d beginning on page 60.\nThe effective time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware (or at such later time as Nuance, Microsoft and Sub may agree in writing and specify in the certificate of\nmerger).\nEffect on Nuance if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, Nuance stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Nuance common stock. Instead, Nuance\nwill remain an independent public company, Nuance common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq\nand registered under the Exchange Act and Nuance will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be\nconsummated, it is likely that the price of Nuance common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is\nuncertain when, if ever, the price of Nuance common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date\nof this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Nuance common stock. If the merger is not consummated, the\nBoard of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Nuance\u2019s business operations, properties and capitalization,\namong other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder\nvalue. If the merger agreement is not adopted by Nuance stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any\nother reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Nuance or its stockholders will be\noffered or that Nuance\u2019s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Nuance will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515 million\nupon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger\nAgreement -Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 75.",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nMark Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer of Nuance, joined Nuance as Chief Executive Officer and a director on April\n23, 2018. On the date prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the closing price of Nuance common stock was $14.91 per\nshare. Mr. Benjamin was charged by the Nuance Board of Directors with leading the planning and execution of a\nstrategic transformation of Nuance, with the goal of increasing shareholder value. In furtherance of that charge and in\nkeeping with the Nuance Board of Directors\u2019 commitment to maximizing shareholder value, over the approximately\nthree-year period since Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment, the Nuance Board of Directors and management have regularly\nreviewed and discussed Nuance\u2019s business strategy, performance and competitive position as well as various\nstrategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial\n26TABLE OF CONTENTS\npartnerships and other strategic transactions. Since before Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of\nNuance, Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore, has rendered advice to Nuance regarding various\nstrategic and financial matters in support of these efforts by the Nuance Board of Directors.\nOver the past three years, the Nuance Board of Directors have through these efforts directed a transformation of\nNuance\u2019s business through a series of value-creating actions, including the sale of Nuance\u2019s imaging business in\nFebruary 2019, the spin-off of Cerence, Nuance\u2019s automotive business, in October 2019, and the sale of Nuance\u2019s\nHealth Information Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business\nin March 2021, as well as share repurchases and debt reduction activities. Through these transactions and other\nstrategic initiatives, Nuance has streamlined its portfolio to focus on the healthcare and enterprise AI segments,\nwhere the Nuance Board of Directors and management observed accelerated demand for advanced conversational AI\nand ambient solutions.\nIn July 2019, a large private equity firm, which we refer to as Party A, contacted senior management of Nuance and\nrequested a meeting to discuss a potential acquisition of Nuance and requested that Nuance provide a form\nnondisclosure agreement.\nAlso in July 2019, the chief executive officer of a global technology company, which we refer to as Party B, contacted\nMr. Benjamin and expressed interest in meeting to discuss conversational AI technologies, among other topics.\nOn July 22, 2019, Nuance and Party A signed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 15, 2019, members of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with representatives of Party A. The meeting\nconsisted of introductions of the Nuance and Party A teams and a high level discussion of Nuance\u2019s business. Party\nA made no proposal to acquire Nuance at that meeting and no immediate next steps were discussed. The closing\nprice of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.36 per share.\nOn August 21, 2019, Nuance and Party B amended an existing confidentiality agreement between the parties to,\namong other matters, extend the expiration date of such agreement. The amended nondisclosure agreement did not\ncontain a standstill provision.\nOn August 23, 2019, executives of Party B and Nuance, including the chief executive officer of each company, met to\nexplore whether there could be mutually beneficial ways for the two companies to work together, including potentially\na strategic partnership or an acquisition of Nuance by Party B. Following this meeting, Party B informed Nuance that\nit had elected not to proceed with further discussions regarding an acquisition transaction involving Nuance and\ncited a lack of strategic fit with Party B. The closing price of Nuance common stock on that date was $16.99 per share.\nBeginning prior to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Nuance in April 2018 and through\nOctober 2019, representatives of Nuance and representatives of Microsoft engaged in discussions regarding a\npotential commercial partnership whereby Microsoft would become Nuance\u2019s exclusive cloud provider and Nuance\nand Microsoft would work together to develop and commercialize technology products and services for the\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nhealthcare industry, including products that use AI technology.\nOn October 1, 2019, Nuance completed the spin-off of Cerence that it had announced on November 19, 2018.\nOn October 9, 2019, Microsoft and Nuance formalized their strategic partnership by entering into a license and\ncollaboration agreement and an amendment to an existing cloud hosting agreement between the parties.\nOn October 17, 2019, at Party A\u2019s request, representatives of Nuance and Party A spoke by telephone. Party A\nadvised the Nuance representatives that Party A would be interested in exploring an acquisition of Nuance and that it\nbelieved it could offer a market-premium to Nuance\u2019s then-current stock price of $15.75 if it could confirm a number of\nassumptions with respect to Nuance\u2019s business. Following that meeting, Party A provided Nuance with a due\ndiligence request list and proposed work plan that contemplated substantial engagement between the parties through\nthe end of the year.\nFollowing receipt of Party A\u2019s diligence request list and work plan, Nuance considered the risks and benefits of\npursuing a transaction with Party A at that time. In considering these matters, senior management noted that Nuance\nhad just completed its spin-off of Cerence and was nearing its first post-spin analyst day, scheduled for\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDecember 10, 2019, which Nuance had planned as a re-launch of the new, streamlined Nuance business. In light of\nNuance\u2019s focus on, and the critical importance of, the re-launch of the Nuance business following the Cerence spin-\noff and subsequent analyst day, the challenges and risks associated with diverting management time from those\nexecution priorities and the uncertainty regarding Party A\u2019s interest, Nuance determined to defer further\nconversations with Party A.\nIn late October 2019, representatives of Nuance spoke with representatives of Party A, and informed them that, in\nlight of the recently completed Cerence spin-off and the planned analyst day, Nuance was not prepared to engage in\ndiscussions regarding a potential sale transaction at that time.\nOn December 10, 2019, Nuance hosted its planned analyst day. On that date, the closing price of Nuance common\nstock was $17.60 per share.\nIn January 2020, a representative of Evercore reviewed in the ordinary course of business development activities with\nrepresentatives of a large healthcare services and technology company, which we refer to as Party C, a number of\npotential acquisition opportunities, one of which was a potential acquisition of Nuance. During the conversation,\nrepresentatives of Party C expressed interest in scheduling a meeting with Nuance in the upcoming weeks. At the\nrequest of Party C, the representative of Evercore discussed the possibility of an introduction to Party C with\nmembers of Nuance senior management, who authorized scheduling such a meeting. The meeting was first scheduled\nfor February 13, 2020, then rescheduled to March 30, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the rescheduled meeting was\npostponed indefinitely due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying volatility in the broader\nstock market, including a decline in the price of Nuance\u2019s common stock, which had closed at $14.79 per share on\nMarch 23, 2020.\nOn February 25, 2020, during a conversation regarding another company in the ordinary course of business\ndevelopment activities, a representative of a leading cloud technology and e-commerce company, which we refer to\nas Party D, conveyed to representatives of Evercore Party D\u2019s interest in meeting with the senior leadership of\nNuance to explore potential opportunities involving Nuance, ranging from a potential strategic partnership in\nhealthcare to a potential acquisition of Nuance. The representative of Party D characterized their interest as\npreliminary, and indicated that Party D was seeking the meeting to learn more about Nuance\u2019s healthcare business in\nlight of its own nascent activities in the space. Following that conversation, a representative of Evercore\ncommunicated to Nuance senior management Party D\u2019s interest in a meeting with Nuance senior leadership.\nRepresentatives of Nuance and Party D scheduled a meeting for April 9, 2020, but subsequently canceled that\nmeeting due to the developing COVID-19 pandemic. Following such cancellation, Party D did not seek to reengage\nwith Nuance and Nuance and Party D did not have further discussions.\nOn April 22, 2020, Mr. Benjamin and representatives of Party A had a telephone conversation for the purpose of\nkeeping in touch. During that conversation, Party A did not renew its request to meet with Nuance to discussion a\npotential transaction.\nOn or around May 14, 2020, a representative of Party C in a conversation with a representative of Evercore, indicated\nParty C\u2019s desire to reengage in discussions with Nuance. Following that conversation, the representative of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s interest to Nuance senior management, who scheduled such a meeting.\nOn June 19, 2020, representatives of Party C met with members of Nuance senior management at Nuance\u2019s offices. At\nthat meeting, Nuance representatives provided a high level overview of Nuance\u2019s Healthcare business based only on\npublicly available information, and Party C requested a second meeting to review Nuance\u2019s Enterprise business and\nto address follow up questions relating to the Healthcare business.\nOn June 26, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the Nuance\nBoard of Directors of the meeting with representatives of Party C. Following extensive discussion, the Nuance Board\nof Directors instructed Nuance management to hold another in-person meeting with Party C as had been requested\nby Party C.\nOn July 9, 2020, representatives of Party C had a phone conversation with Nuance senior executives to discuss\nNuance technology.\nOn July 22, 2020, representatives of Party C met with representatives of Nuance at Nuance\u2019s offices, during which the\nrepresentatives of Party C and Nuance discussed Nuance\u2019s Enterprise and Healthcare businesses.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 27, 2020, a representative of Party C informed a representative of Evercore that Party C was interested in\nfurther exploring a potential acquisition of Nuance. A representative of Evercore communicated Party C\u2019s interests to\nmembers of Nuance senior management.\nOn or around September 7, 2020, a senior executive of Party C contacted Mr. Benjamin and conveyed a request from\nthe Chief Executive Officer of Party C for another meeting at Nuance\u2019s offices and a demonstration of Nuance\u2019s\nDragon\u00ae Ambient eXperience\u2122 product, which we refer to as DAX.\nOn September 11, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, a representative of\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Nuance\u2019s external legal counsel, which we refer to as Paul Weiss,\nreviewed with the Nuance Board of Directors the directors\u2019 duties in the context of a potential acquisition offer.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors instructed Mr. Benjamin to have the meeting with the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Party C.\nOn September 15, 2020, representatives of Nuance\u2019s senior management met with the Chief Executive Officer of Party\nC and the president of one of Party C\u2019s divisions. At that meeting, Nuance representatives answered questions\nregarding the business and gave a demonstration of DAX. During the meeting, Mr. Benjamin made clear that he\nbelieved Nuance was in a strong position and expressed his view that the market was not overvaluing Nuance\u2019s\nshares. After such meeting, the representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Evercore that the recent\nincrease in Nuance\u2019s share price had created valuation challenges for Party C in pursuing an acquisition of Nuance,\nnoting that the price of Nuance common stock had increased from approximately $25.00 per share when Party C\nbegan discussions in June 2020 to $32.97 as of close of trading on September 15, 2020. Representatives of Evercore\ncommunicated Party C\u2019s views to members of Nuance senior management.\nOn September 18, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin updated the\nNuance Board of Directors on discussions with representatives of Party C. Also at that meeting, the Nuance Board of\nDirectors received an update from Nuance management on Nuance\u2019s stock performance, including Nuance\u2019s 5-year\nprice performance and trading multiples relative to peers.\nOn September 29, 2020, representatives of Party C informed representatives of Nuance and Evercore that Party C did\nnot wish to pursue a strategic transaction with Nuance at that time or for the foreseeable future, primarily due to Party\nC\u2019s view on Nuance\u2019s valuation and that any offer at a \u201cmarket\u201d premium to Nuance would be too dilutive to Party\nC\u2019s stockholders. They indicated that they could be interested in making an offer in the future if Nuance\u2019s share price\nwere to fall appreciably from where it was then trading, and in the meantime would like to continue to build upon the\ncommercial aspects of the relationship between Nuance and Party C. The closing price of Nuance common stock on\nthat date was $33.07 per share, which was approximately 121.8% higher than the closing price of Nuance common\nstock on April 23, 2018, the date that Mr. Benjamin became Chief Executive Officer (or approximately 165.0% higher if\nincluding the value of the Cerence shares received by Nuance stockholders in the Cerence spin-off).\nOn October 2, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Mr. Benjamin informed the\nNuance Board of Directors of Party C\u2019s decision not to pursue a transaction.\nOn November 11, 2020, a representative of Evercore had, in the ordinary course of business development activities,\nan introductory conversation with a senior executive at Microsoft. In the course of such conversation, which\naddressed multiple topics, including Microsoft\u2019s activities in the healthcare sector, the Evercore representative\ndiscussed recent developments with respect to Nuance. These discussions were preliminary and based solely on\npublicly available information, and no valuations involving Nuance were discussed. The representative of Microsoft\nexpressed Microsoft\u2019s strategic interest in Nuance\u2019s healthcare business, especially given the success of the\nongoing partnership between the two companies, but noted that Microsoft\u2019s willingness to consider a potential\ntransaction was tempered by the highly people-intensive nature of Nuance\u2019s Health Information Management\nTranscription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business.\nOn November 18, 2020, in conjunction with its earnings announcement, Nuance announced the sale of its Health\nInformation Management Transcription business and its Electronic Health Record Go-Live Services business, which\nNuance had been negotiating over the prior several months.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 19, 2020, representatives of Microsoft contacted representatives of Evercore and requested a meeting\nwith Nuance\u2019s management in order to begin evaluating the merits of a potential acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft.\nDuring this discussion, the representatives of Microsoft noted that the process would include a series of business\nand financial due diligence meetings to validate whether Microsoft did indeed want to pursue an acquisition of\nNuance. Representatives of Evercore conveyed this request to Mr. Benjamin.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting at which Mr. Benjamin\ninformed the Nuance Board of Directors of Microsoft\u2019s request for a meeting to explore a potential acquisition.\nFollowing discussion, the Nuance Board of Directors authorized a meeting with Microsoft to discuss with Microsoft\nonly publicly available information concerning Nuance.\nOn December 7, 2020, representatives of Microsoft and representatives of Nuance held an initial meeting at which\nthose present discussed Nuance\u2019s business and the potential benefits of a combination.\nOn December 18, 2020, representatives of Party C and representatives of Nuance had a telephone discussion focused\non potential commercial partnership opportunities between Party C and Nuance. There was no discussion of an\nacquisition of Nuance by Party C in that conversation.\nFollowing the meeting on December 7, 2020, various representatives of Microsoft had follow-up conversations with\nrepresentatives of Nuance, in the course of which representatives of Microsoft requested follow-up meetings with\nNuance in January to review Nuance\u2019s Healthcare and Enterprise businesses and the potential long-term\nopportunities for the two companies on a combined basis. Representatives of Microsoft indicated that following\nsuch meetings and shortly after Nuance\u2019s next earnings release, Microsoft intended to either make a formal proposal\nfor an acquisition of Nuance or notify Nuance that it did not wish to move forward with making an offer.\nOn December 22, 2020, at a videoconference meeting of the Nuance Board of Directors, Nuance management updated\nthe Nuance Board of Directors on its discussions with Microsoft. The Nuance Board of Directors authorized Nuance\nmanagement to schedule the additional meetings that Microsoft had requested.\nOn January 9, 2021, Microsoft and Nuance executed a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement did\nnot contain a standstill provision.\nDuring January 2021, representatives of Microsoft and Nuance held several virtual due diligence sessions, focused\non issues including technology, enterprise, go-to-market, financials and potential synergies.\nOn February 2, 2021, the Nuance Board of Directors held a videoconference meeting with members of Nuance senior\nmanagement, as well as representatives of Evercore and Paul Weiss, attending. At the meeting, representatives of\nEvercore updated the Nuance Board of Directors on the discussions with Microsoft, and members of Nuance\nmanagement presented to the Nuance Board of Directors financial forecasts for Nuance for the 2021-2025 fiscal years,\nwhich are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201c",

The Nuance Forecasts\nwere not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because such\ninformation was made available as described above. The Nuance Forecasts were not prepared with a view to\ncompliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP,\nthe published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial information.

Our non-employee directors hold\nRSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our\nexecutive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the\ntreatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:\nStock Options\nEach stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock\nthat would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable\nwithholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the\noption will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.\nStock Units\n\u2022\nEach award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will\nbecome vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the\noccurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a\nRollover RSU as follows:\n\u25cb\nEach RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting\nschedule as the RSU.\n\u25cb\nEach PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based\nsolely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.\n\u25cb\nThe number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the\nproduct (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock\nsubject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a\nspecified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of Nuance common stock subject\nto each PSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum\nperformance, for any PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and\n(ii) target performance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals.\nFor each PSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is\ncurrently performing at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nas would not result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThis compensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new\nequity award, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the\nlast trading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,\n2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new\nparticipants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will\ntake all actions necessary to provide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\nAccelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations\nNone of the Nuance equity awards provide for \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting immediately at the effective time (i.e., as a\nresult of the transaction with Microsoft without a termination of employment). However, under the terms of our\nequity incentive plans and the award agreements for the RSUs and PSUs (as such agreements may be amended in\naccordance with the terms of the merger agreement) and, for certain employees, individual employment or change of\ncontrol severance agreements, the vesting of the Rollover RSUs (i.e., the stock-based awards of Microsoft) that are\nconverted at the effective time from unvested RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger\nagreement will accelerate on a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d basis on qualifying terminations of employment after the effective\ntime, as follows:\n\u2022\nAny such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above (including our\nexecutive officers) who is a party to a change of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the\none-year period immediately following the effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by the\nemployer without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\n\u2022\nAny such award held by an executive with the title of senior vice president or above who is not a party to a\nchange of control severance agreement will accelerate if, during the one-year period immediately following\nthe effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by the executive for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\n\u2022\nAny such award held by any employee (including our executive officers) will accelerate if, at any time\nbefore the award is scheduled to vest, the employee\u2019s employment is terminated by the employer without\n\u201ccause\u201d or due to the employee\u2019s resignation as a result of the employee\u2019s refusal to consent to a required\nrelocation of the employee\u2019s principal place of employment of more than 50 miles.\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Nuance in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Nuance Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors and executive officers may have\ninterests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Nuance\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among\nother matters, in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger\nagreement and the merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of\nNuance.\nValue of Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the merger consideration payable with respect to Nuance shares held by our non-\nemployee directors and executive officers, as a group, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, is approximately\n$90.5 million.\nThe estimated aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive officers,\nincluding our named executive officers, that would accelerate in connection with the merger, assuming the merger\nclosed on May 14, 2021, and, immediately thereafter, the director\u2019s service terminated, or the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment was terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the executive officer resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with Nuance) is approximately $5.2 million for our non-\nemployee directors, and approximately $228.2 million for our executive officers. These values do not include any new\nNuance equity awards that may be granted before the merger closes, as such awards will not have termination of\nemployment protections. These values are calculated based on the multiplying the number of shares underlying\nawards by the cash consideration (based on the maximum number of shares underlying the relative TSR PSUs and\ntarget number of shares underlying the financial metric PSUs). For estimates of the value of such unvested equity\nawards for each of our named executive officers individually, see below under \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\nPotential Payments to Executive Officers upon Termination in Connection with the Merger\nWe have entered into agreements with our executive officers, including our named executive officers, which would\nentitle the executives to severance payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in\nconnection with the merger:\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin\u2019s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by the\ncompany without \u201ccause\u201d or if he resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as each such term is defined in his\nagreement), in either case during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a\nchange of control (which will occur at the effective time), he will be entitled to receive:\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 250% of his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the\ntermination date or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 200% of his target annual bonus for the year in which his termination\noccurs\u037e\n\u25cb\na pro-rated payment of his target annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of\nthe fiscal year completed\u037e\n\u25cb\nfull vesting of his outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that are\nconverted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under \u201cTreatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncontinued company-paid health insurance coverage for 18 months for him and his eligible dependents.\n\u2022\nEach of our other executive officers (including our other named executive officers) has a change of control\nand severance agreement that provides that if within one year after a change of control (which will occur at\nthe effective time), the officer\u2019s employment is terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the officer\nresigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as each such term is defined in the agreement), the officer will be entitled to\nreceive:\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 12 months of base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination\ndate or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n\u25cb\na lump sum payment equal to 100% of the greater of the executive\u2019s annual target bonus for the year\nof termination or the executive\u2019s target bonus in effect immediately prior to the change of control\u037e\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nfull vesting of the officer\u2019s outstanding time-based equity awards (including any Rollover RSUs that\nare converted from PSUs at the effective time, as described above under \u201cTreatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d)\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncontinued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12 months.\nAs a condition to receipt of the severance payments and benefits described above, each executive officer is required\nto execute a separation and release of claims agreement in favor of the company and its affiliates and to continue to\ncomply with certain post-termination covenants in favor of the company and its affiliates.\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance our executive officers, including our named executive officers,\nwould have received upon a qualifying termination of employment, assuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021, and\nthe qualifying termination occurred immediately thereafter, is approximately $10.3 million. For estimates of the\namounts of such cash severance that each of our named executive officers would have received individually, see\nbelow under \u201cGolden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\nThe employment agreement with Mr. Benjamin and the change of control and severance agreement with Mr.\nTempesta will be modified, effective upon the closing of the merger, as further described below under \u201cNew\nArrangements with Microsoft.\u201d\nFuture Nuance Equity Grants\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may continue to grant ordinary course equity awards, including annual\nawards to employees with the title of vice president or below on or about July 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up\nto $41.5 million), annual awards to employees with the title of senior vice president or above (including our executive\nofficers) on or about November 1, 2021 (with an aggregate value of up to $38 million), and awards to new hires (with\nan aggregate value of up to $7.4 million), in each case, if the effective time has not yet occurred. These awards will be\ngranted in the form of time-vesting RSUs that will not accelerate in connection with the merger or termination of\nemployment (whether occurring before or after the effective time). We may also make ordinary course annual awards\nto our non-employee directors in January 2022, if the effective time has not yet occurred, in the form of time-vesting\nRSUs (with a grant date value not to exceed $250,000 per director, as provided under our 2020 Stock Plan).\nSpecial Bonuses\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may grant special cash bonuses to employees (including our executive\nofficers) in an aggregate amount of up to $25 million and enter into agreements to provide for such bonuses. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement, no such bonuses have been granted.\nNew Arrangements with Microsoft\nCEO and CFO Letter Agreements with Microsoft\nThe following is a summary of the material terms of the letter agreements entered into on April 11, 2021, between each\nof Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta and Microsoft, in each case, subject to the closing of the merger:\n\u2022\nMessrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will continue to serve as Nuance\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, respectively\u037e\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin will report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s Executive Vice President of Cloud + AI Group (or his\nsuccessor), and Mr. Tempesta will report to Mr. Benjamin (or, upon his death, his successor)\u037e\n\u2022\nTheir annual salaries and target annual bonuses will remain the same as currently in effect ($800,000 salary\nand target bonus of 150% of salary, for Mr. Benjamin\u037e $500,000 salary and target bonus of 75% of salary, for\nMr. Tempesta)\u037e\n\u2022\nFollowing the closing, Messrs. Benjamin and Tempesta will be eligible for annual equity awards, with a\ntarget grant date value of $9,000,000 for Mr. Benjamin and $2,750,000 for Mr. Tempesta, with vesting and\nperformance terms similar to those applicable to similarly situated executives of Nuance, subject to any\nstub period as the equity grant cycles of Microsoft and Nuance are harmonized\u037e and\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nMr. Benjamin will be granted an on-hire performance stock award for shares of Microsoft common stock,\nwhich will be eligible to vest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance\ngoals over four performance periods ending June 30, 2025. The number of shares underlying such award\nwill be equal to $15,000,000 divided by Microsoft\u2019s closing stock price as of the closing date.\nThe letter agreements also amend Mr. Benjamin\u2019s employment agreement and Mr. Tempesta\u2019s change of control and\nseverance agreement, as follows:\n\u2022\nThe employment and change of control and severance agreements will remain in effect until the third\nanniversary of the effective time, unless earlier terminated in accordance with their terms\u037e\n\u2022\nThe \u201cgood reason\u201d definitions in the employment and change of control severance agreements will be\nmodified, including to provide that the executives will not be considered to have an adverse change in\nduties or responsibilities that would constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d solely by reason of the merger or Nuance\nbecoming a subsidiary of Microsoft. Instead:\n\u25cb\nMr. Benjamin will have \u201cgood reason\u201d if he ceases to run the Nuance business unit reporting directly\nto Mr. Guthrie or his successor, as such business unit evolves based on Microsoft\u2019s additions to or\nsubtractions from the business unit from time to time\u037e and\n\u25cb\nMr. Tempesta will have \u201cgood reason\u201d if he is assigned duties and responsibilities that, in the\naggregate, are materially inconsistent with being a chief financial officer of an operating business of a\npublic company or if he ceases to report directly to Mr. Benjamin or his successor\u037e\n\u2022\nAny equity awards granted to either executive after the date of the letter agreement will not be subject to\nthe accelerated vesting provisions of the employment or change of control severance agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nEach executive will receive the severance payments and benefits provided under the employment or change\nof control severance agreement, and full vesting of the equity awards granted to each executive before the\ndate of the letter agreement on any of the following terminations of employment,:\n\u25cb\nif at any time on or following the effective time, the executive\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in Microsoft\u2019s Senior Executive Severance Plan) or terminates due to the\nexecutive\u2019s death or disability\u037e\n\u25cb\nif on or within 12 months after the effective time, the executive resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as modified\npursuant to the letter agreement)\u037e or\n\u25cb\nif between the 12-month and three-year anniversaries of the effective time, the executive resigns for\nany reason.\n\u2022\nFollowing the third anniversary of the effective time, each executive will be eligible to participate in\nMicrosoft\u2019s severance plan applicable to similarly situated employees of Microsoft.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of the payments\nand benefits that each named executive officer of Nuance would have received in connection with the merger,\nassuming the merger closed on May 14, 2021 and, immediately thereafter, the employment of the named executive\nofficer was terminated by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or the named executive officer resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each such term, as defined in the applicable agreement with the named executive officer). This compensation is\nsubject to an advisory vote of Nuance\u2019s stockholders, as described below under the section entitled \u201cProposal 2:\nAdvisory Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 77.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe calculations in the tables below do not include any new Nuance equity awards or special bonuses that may be\ngranted to the named executive officers before the merger closes. In addition to the assumptions regarding the\nclosing date of the merger and termination of the employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are\nbased on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the tables below. Accordingly,\nthe ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the\namounts set forth below.\nOfficer\nCash \n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits \n($)(3)\nTotal \n($)\nMark Benjamin\n$5,143,014\n$99,975,904\n$46,063\n$105,164,981\nDaniel Tempesta\n$875,000\n$31,830,434\n$30,785\n$32,736,219\nRobert Dahdah\n$875,000\n$16,537,136\n$7,458\n$\u200b17,419,594\nJoseph Petro\n$875,000\n$27,822,122\n$23,442\n$28,720,563\nRobert Weideman\n$875,000\n$28,936,914\n$20,550\n$29,832,464\n(1)\nCash. The amounts in this column reflect the value of the cash severance payments payable to each named executive officer and,\nfor Mr. Benjamin, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination. For Mr. Benjamin, his severance is equal to the sum of\n250% of his annual base salary plus 200% of his target bonus. For the other named executive officers, the severance is equal to\n100% of the officer\u2019s base salary and target bonus for the year of termination (or, if greater, the target bonus for the year of the\nmerger). The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Benjamin are $4,400,000 for severance and $743,014 for\nprorated annual bonus. The severance and prorated bonus payments are all \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that payment\nof these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months following the merger\n(except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within 12 months following\nthe merger).\n(2)\nEquity. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate values of the accelerated vesting of the Rollover RSUs. These amounts\nare \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that the accelerated vesting is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment on or after the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior\nto or within 12 months following the merger). In connection with the merger, Mr. Benjamin will be entitled to receive a\nMicrosoft equity award with a number of shares underlying such award equal to $15,000,000, divided by Microsoft's closing stock\nprice as of the closing date, as described above under \u201cNew Arrangements with Microsoft\u201d. The equity award will be eligible to\nvest between 0% and 200% of target based on the achievement of performance goals over four performance periods ending June\n30, 2025, but this award does not provide for acceleration upon any termination of Mr. Benjamin\u2019s employment and is not\nincluded in this table.\n(3)\nPerquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column reflect the value of continued company-paid health insurance coverage for 12\nmonths (except for Mr. Benjamin, coverage for 18 months). The amounts in this column are \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which\nmeans that payment of these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or within the 12 months\nfollowing the merger (except for Mr. Benjamin, upon a qualifying termination of employment three months prior to or within\n12 months following the merger).\nFinancing of the Merger\nThe merger is not conditioned on Microsoft\u2019s ability to obtain financing. Microsoft has represented to Nuance that it\nhas available and will have available at the effective time the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger\nconsideration, including (i) payments to Nuance\u2019s stockholders of the amounts due under the merger agreement and\n(ii) payments in respect of certain of Nuance\u2019s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S.\nholders (each as defined below) of Nuance common stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the Code. This summary is based on the\nCode, the U.S. Treasury Department regulations issued under the Code, which we refer to as the Treasury\nRegulations, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, all of\nwhich are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is not binding on the Internal\nRevenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, or a court and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences\ndescribed in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a court if so\nchallenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or\nother entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United\nStates is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) the trust has a\nvalid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. A \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Nuance common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor\na partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis summary is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and, in\nparticular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Nuance common stock\nwho are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law including, for example, partnerships (or an\nentity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein, financial\ninstitutions, dealers in securities, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, mutual funds, real estate investment\ntrusts, personal holding companies, regulated investment companies, securities or currency dealers, traders in\nsecurities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting, non-U.S. holders that hold, directly or\nconstructively (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of\nthe merger), 5% or more of the outstanding Nuance common stock, tax-exempt investors, S corporations or other\npass-through entities, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-deferred or other retirement\naccounts, U.S. expatriates, former long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired Nuance common\nstock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who\nhold Nuance common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other\nintegrated investment. Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to\nholders of Nuance common stock who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. In addition, no information is\nprovided with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under any U.S. federal law other than income tax laws\n(including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws), or any applicable\nstate, local, or foreign tax laws. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than\nthe merger.\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Nuance common stock,\nthe tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds\nNuance common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors\nregarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific circumstances.\nThe tax consequences of the merger will depend on a holder\u2019s specific situation. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisor as to the tax consequences of the merger relevant to their particular circumstances, including the\napplicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes\nin those laws.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder\nwho receives cash in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain\nor loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) the\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Nuance common stock exchanged therefor.\nA U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Nuance common stock will generally equal the price the U.S. holder\npaid for such shares. If a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Nuance common stock surrendered in the\nmerger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss.\nLong-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Nuance common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S.\nholder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Nuance\ncommon stock.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nPayments made to a non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business\nof the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is\nattributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States) in which case such gain\nwill generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to U.S. holders and, if such non-U.S.\nholder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or\nlower applicable treaty rate)\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the\nexchange of shares of Nuance common stock for the merger consideration pursuant to the merger and\ncertain other conditions are met, in which case the gain, if any, on such shares of Nuance common stock\nwill be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) and such gain may be offset by U.S.\nsource capital losses recognized in the same taxable year.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of cash to a U.S. holder of Nuance common stock pursuant to the merger may, under certain circumstances,\nbe subject to backup withholding, unless the holder furnishes its taxpayer identification number, certifies that the\nnumber is correct, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain\nholders (such as corporations and non-U.S. holders) are exempt from backup withholding. Cash received in the\nmerger will also be subject to information reporting unless an exemption applies.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nrefunded or credited against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the\nrequired information to the IRS in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders may be required to comply with certification\nrequirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and backup\nwithholding.\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of\nall tax consequences relating to the merger. Holders of Nuance common stock are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors with respect to the tax consequences of the merger in their particular circumstances, including the\napplicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes\nin those laws.\nRegulatory Approvals\nGeneral\nNuance and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory filing and\nnotification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required or recommended to consummate the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval under, or\nnotifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the European Union and any relevant European\nUnion Member States, the United Kingdom and Australia.\nIn addition, each of Nuance and Microsoft have agreed to (1) cooperate and coordinate with each other to make such\nfilings\u037e (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that may be required in order to\nmake such filings\u037e (3) use its reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information that reasonably may be\nrequested to obtain regulatory approvals\u037e (4) use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to obtain\nregulatory approvals as soon as practicable\u037e and (5) provide notice to the other party if it plans to participate in any\nmaterial meeting or substantive conversation with respect to the merger.\nIf and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Sub and, solely to the extent\nrequested by Microsoft, Nuance will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order\nor otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproducts or businesses of Nuance (whether directly or by the disposition of the capital stock or other equity or\nvoting interest in the entities in which such assets, rights, products or businesses are held)\u037e and\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(B) any other restrictions on the activities of the Nuance\u037e and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings,\nwhether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not required to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any\naction with respect to Nuance that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,\nassets, liabilities, financial condition or results of the operations of Nuance. Microsoft is also not required to offer,\nnegotiate, commit to, effect or otherwise take any action with respect to its business if taking such action would\nreasonably be expected to (1) have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by\nMicrosoft or (2) have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft and its\nsubsidiaries.\nHSR Act and Other Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until Nuance and\nMicrosoft file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the \u201cFTC,\u201d and\nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the \u201cDOJ,\u201d under the HSR Act and the\napplicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be\ncompleted until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR\nAct notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The DOJ or the FTC may extend the 30 day\nwaiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information and documentary materials (also known as a Second\nRequest). If either agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties\nsubstantially comply with the request.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and\nnotwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the\nantitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin\nthe completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek\nto take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws\nNuance and Microsoft conduct business in Member States of the European Union. Council Regulation (EC) No.\n139/2004, as amended, and accompanying regulations allow parties to ask the European Commission to review\nmergers and acquisitions that trigger national merger control filing requirements in at least three European Union\nMember States. The parties will file such a referral request as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable following\nwhich competent Member States have 15 working days to object to the referral. In the event that there is no such\nobjection, the transaction will be reviewable by the European Commission and the parties will then file a formal\nnotification of the merger with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable.\nPursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, the European Commission has 25 business days from the day\nfollowing the date of receipt of a complete notification, which period may be extended to 35 business days under\ncertain circumstances, in which to consider whether the merger would significantly impede effective competition in\nthe common market (as defined by European Community regulations) or a substantial part of it, in particular as a\nresult of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position. By the end of that period, the European Commission\nmust issue a decision either clearing the merger, which may be conditional upon the parties offering suitable\nremedies, or opening an in-depth \u201cPhase II\u201d investigation. A Phase II investigation lasts for 90 business days, which\nmay be extended by an additional 35 business days under certain circumstances. At the end of the Phase II\ninvestigation the European Commission may either unconditionally approve the merger, conditionally approve the\nmerger subject to remedies or prohibit the merger if no adequate remedies have been proposed by Microsoft. The\nmerger cannot be completed during the European Commission\u2019s review of the merger.\nIn the event that a competent Member State of the European Union objects to the referral to the European\nCommission requested by the parties, the merger agreement contemplates that the necessary clearances, approvals or\ndecisions under the national competition laws of Austria, Germany, Denmark, Spain and Portugal (to the extent filings\nin such jurisdictions are required) will be conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to consummate the merger.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe completion of the merger is also subject to obtaining a favorable outcome from the UK\u2019s Competition and\nMarkets Authority, which we refer to as the CMA. Such an outcome can take the form of either (i) the CMA\nindicating that it has no further questions about the merger in response to a briefing paper submitted by the parties\u037e\nor (ii) if a formal notification is made, the CMA approving the merger unconditionally or conditional upon adequate\nremedies being offered.\nIf a formal notification is made, the CMA has 40 business days in which to complete its initial review (Phase I), at the\nend of which it must confirm whether it believes that the merger results in a realistic prospect of a substantial\nlessening of competition. If so, the merger must be referred to an in-depth review (Phase II), unless adequate\nremedies are offered by the parties within 5 working days of the CMA\u2019s Phase I decision. Where Phase I remedies are\noffered, the CMA must decide whether to accept the remedies \u201cin principle\u201d within 10 working days of the Phase I\ndecision and must take a final decision on whether to accept the remedies within 50 working days of the Phase I\ndecision, subject to a possible 40 working day extension at the CMA\u2019s discretion. If a Phase II investigation is\nlaunched, the CMA has 24 weeks, extendable by up to eight weeks at the CMA\u2019s discretion if it considers there are\nspecial reasons for doing so, to decide if the merger should be prohibited or approved conditional on remedies.\nThe completion of the merger is also subject to certain notifications and/or approvals in accordance with the\ncompetition laws of Australia. The parties must also observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary\napprovals, clearances or consents in the required foreign jurisdictions before completing the merger.\nThe parties will file merger notifications with the appropriate regulators in each of the required foreign jurisdictions as\npromptly as practicable and work cooperatively toward expedited regulatory clearances.\nForeign Direct Investment Laws\nCompletion of the merger is further subject to receipt of certain other foreign direct investment review approvals,\nincluding notification, clearance and/or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period in certain specified\ncountries.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by Nuance stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nmerger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the\nconditions to the merger not being satisfied.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

        "Section Text": "TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the\nmerger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and\nin its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is\nimportant to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Nuance, Microsoft and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the\nmerger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those\ngenerally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential\nmatters disclosed to Microsoft and Sub by Nuance in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the\nrepresentations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating\ncontractual risk between Nuance, Microsoft and Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject\nto standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in\nwhich a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and\nwarranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Nuance\nstockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of Nuance, Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the\ndate of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or\nwarranty may have been included in this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the\nmerger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Nuance, Microsoft and Sub, because the\nparties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the\nmerger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior\nnotice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding\nNuance, Microsoft, Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and\nother agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided\nelsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Nuance and our business.",

        "Section Header": "Conversion of Shares",
        "Section Text": "Conversion of Shares\nCommon Stock\nAt the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Nuance common stock (other than shares held by (1)\nNuance as treasury stock\u037e (2) Microsoft, Sub or their respective subsidiaries\u037e and (3) Nuance stockholders who have\nproperly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to such shares)\nwill be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (which is\n$56.00 per share, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes).\nAt the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock held by (1) Nuance or (2) Microsoft, Sub\nor their respective subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in\nexchange therefor.\nTreatment of Equity Compensation\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Nuance common stock in the\nform of stock options and stock units. Our executive officers hold RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of\nNuance common stock based on service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to\nreceive shares of Nuance common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares based on both\nservice and achievement of performance goals for a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold\nRSUs and DSUs, which represents a right to receive shares of Nuance common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as separation from service. Our\nexecutive officers and non-employee directors do not hold stock options. The merger agreement provides for the\ntreatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:\nStock Options\nEach stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will, at the effective time, be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration for each share of Nuance common stock\nthat would have been issuable upon exercise of the option, less the exercise price of the option and any applicable\nwithholding taxes. If the exercise price of a stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, the\noption will be cancelled as of the effective time for no consideration.\nStock Units\n\u2022\nEach award of stock units that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the effective time or that will\nbecome vested by its terms at the effective time and, in each case, by its terms is to be settled upon the\noccurrence of vesting or the effective time will, as of the effective time, be deemed to be vested and will be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n60TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nEach outstanding and unvested award of stock units will, as of the effective time, be converted into a\nRollover RSU as follows:\n\u25cb\nEach RSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that is subject to the same time-based vesting\nschedule as the RSU.\n\u25cb\nEach PSU will be converted into a Rollover RSU that, following the effective time, will vest based\nsolely on time at the conclusion of the original performance period of the PSU.\n\u25cb\nThe number of shares of common stock of Microsoft subject to each Rollover RSU will be equal to the\nproduct (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of the number of Nuance shares of common stock\nsubject to the corresponding RSU or PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by a\nspecified exchange ratio (see below). The number of Nuance shares of common stock subject to each\nPSU immediately prior to the effective time will be determined based on (i) maximum performance, for\nany PSU that was subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, and (ii) target\nperformance, for any PSU that was subject to financial and/or operational performance goals. For each\nPSU that is subject to relative total shareholder return performance goals, Nuance is currently\nperforming at a level that would result in maximum performance payout.\n\u25cb\nNotwithstanding the treatment of awards of outstanding and unvested stock units described above,\nMicrosoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and\nconverting an award into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to each share of\nNuance common stock subject to the award, less any applicable withholding taxes).\n\u2022\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance), Microsoft will\nprovide compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have\nbeen provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would\nnot result in the imposition of additional taxes under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This\ncompensation will be provided in the form of a cash payment (less any applicable taxes) or a new equity\naward, as reasonably determined by Microsoft in consultation with Nuance.\n\u2022\nFor purposes of the conversion of Nuance stock units described above, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d is defined as\na fraction, the numerator of which is the merger consideration and the denominator of which is the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of Microsoft common stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending with the\nlast trading day immediately prior to the closing.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn accordance with the plan terms, each ESPP participant in the current offering period, which began on February 16,\n2021, may not increase his or her payroll contribution rate or make separate non-payroll contributions, and no new\nparticipants may enroll in the current offering period. In connection with the transaction with Microsoft, Nuance will\ntake all actions necessary to provide that:\n\u2022\nif the closing occurs prior to August 13, 2021, which is the last day of the current offering period:\n\u25cb\ncause the current offering period to terminate no later than five business days prior to the closing\ndate\u037e\n\u25cb\nmake any pro-rata adjustments necessary to reflect the shortened offering period\u037e and\n\u25cb\ncause the exercise (as of no later than one business day before the effective time) of each outstanding\npurchase right and apply the funds credited to each participant\u2019s payroll withholding account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Nuance common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide that no new offering period or purchase period will commence\u037e and\n\u2022\nterminate the ESPP in its entirety, effective as of the effective time.\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

        "Section Text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person or by proxy) in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger proposal and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their shares and who do not\nwithdraw such demand or lose their right to appraisal will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as Section 262.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of\nrecord of shares of Nuance common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that\nholder\u2019s name. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or a \u201cholder of shares\u201d are to the\nrecord holder of shares unless otherwise noted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Nuance common\nstock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to\ncause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal\nrights. If you hold your shares of Nuance common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of Nuance common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e\n(ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time\u037e and (iii) otherwise follow the\nprocedures set forth in, and do not otherwise withdraw or lose their rights under, Section 262 will be entitled to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the merger\nconsideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court\n(subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective date of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e provided that, if at any time before the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation\npays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment\nonly on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued prior to\nthe time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to\nmake such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal\nshould be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the $56.00 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal\nrights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement\nconstitutes Nuance\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and\nthe full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any holder\nof shares of Nuance\u2019s common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such\nholder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex B carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, assuming our shares\nremain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the\ncase), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Nuance stockholders who assert\nappraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been\npursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Nuance common stock measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate merger consideration in respect of the\nshares of Nuance common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. We\nrefer to these requirements as\n80TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe ownership conditions. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of\nshares of Nuance common stock, Nuance believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that\nstockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A stockholder who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be\nentitled to receive the merger consideration as described in the merger agreement upon surrender of the certificates\nthat formerly represented such shares of Nuance common stock.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Nuance common stock must fully\ncomply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Nuance a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nproposal at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the\neffective time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder (or a beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf the stockholder demanded appraisal) or\nthe surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.",

If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should\nnot assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair values\nof shares of Nuance common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Nuance common stock who desire to have\ntheir shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware should assume that they will be responsible\nfor filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the manner prescribed in\nSection 262.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of Nuance common stock who has\ncomplied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger\nproposal and with respect to which Nuance received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after\nreceipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal, whichever is later.\n82TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Nuance common stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to\nfile with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. We refer to this below as the verified list. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The\nCourt of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the\nproceedings. In addition, assuming Nuance common stock remains listed on a national securities exchange\nimmediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the case), the Court of Chancery is required to dismiss\nthe appraisal proceedings as to all holders of dissenting shares unless one of the ownership conditions is satisfied.",

        "Section Header": "Determination of Fair Value",
        "Section Text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Nuance common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Nuance common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\namount determined to be the fair value. The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. In determining fair value, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in\nthe financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously\nrequires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d Section 262 provides that fair value\nis to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising\nfrom such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although\nNuance believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of\nfair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that\nsuch an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger\nconsideration. Neither Nuance nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the $56.00 per share consideration to any\nstockholder of Nuance exercising appraisal rights. Each of Nuance and Microsoft reserves the right to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Nuance common stock is less\nthan the $56.00 per share consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Nuance common stock entitled to\nparticipate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may, in its discretion, proceed\nto trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of\nshares of Nuance common stock whose name appears on the verified list and, if such shares are represented by\ncertificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of Nuance common stock to the\nDelaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such\nstockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair\nvalue of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto.\nPayment will be made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of\n83TABLE OF CONTENTS\nuncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to\nthe surviving corporation of the certificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may\nbe enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nUnless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e\nprovided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal\nproceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will\naccrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\nand (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. The costs\nof the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery of\nthe State of Delaware deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in\nconnection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Nuance common stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Nuance\ncommon stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger\nconsideration less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, if\nneither of the ownership conditions is satisfied or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with\nSection 262.\nFrom and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Nuance\ncommon stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Nuance common stock, if any, payable to stockholders of\nNuance of record as of a time prior to the effective time\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed,\nor if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written\napproval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal\nis filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed\nas to any stockholder of Nuance without the approval of the court\u037e provided that this provision will not affect the\nright of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party\nto withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days\nafter the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory\nappraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of Nuance wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to\nconsult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a\nprovision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this\nsection, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d)\nAppraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1)\nIf a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to\nbe submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to\nthe meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such\nmeeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that\nappraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall\ninclude in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock\ncorporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title.

Such demand will be sufficient if\nit reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder\nintends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the\nmerger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such\naction must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.

Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,\nshall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any\nstockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in\nthe case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation\nof the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice,\ndemand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e\nprovided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to\nan information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such\ndemand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and\nthat the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice\ndid not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such\nconstituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or\n(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or\nwithin 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more\nthan 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to\n\u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of\nthis title\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each\nstockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s\nshares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the\ntransfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given\nshall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of\ndetermining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in\nadvance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,\nprovided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the\nrecord date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the\neffective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on\nwhich the notice is given.\n(e)\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and\nwho is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be\nentitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the\ncase of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any\nexcluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered\ninto, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with\nrespect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such\nshares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request\nfor such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration\nof the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is\nlater. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such\nstock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own\nname, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the\nvalue of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall\nbe filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified\nlist. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the\nhearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published\nin the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the\nnotices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by\nthe surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who\nhave demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are\navailable were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all\nholders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)\nthe value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares\nexceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the\nshares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or\nconsolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest\nshall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any\nstockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to\ntrial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to\nsubsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the\nRegister in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined\nthat such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such\nstock. The Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,\nwhether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be\ncharged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k)\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided\nin subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting\ncorporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the\nmerger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as\nprovided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then\nthe right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal\nproceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the\nCourt, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however\nthat this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has\nB-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this\nsection.\n(l)\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nANNEX C",

Samuels\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nIn accordance with Section 6.18(c) of the Merger Agreement, entered into on April 11, 2021, by and among Microsoft\nCorporation, a Washington corporation (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d), Big Sky Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Microsoft (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and Nuance Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n(\u201cNuance\u201d), we have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in connection with the delivery of\nthe tax opinion described therein (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). This letter is being provided to you pursuant to that agreement.\nExcept as otherwise provided, all \u201cSection\u201d references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201cCode\u201d), and all \u201cTreasury Regulations Section\u201d references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the\nCode. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Opinion.\nAs used herein, \u201cknowledge of Nuance,\u201d means the actual knowledge of the undersigned, and the knowledge that\nthe undersigned would have reasonably obtained after due inquiry with respect to the particular matter in question.\nThe undersigned hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Nuance that, after due inquiry and investigation, the\nfollowing facts and representations are true, correct, and complete in all respects as of the date hereof.\n1.\nThe undersigned is familiar with the matters set forth in the Opinion, and has made such investigations of\nfactual matters as the undersigned deemed reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the representations,\ncovenants and statements therein.\n2.\nThe facts that are set forth in the section entitled \u201cBackground of the Merger and Reasons for the Merger\u201d in\nthe Registration Statement, which includes the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, as amended or supplemented through the date hereof (the \u201cForm S-4\u201d), insofar as such\nfacts pertain to Nuance or its representatives, are true, correct and complete in all material respects.\n3.\nBeginning in the fall of 2017, Nuance initiated a formal process (the \u201c2017 Sale Process\u201d) to evaluate potential\noffers for its automotive solutions business, specifically the business that would ultimately be spun off as\nCerence Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cCerence\u201d). The process included the engagement of Evercore Group\nL.L.C. (\u201cEvercore\u201d) as a sell side banker. The process resulted in an offer from a third party other than Microsoft\n(\u201cParty A\u201d) to acquire 51% of Cerence at a valuation of $1.35 billion. The process was put on hold on or around\nMarch 12, 2018 pending the leadership change at Nuance.\n4.\nDuring the summer of 2018, Evercore reengaged previously contacted and new potential investors (the \u201c2018\nSale Process\u201d). In total, considering both the 2017 Sale Process and the 2018 Sale Process, Evercore contacted\n41 parties, including Microsoft, in connection with the sale of this business. The 2018 Sale Process resulted in\nindications of interest from Party A as well as two other third parties other than Microsoft at valuation levels\ndeemed insufficient to proceed with a sale.\nA-A-1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n5.\nIn October, 2018, prior to the decision to spin off Nuance\u2019s automotive solutions business, Marc Brown, the\nthen Global Head of Corporate Development for Microsoft, was contacted regarding a potential minority\ninvestment in Nuance\u2019s automotive solutions business. Then, Marc Brown checked with Microsoft\u2019s relevant\nproduct team internally, and since no one had interest in exploring such investment, Microsoft did not further\npursue investment discussions.\n6.\nEfforts to sell an equity stake in Cerence highlighted that the valuation attributed to Cerence by the private\nmarket was likely lower than what could be achieved in the public market. By September, 2018, Nuance\nmanagement came to believe that separating Cerence via a spin-off would maximize long-term value creation to\nNuance\u2019s shareholders and given the corporate business purposes described below in representation 8.\n7.\nAt a September, 2018 board meeting, the Nuance board directed management to commence work in support of a\nrequest for the Nuance board\u2019s formal approval to proceed with a spin-off of Cerence. Neither the 2017 Sale\nProcess nor the 2018 Sale Process contemplated a sale of the entire business of Nuance.\n8.\nThe Distribution was undertaken for the following corporate business purposes:\na.\u2003Enhanced Strategic and Operational Focus. Following the Distribution, Nuance and Cerence would each\nhave a more focused business and would be better able to dedicate financial, management and other resources\nto their respective areas of strength and differentiation. Each company would pursue growth opportunities and\nexecute strategic plans best suited to address the distinct market trends and opportunities for its business.\nGiven that the Cerence business was the only Nuance business primarily focused on the automotive technology\nindustry, Cerence would be better positioned as an independent company to channel properly and fund\ninvestments and develop partnerships to capitalize on long-term industry trends. Cerence would focus on\nautomotive technology industry growth areas as well as continued operational excellence. The Nuance board\nbelieved that Cerence\u2019s separation from Nuance would allow Nuance to focus on the core growth opportunities\nin the remaining Nuance business.\nb.\u2003Simplified Organizational Structure and Resources. The Distribution would allow the management of each of\nNuance and Cerence to devote their time and attention to the development and implementation of corporate\nstrategies and policies that are based on the specific company\u2019s business characteristics. Each company would\nbe able to adapt faster to customers\u2019 changing needs, address specific market dynamics, target innovation and\ninvestments in select growth areas and accelerate decision-making processes.\nc.\u2003Distinct and Clear Financial Profiles and Compelling Investment Cases. Investment in one company or the\nother may appeal to investors with different goals, interests and concerns. The Distribution would allow\ninvestors to make independent investment decisions with respect to Nuance and Cerence and would result in\ngreater alignment between the interests of Cerence\u2019s stockholder base and the characteristics of Cerence\u2019s\nbusiness, capital structure and financial results.\nd.\u2003Performance Incentives. The Nuance board believed that the Distribution would enable Cerence to create\nincentives for its management and employees that would be more closely tied to its business performance and\nstockholder expectations. Cerence\u2019s equity-based compensation arrangements would more closely align the\ninterests of Cerence\u2019s management and employees with the interests of its stockholders and would increase\nCerence\u2019s ability to attract and retain personnel.\ne.\u2003Capital Structure. The Distribution would enable each of Nuance and Cerence to leverage its distinct growth\nprofile and cash flow characteristics to optimize its capital structure and capital allocation strategy.\n9.\nFollowing the September, 2018 board meeting, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) was engaged to\nadvise Nuance along with Evercore. Evercore and Goldman Sachs solicited a pre-spin minority investment in\nCerence from strategic investors and select financial sponsors. It was ultimately decided to proceed with a spin-\noff of Cerence to the public with no pre-spin minority investment in Cerence from a strategic investor or financial\nsponsor and all discussions with potential minority investors were terminated by November, 2018 and not\nresumed for the following reasons: (i) automotive technology peer trading multiples implied a higher public\nmarket valuation for Cerence than that attributed to a controlling equity stake in Cerence by financial sponsors\nor strategic investors, (ii) a spin-off could unlock value not then\nA-A-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreflected in the Nuance market valuation and (iii) a spin-off would create a public currency for Nuance to\nfacilitate management incentives and acquisitions. However, Nuance ultimately sold a 1.8% stake in Cerence on\nSeptember 30, 2019 in exchange for fair market value consideration to a non-strategic third-party investor.\n10.\nThe Distribution occurred on October 1, 2019. At that time, (i) Nuance had no plan or intention to approve, or\neffect, a transfer of any of its shares after the Distribution and (ii) Nuance had no current plan to redeem or\notherwise repurchase, directly or through any Affiliate, any of its outstanding stock, or rights to acquire stock,\nafter the Distribution, other than through purchases meeting the requirements of Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue\nProcedure 96-30 (without regard to the effect of Revenue Procedure 2003-48 on Revenue Procedure 96-30).\n11.\nTo the knowledge of Nuance, at the time of the Distribution there was no plan or intention on the part of any\nshareholder of Nuance, and neither the board nor the management of Nuance was aware of any plan or intention\non the part of any particular shareholder of Nuance, to dispose of any Nuance stock, other than in connection\nwith ordinary market trading.\n12.\nAt no time in the two years prior to the Distribution and for one year following the Distribution did any of\nNuance, any subsidiary in which Nuance owns a fifty percent or greater interest (together with Nuance, the\n\u201cNuance Group\u201d), any of their respective officers or directors, any person acting on behalf of the Nuance Group,\nor any person acting with the explicit or implicit permission, of any of the above (other than any person treated\nas acting with the implicit permission of Nuance solely in Nuance\u2019s capacity as a shareholder of such person\nand solely pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(9)) or, to the knowledge of Nuance, any five-\npercent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(8)) of Nuance or any group of\nshareholders together owning five-percent of Nuance, or any person acting on behalf of or with the explicit or\nimplicit permission of any five-percent Nuance shareholder, reach any agreement, understanding, or\narrangement, or conduct any substantial negotiations, each as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-\n7(h)(1), or discussions, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-7(h)(6), in each case with Microsoft,\nany Microsoft officer or director, any five-percent shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.355-\n7(h)(8)) of Microsoft, any group of shareholders together owning five-percent of Microsoft, or otherwise with\nany person acting on behalf of Microsoft or any five-percent Microsoft shareholder or any person acting with\nthe explicit or implicit permission of Microsoft or any five percent Microsoft shareholder, with respect to a\ntransaction or a proposed transaction pursuant to which any member of the Microsoft Group would (directly or\nindirectly) acquire, or have the right to acquire, the stock of Nuance or any interest in the assets that currently\nconstitute the Nuance business.\n13.\nAt no time since the date of the Distribution has Nuance been a disqualified investment corporation (within the\nmeaning of Section 355(g)(2) of the Code).\n14.\nThe potential acquisition by Microsoft of the stock of Nuance is not pursuant to an arrangement negotiated or\nagreed upon during any period before the Distribution, and no enforceable rights to acquire the stock of Nuance\nexisted during any period prior to the Distribution.\n15.\nThe total value of Microsoft\u2019s current offer to Nuance as of the date the Nuance board approved the\nTransaction was approximately $19.6 billion, computed on a fully-diluted basis, and accounting for payments to\nall Nuance equityholders in connection with the Transaction. Microsoft\u2019s current offer reflects a valuation of the\nNuance business that was not, and, in our view, could not have been, expected at the time of the Distribution.\n16.\nThe Transaction will be effected pursuant to, and in accordance with, the material terms and conditions of the\nMerger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been or will be waived or\nmodified. The facts relating to the Transaction as described in the Opinion and the documents referenced therein\nare true, correct, and complete in all material respects.\n17.\nUnless otherwise required by a court of competent jurisdiction, Nuance will not take (and will not cause its\nsubsidiaries to take) any position on any U.S. federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or any other\ntax reporting position, that is inconsistent with any statement or representation set forth in the Opinion or the\ntreatment of the Transaction described in the Opinion. We understand that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &\nGarrison LLP will rely, without further inquiry, on this representation letter in rendering its\nA-A-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinion in connection with the Transaction. We will promptly and timely inform you if, after signing this\nrepresentation letter, we have reason to believe that any of the facts described herein or any of the\nrepresentations made in this representation letter are or have become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any\nrespect.\n[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank]\nA-A-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, Nuance has executed this letter on this [ ]. day of [ ], 2021.\nNUANCE\nBy:\nName:\nTitle:\nA-A-5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXHIBIT B\nThis Exhibit B reflects the form of Parent Tax Representation Letter required to be delivered pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement as has been updated by Parent and the Company as of May 5, 2021.\nMicrosoft Corporation\nOne Microsoft Way\nRedmond, WA 98052\n[\u2022], 2021\nPRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP\n1285 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY 10019\nAttention: Jeffrey B.
