If the Merger Agreement Proposal is\napproved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into the Company, with the Company becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, the Company will\ncease to be a public company and you will cease to hold Vonage Common Stock or have any interest in the Company\u2019s future earnings or growth.\nIn addition, following the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no\nlonger file periodic reports with the SEC.\n \nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?\n \nA:\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder (as defined below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 64) who receives cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock in the Merger will\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock (that is, shares of Vonage Common Stock acquired for the same cost in a single transaction).\nNon-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Vonage Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such\nNon-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and\nforeign tax consequences of the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances (including with respect to any tax consequences to holders or\nbeneficial owners of options or other equity awards participating in the Merger or Transactions with respect to such options or equity awards) and\nany consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nA more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided below under the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 64.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen to outstanding Vonage equity compensation awards in the Merger?\n \nA:\nFor information regarding the treatment of outstanding Vonage Equity Awards, see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger\u2014\nTreatment of Equity Awards,\u201d beginning on page 70.\n \n14\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve each of the proposals?\n \nA:\nThe Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock\nentitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions, failures to vote and \u201cbroker non-votes\u201d will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nAgreement Proposal.\nThe approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Vonage Common Stock\npresent or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. Although the Board intends to consider the vote resulting\nfrom this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the\nMerger Agreement is adopted by Vonage stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved. Failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no\neffect on approval of the proposal\u037e however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal.\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the\naffirmative vote of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or represented by proxy\nat the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. In each case, failures to vote and\nbroker non-votes will have no effect on approval of the proposal\u037e however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal.\n \nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\n \nA:\nUpon careful consideration, the Board has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are in\nthe best interests of Vonage and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nNon-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement, please see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,\u201d beginning on page 40. In addition, in\nconsidering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive\nofficers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Vonage stockholders generally. See the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 54.\n \nQ:\nDo I need to attend the virtual Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nNo. It is not necessary for you to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock. If you are a stockholder of\nrecord as of the Record Date, you may vote by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, as described in more detail below. If you are a \u201cstreet\nname\u201d holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock, you must follow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other\nnominee for your shares of Vonage Common Stock to be voted at the Special Meeting, as described in more detail below.\n \nQ:\nHow many shares of Vonage Common Stock need to be represented at the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe presence at the Special Meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. As of the Record\nDate, there were 254,037,958\n \n15\nTable of Contents\n \nshares of Vonage Common Stock outstanding. If you are a Vonage stockholder as of the close of business on the Record Date and you vote by\nmail, by telephone, through the Internet or at the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you\nare a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions,\nthen your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of\nVonage Common Stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.\nAll shares of Vonage Common Stock held by stockholders that attend the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website, or represented by proxy,\nand entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, regardless of how such shares of Vonage Common Stock are voted or whether such stockholders have\nindicated on their proxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum,\nthe Special Meeting may be adjourned.\n \nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nVonage\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?\n \nA:\nIn July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid\nor become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In\naccordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Vonage is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a\nnon-binding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Vonage\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cProposal 2: Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal,\u201d beginning on page 30.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if Vonage stockholders do not approve the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal?\n \nA:\nThe vote to approve the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nApproval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only,\nmeaning that it will not be binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by\nVonage\u2019s stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our\nnamed executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.\n \nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\n \nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this proxy statement, please\nvote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share\nof Vonage Common Stock that you owned on the Record Date.\n \nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?\n \nA:\nYou may vote by:\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the enclosed prepaid\nenvelope\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e\n \n16\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n submitting your proxy through the Internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n casting your vote at the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website. Any stockholder can attend the Special Meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VG2022SM, where stockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote online. The Special\nMeeting starts at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time. Please have your control number to join the Special Meeting. Instructions on how to attend and\nparticipate online are also posted online at www.proxyvote.com.\nIf you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on the\nday before the Special Meeting.\nSubmitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet will not prevent you from voting at the Special Meeting. You are encouraged\nto submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting to ensure that your shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock are represented at the Special Meeting.\nIf you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be\nvoted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal, and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n \nQ:\nIf my shares of Vonage Common Stock are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee\nvote those shares of Vonage Common Stock for me with respect to the proposals?\n \nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock at the Special Meeting unless you\nprovide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on\nhow to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or\nother nominee. You may be able to vote by telephone or through the Internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.\n \nQ:\nWhat if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?\n \nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock unless you have properly instructed your\nbank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority\nof the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter, the failure to provide your nominee with voting instructions\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal. Furthermore, your shares of Vonage Common Stock will not be\nincluded in the calculation of the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum is present.\n \nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the Internet?\n \nA:\nYes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering\na signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to Vonage\u2019s Corporate\nSecretary at 23 Main Street, Holmdel, NJ 07733. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by submitting another proxy by telephone or\nthrough the Internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-dated proxy card relating to the\nsame shares of Vonage Common Stock. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain a\ncopy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or\n \n17\nTable of Contents\n \nchange your vote by telephone or through the Internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the Special Meeting and\nvoting via the virtual meeting website. However, simply attending the Special Meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. \u201cStreet\nname\u201d holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to\nrevoke or change their proxies.\nIf you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock, you must follow the instructions\nreceived from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.\nAll properly submitted proxies received by us before the Special Meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the Special\nMeeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,\n\u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals.\n \nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?\n \nA:\nIf you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Vonage Common Stock that are registered in more than one account. For\nexample, if you own your shares of Vonage Common Stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as\ncustodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Vonage Common Stock\nbecause they are held in a different form of record ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Vonage Common Stock are voted, you\nwill need to submit your proxies by mailing in each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the Internet by using the different voter\ncontrol number(s) on each proxy card.\n \nQ:\nWhat is \u201chouseholding\u201d and how does it affect me?\n \nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,\nunless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the Company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,\neach stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation and reduces printing and mailing expenses. We have not instituted householding for stockholders of record\u037e however, certain\nbrokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Vonage Common Stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has\nmultiple accounts holding Vonage Common Stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your\nbroker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate\ncopy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and\nthereby receive multiple copies.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Vonage Common Stock before the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the expected date of the Merger. If you own shares of Vonage Common Stock as of the close\nof business on the Record Date but transfer your shares of Vonage Common Stock prior to the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote at\nthe Special Meeting, but the right to receive $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock, in cash, net of any applicable withholding taxes and\nwithout interest will pass to the person who holds your shares of Vonage Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.\n \nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\n \nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under\nDelaware law, holders of record of Vonage Common Stock who do not\n \n18\nTable of Contents\n \nvote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be available to these holders if they deliver a\nwritten demand for an appraisal to Vonage prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting and they comply with the\nprocedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be\nmore than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of\nSection 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d\nbeginning on page 99.\n \nQ:\nIf I hold my shares of Vonage Common Stock in certificated form, should I send in my Certificates now?\n \nA:\nNo. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written instructions on how to return your\nCertificates. You must return your Certificates in accordance with such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration. PLEASE DO\nNOT SEND IN YOUR CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.\n \nQ:\nShould I send in my Company Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Restricted Stock Units now?\n \nA:\nNo. Shortly after the Merger is completed, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, your Company Options, Restricted Stock Units, and\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units will either be automatically exchanged for the applicable consideration, or you will receive further instructions\nfor such exchange. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger\u2014Treatment of Equity Awards,\u201d\nbeginning on page 70.\n \nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\n \nA:\nWe and Parent are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during\nthe first half of 2022, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The\nMerger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by Vonage stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\u2014Conditions to the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 92.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\n \nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote\non the matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your\nshares of Vonage Common Stock. Instead, Vonage will remain a public company, and Vonage Common Stock will continue to be registered under the\nExchange Act and listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is\nbeing operated today and that holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which\nthey are currently subject with respect to their ownership of Vonage Common Stock. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed,\nwe may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee.\nFor additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,\u201d beginning on page 64.\n \n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nAre there any requirements if I plan on attending the Special Meeting?\n \nA:\nThe Special Meeting will be held via a live webcast only.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board, together with the Company\u2019s management and the assistance of the Company\u2019s advisors, regularly reviews and assesses the\nCompany\u2019s strategic direction, financial performance and business plans with a view towards strengthening the Company\u2019s business and identifying\nopportunities to increase stockholder value, taking into account financial, industry, competitive and other considerations. As part of this periodic review\nand assessment, from time to time during the two-year period prior to the contacts and process resulting in the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger\nAgreement described below, the Board and the Company\u2019s management considered potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions and\ndivestitures, and engaged in business development and strategic discussions with other participants in the industry in order to complement and expand\nthe Company\u2019s existing business and operations. None of these prior discussions progressed beyond preliminary phases, including with respect to the\nCompany\u2019s previously announced plans in February 2020 to explore the sale of its Consumer business segment (which plans were subsequently\nterminated in February 2021), other than as described below.\nIn connection with the foregoing, on February 11, 2021, the Board approved the formation of a transactions committee (the \u201cTransactions\nCommittee\u201d), to be comprised of three independent members of the Board (Jeffrey Citron, the Chairman of the Board, Hamid Akhavan and Michael\nMcConnell), to assist the Board in its oversight of the Company\u2019s transaction strategies and to review, assess and recommend transactions proposed by\nthe Company\u2019s management in connection with the Company\u2019s growth plan.\nOn May 6, 2021, a consortium comprised of two financial sponsors (together, \u201cParty A\u201d) delivered to Mr. Citron and Rory Read, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of the Company, an unsolicited proposal for the acquisition of the Company at a price of $16.25 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash (the\n\u201cParty A Proposal\u201d), which proposal was based solely on publicly available information about the Company and was subject to Party A\u2019s further due\ndiligence. Representatives of the Company previously had engaged in discussions with representatives of one member of Party A in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s prior exploration of a sale of its Consumer business segment, and subsequently regarding business development and strategic opportunities\nthat were unrelated to the acquisition of the Company. None of these prior discussions progressed beyond preliminary phases.\nOn May 7, 2021, a representative of the Company contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners LP (\u201cQatalyst Partners\u201d) to discuss the Company\nengaging Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor in connection with the Party A Proposal.\nOn May 15, 2021, the Board held a meeting, attended by the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil, Gotshal &\nManges LLP (\u201cWeil\u201d), legal counsel to the Company, to review and\n \n32Table of Contents\ndiscuss the Party A Proposal. Representatives of Weil reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties as directors generally and in\nconnection with their review of the Party A Proposal. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company should conduct further analyses,\nwith the assistance of its advisors, to assist the Board in reviewing and determining a course of action in connection with the Party A Proposal. The\nBoard, based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation, and its knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and the industry in which the\nCompany operates, directed the Company\u2019s management to retain Qatalyst Partners as the Company\u2019s financial advisor (subject to negotiating an\nacceptable engagement letter) and instructed Qatalyst Partners to prepare preliminary financial analyses of the Party A Proposal and of the Company\u2019s\nstandalone value, for review with the Board at a meeting to be scheduled at a later date.\nOn May 16, 2021, a representative of the Company contacted Party A to convey that the Board was working to retain a financial advisor and that it\nwas evaluating the Party A Proposal.\nOn May 17, 2021, JANA Partners, LLC (\u201cJANA\u201d) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 13F reflecting an ownership in the\nCompany of 5,803,478 shares of Vonage Common Stock as of March 31, 2021, constituting approximately 2.3% of the then-outstanding shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock. On the same day, the media reported that JANA had acquired such ownership, that it believed the Company to be undervalued and\nintended to advocate for changes at the Company.\nOn May 27, 2021, the Company entered into an engagement letter with Qatalyst Partners formalizing the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to act as\nthe Company\u2019s financial advisor to, among other things, assist the Company in evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company, including a possible\nsale of the Company.\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, the Transactions Committee and the Board held numerous meetings to discuss the Party A Proposal, at certain of\nwhich members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil participated.\nOn June 7, 2021, the Board held a meeting, attended by the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil, at which,\namong other things, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board certain preliminary financial considerations with respect to the Party A\nProposal.

Following discussion, the Board determined\nthat, based on the Company\u2019s prospects and financial performance, the analyses presented by the Company\u2019s management and its advisors and the\nBoard\u2019s discussions to date, it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders not to accept the Party A Proposal. The Board also\ndetermined that the Company should continue to engage with Party A and directed Qatalyst Partners to inform Party A that it would consider an offer\nprice above $20.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock and would allow Party A to engage in further due diligence with respect to a potential transaction.\nOn June 14, 2021, the Company sent Party A a letter responding to the Party A Proposal, noting that the Board had determined that the Company\nwould continue to operate as a stand-alone company and execute on its current strategy and growth plan.\nOn June 15, 2021, Qatalyst Partners advised Party A that the Board would be willing to engage with Party A with respect to a potential transaction if\nParty A would consider increasing its offer price above $20.00 per share\n \n33\nTable of Contents\nof Vonage Common Stock.

It was agreed that the Board should be updated on the potential increase in Party A\u2019s offer at its next meeting.\nOn July 28, 2021, Mr. Read was contacted on an unsolicited basis by a financial sponsor (\u201cParty B\u201d) to discuss potential partnering and investment\nopportunities with the Company, including a strategic transaction.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Weil, at which, among other things, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the potential increase in Party A\u2019s\noffer to a range of between approximately $17.00 to $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock and Mr. Read updated the Board on the outreach by Party\nB.\nOn August 6, 2021, the Company received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from a financial sponsor (\u201cParty C\u201d) for the acquisition of the\nCompany at a price of $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash (the \u201cParty C Proposal\u201d), which proposal was based solely on publicly\navailable information about the Company and was subject to Party C\u2019s further due diligence.\nOn August 8, 2021, representatives of the Company\u2019s management and Qatalyst Partners met to discuss the Party C Proposal and the feedback\nprovided by Party A regarding a potential increase to its offer price. Representatives of the Company directed Qatalyst Partners to instruct Party A that\nits proposed potential increase to its offer price was still inadequate, and that while the Board remained open to considering an enhanced revised offer\nfrom Party A above $20.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock, other parties had also expressed interest in a strategic transaction with the Company. On\nAugust 9, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Party A to convey such message.\nOn August 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Party C and confirmed that the Board was reviewing the\nParty C Proposal.

After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best\ninterest of the Company and its stockholders to initiate a process to explore a potential sale of the Company. As part of this process, the Board authorized\nQatalyst Partners and the Company\u2019s management to continue discussions with Party A, Party B and Party C and to contact other parties that might be\ninterested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company and able to provide an attractive offer price. The Board also directed Qatalyst Partners to\ninstruct Party C that while the Board was authorizing the Company to engage in further discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with Party\nC once it had entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, Party C would need to meaningfully improve its proposal for the Board to\nconsider a potential strategic transaction with Party C. The Board further directed Qatalyst Partners to instruct Party C that it could continue to do\nadditional due diligence on the Company, but there was interest from other parties in a potential strategic transaction with the Company.\nOn August 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with representatives of Party A and informed Party A that the Company had\nreceived interest from other parties regarding a possible strategic transaction and that the Board had determined to solicit additional parties regarding a\npossible strategic transaction with the Company and asked whether Party A was still interested in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company.\nRepresentatives of Party A confirmed Party A\u2019s continued interest in a potential transaction with the Company.\nAlso on August 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with representatives of Party C regarding the Party C Proposal to convey the\nmessage provided by the Board at the prior meeting on August 26, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company received a revised, unsolicited non-binding proposal from Party A for the acquisition of the Company at a price\nof $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, subject to Party A conducting customary due diligence.\nAlso on August 31, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting that JANA was encouraging the Company to explore strategic alternatives,\nincluding the sale of all or a portion of the Company\u2019s business.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Transactions Committee met with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil to\ndiscuss the process to explore a potential sale of the Company. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Transactions Committee authorized Qatalyst\nPartners to begin contacting parties, including Parent, that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company and able to provide\nan attractive offer price. During the month of September 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of the Company, conducted a broad\noutreach to potential parties, which together with inbound contacts, resulted in Qatalyst Partners engaging with 30 parties, including Parent, regarding a\npotential strategic transaction with the Company. Of the 30 parties, the Company signed confidentiality agreements with a total of 13 parties (including\none strategic party that already had a pre-existing confidentiality agreement related to such party\u2019s commercial relationship with the Company), comprised\nof four strategic companies (including Parent) and nine financial sponsors (including Party A, Party B and Party C), and each confidentiality agreement\n(other than the pre-existing confidentiality agreement) included a customary standstill provision (which standstill provision permitted the counterparty to\nmake non-public proposals to the Company that would not require public disclosure). Other parties that Qatalyst Partners contacted declined to\nparticipate in the process for a variety of reasons, including competing priorities, no interest in certain of the Company\u2019s business segments, the financial\nprofile of certain of the Company\u2019s business segments and/or overlap with existing businesses.\nEach party that signed a confidentiality agreement was provided access to certain non-public materials regarding the Company\u2019s business and\noperations and a call with members of the Company\u2019s management team.\n \n35\nTable of Contents\nBetween September 2021 and November 2021, members of the Company\u2019s management team held management presentations and subsequent diligence\nsessions with 13 parties, including Parent, at certain of which representatives of Qatalyst Partners participated.\nOn September 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Parent had an initial call regarding a potential strategic transaction with the\nCompany.\nOn September 21, 2021, Parent executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which included a customary standstill provision (which\nOn September 21, 2021, Parent executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which included a customary standstill provision (which\nstandstill provision permitted Parent to make non-public proposals to the Company that would not require public disclosure).\nBeginning on September 22, 2021, the Company and Parent engaged in a due diligence process as part of which the Company shared certain non-\npublic information regarding the Company with Parent to assist with Parent\u2019s evaluation and review of a potential transaction. During this process, the\nCompany\u2019s management team and representatives of Parent, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (\u201cFreshfields\u201d), legal counsel to Parent, and\nGoldman Sachs International (\u201cGoldman\u201d), financial advisor to Parent, held numerous due diligence meetings on subject areas such as finance, strategy,\nproduct and technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate,\nsanctions and compliance. Also during this period, Mr. Read and Mr. Borje Ekholm, the Chief Executive Officer of Parent, as well as other representatives\nof the Company, Parent and their respective advisors, had various telephone conferences and meetings to discuss the potential transaction.\nBetween September 24, 2021 and October 5, 2021, six of the parties that signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings\nwith the Company, including Party C, declined to proceed with a potential transaction with the Company for a variety of reasons, including the margin\nprofile of certain of the Company\u2019s business segments, the Company\u2019s technology and competitive landscape, competing priorities and/or no interest in\none or more of the Company\u2019s business segments and the inability to justify valuation levels that would support a proposal consistent with expectations\nviewed as adequate by the Board to move forward in the process.\nOn October 5, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners delivered a process letter to the seven remaining parties (comprised of two strategic\ncompanies and five financial sponsors) that had signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings with the Company, including\nParent, Party A and Party B, requesting that each party submit a non-binding written proposal with respect to a strategic transaction with the Company\nno later than October 18, 2021.\nOn October 18, 2021, representatives of each of Parent and Party A indicated to Qatalyst Partners that they would be submitting non-binding\nproposals but would need an additional day.\nOn October 19, 2021, Parent submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire all of the shares of Vonage Common Stock for a purchase price of\nbetween $20.50 to $22.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, subject to Parent\u2019s confirmatory due diligence. Parent\u2019s proposal represented a 52%\nto 63% premium to the price per share of Vonage Common Stock as of August 30, 2021, the last closing price prior to the Bloomberg article discussed\nabove, of $13.50, and a 34% to 43% premium to the Company\u2019s 52-week high price per share of Vonage Common Stock prior to August 30, 2021, of $15.35.\nAs part of its proposal, Parent indicated that at the appropriate time it would like to discuss with the Company\u2019s management team and other key\nemployees post-closing employment opportunities and arrangements\u037e such discussions did not commence until November 15, 2021, as discussed below.\nIn addition, Parent indicated in its proposal a readiness to work on an accelerated basis to announce a transaction as soon as possible.\nAlso on October 19, 2021, the Company received a written non-binding proposal from Party A to acquire the Company\u2019s Consumer business\nsegment and UC/CC business segment (i.e., the Company\u2019s business other\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nthan the API business segment) for aggregate consideration of between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in cash, subject to Party A\u2019s confirmatory due diligence.\nParty A\u2019s proposal also stated that it would be willing to make a \u201cmeaningful\u201d cash investment into the Company\u2019s remaining business following such\nproposed sale transaction (i.e., the API business segment).\nOther than the proposals from Party A and Parent, the strategic review process did not result in any other proposals with respect to a strategic\ntransaction with the Company, including from Party B. The parties that declined to submit a proposal determined to do so for a variety of reasons,\nincluding the margin profile of certain of the Company\u2019s business segments, the Company\u2019s technology and competitive landscape, competing priorities\nand/or no interest in one or more of the Company\u2019s business segments.\nOn October 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nWeil, at which, among other things, the Board received an update on the process to explore strategic alternatives and representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nreviewed with the Board a financial overview and preliminary valuation considerations with respect to the proposals from Parent and Party A,\nrespectively. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that (i) it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to prioritize\nthe evaluation of a potential transaction with Parent as compared to any other potential transaction, including the proposal from Party A, which the Board\nfound unattractive due to the inadequate valuation and the fact that the offer was for less than all of the Company, and (ii) to pursue a potential\ntransaction with Parent. As a result of this determination, the Board directed the Company\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors to proceed\nwith negotiations with Parent regarding a potential transaction.\nOn October 21, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of the Company, contacted representatives of Goldman to inform them that the\nCompany would consider transacting at the top end of Parent\u2019s indicated range of $20.50 to $22.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock if a definitive\nagreement could be finalized expeditiously. Mr. Read also called Mr. Ekholm to convey the same message.\nLater in the day on October 21, 2021, representatives of Weil sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Freshfields.\nFrom October 21, 2021 through November 21, 2021, representatives of the Company, Parent and their respective advisors, had various telephone\nconferences and meetings to discuss Parent\u2019s continued due diligence of the Company on the topics of, among other things, finance, strategy, product\nand technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate, sanctions\nand compliance, as well as the potential transaction in general. During such period, the Company\u2019s management team periodically provided updates to\nmembers of the Board regarding the potential transaction with Parent.\nOn October 27, 2021, representatives of Freshfields provided representatives of Weil with their initial comments to Weil\u2019s draft of the Merger\nAgreement. From October 27, 2021 through November 21, 2021, the Company, Parent and their respective legal advisors negotiated the Merger\nAgreement and related transaction documents. Significant areas of discussion and negotiation included: (i) the level of conditionality in the Merger\nAgreement, including with respect to domestic and foreign regulatory filings\u037e (ii) the treatment and vesting of the Company\u2019s equity awards\u037e (iii)\nregulatory efforts standards and the standard for possible divestitures or other remedies in connection with applicable antitrust and foreign investment\nlaws\u037e (iv) the termination fees payable by the Company or Parent, as applicable, in certain circumstances\u037e and (v) the scope of the representations and\nwarranties and covenants of the parties.\nOn October 29, 2021, a representative of Goldman Sachs called a representative of Qatalyst Partners to discuss the potential transaction and\nindicated that Parent would potentially be in a position to provide an updated indication of price on November 8, 2021 or November 9, 2021.\n \n37\nTable of Contents\nOn November 8, 2021, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a telephone conversation with a representative of Parent during which Parent\nstated that Parent would only be in a position to provide an updated indication of price after an upcoming Parent board meeting.

Mr. Read informed Mr. Ekholm that the Board\nwould need to consider the proposal\u037e however, he indicated that it was likely that the proposal would be deemed inadequate by the Board considering\nthat it was below the purchase price range previously communicated by Parent and inconsistent with the guidance provided by the Company to Parent\npreviously. Later that day, Mr. Ekholm called Mr. Read and increased Parent\u2019s offer to acquire all of the shares of Vonage Common Stock to $20.50 per\nshare of Vonage Common Stock in cash.

At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board a financial overview of Parent\u2019s revised proposal and representatives\nof Weil reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the\nCompany and its stockholders to continue negotiations with Parent and to submit a counter-proposal for $21.50 per share of Vonage Common Stock in\ncash, but that ultimately the Board would be willing to accept a purchase price of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash and that the\nCompany\u2019s management was authorized to proceed on that basis.\nFollowing the Board meeting on November 13, 2021, Mr. Read spoke with Mr. Ekholm and conveyed the counter-proposal of $21.50 per share of\nVonage Common Stock in cash.

        "Section Text": "Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement\nIn arriving at its unanimous determination and recommendation at the November 21, 2021 meeting (please see above under the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Recommendation of the Board\u201d), the Board reviewed and discussed a significant amount of information and consulted with the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, legal advisor and financial advisor. The following are some of the significant factors that supported its decision to approve the Merger\nAgreement (not necessarily in order of relative importance) and the Transactions, including the Merger:\n \n \n\u2022\n Cash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that, the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and enables the Company\u2019s\nstockholders to realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution risk. Specifically,\namong other things, the Board considered:\n \n \n\u2022\n The fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for the Company\u2019s stockholders, including:\n \n \n\u2022\n \na premium of 56% to the Company\u2019s closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on August 30, 2021 (the last trading\nday prior to the Bloomberg article reporting that JANA was encouraging the Company to explore strategic alternatives) of\n$13.50 per share of Vonage Common Stock, and a premium of 37% to the Company\u2019s 52-week high closing price per share of\nVonage Common Stock prior to August 30, 2021 of $15.35 per share of Vonage Common Stock\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n \na premium of 28% to the Company\u2019s closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on November 19, 2021 (the last trading\nday prior to the Board\u2019s approval of the Merger Agreement) of $16.37 per share of Vonage Common Stock, and a premium of\n34% to the volume-weighted average price per share of Vonage Common Stock over the three-month period ended\nNovember 19, 2021 of $15.71 per share of Vonage Common Stock\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n \na premium of 21% to the Company\u2019s all-time high closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on November 5, 2021 of\n$17.35 per share of Vonage Common Stock.\n \n \n\u2022\n The trading history of the Company and the Merger Consideration relative to such history.\n \n \n\u2022\n The belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that Parent was willing to pay considering the negotiations\nbetween the parties.\n \n \n40Table of Contents\n \n\u2022\n Prospects of the Company.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration compares favorably to the potential long-term value of the Company if\nthe Company were to remain as a stand-alone entity after taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with this\nalternative, including the Company\u2019s historical and projected business, competitive position within the industry and current market\nand financial conditions.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the possibility of continuing to operate the Company as a stand-alone entity and the desirability and perceived\nrisks of continuing to execute on its business plan, the potential benefits to the Company\u2019s stockholders of this alternative and the\ntime horizon required for the business plan to yield improved financial and market performance by the Company.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the Company\u2019s standalone business plan, financial forecasts and the risks associated with the Company\u2019s\nability to execute on and achieve such business plan and forecasts, including execution risks associated with implementing planned-\non initiatives across new partnerships and product introductions, sales efforts and business transformations.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the significant financial investments that would be required to execute on its business plan, including the\ntiming thereof.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the fact that pursuing a strategic process whereby the different business segments of the Company are sold in\nseparate transactions would not be reasonably likely to create greater value for the Company\u2019s stockholders than the Merger after\ntaking into account (i) the Board\u2019s view of the separate value of the businesses of the Company as compared to the value of the\ncombined Company, (ii) the execution risk, business, competitive, industry and market risk, tax implications and transaction costs\nassociated with pursuing such a process, and (iii) the substantial time and effort required of the Company\u2019s management to complete\nmultiple sale transactions, which could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from the operation of the Company\u2019s business,\nincluding other strategic opportunities and operational matters.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered certain industry trends and the potential risks and volatility associated with these developments, including\ncompanies increasing competition in the market.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered the fact that certain investments in and acquisitions of unaffiliated third parties were contemplated as part of\nthe business plan and in that regard considered the potential of limited opportunities on financially attractive terms.\n \n \n\u2022\n The Sale Process:\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered that after receiving unsolicited indications of interest from three parties, the Board commenced a sale process\nand, together with the assistance of Qatalyst Partners, communicated with 30 potential strategic and financial sponsor parties it\nbelieved most likely and capable of acquiring the Company (as described above in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d).\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered that of the 30 parties contacted, 13 entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company (including one\nparty that already had a pre-existing confidentiality agreement).\n \n \n\u2022\n The Board considered that Parent\u2019s offer of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock was the only final offer received to acquire the\nentire Company at the conclusion of the Company\u2019s process of exploring strategic alternatives.\n \n \n\u2022\n Negotiation Process. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were the\nresult of robust arm\u2019s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge and at the direction of the Board, and with the\nassistance of an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel.\n \n \n41\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n Opinion of Financial Advisors. The Board considered the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect\nthat, as of November 21, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such\nwritten opinion, the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any\naffiliate of Parent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,\u201d which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this\nproxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.\n \n \n\u2022\n Non-Price Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the non-price terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:\n \n \n\u2022\n the provision allowing the Board to make a Change in Recommendation prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote in specified\ncircumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, subject to Parent\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and\nreceive payment of a termination fee in the amount of $200 million\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive written\nAlternative Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including certain rights of\nParent to match the Superior Proposal and the prior or concurrent payment to Parent of a termination fee of $200 million) if Parent is\nunable to or declines to match the terms of a Superior Proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the provision requiring Parent to pay the Company a termination fee of $200 million, if the Company or Parent terminate the Merger\nAgreement under specified circumstances in connection with a failure to obtain CFIUS Clearance\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the absence of any financing condition to the consummation of the Merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that the Merger is not subject to approval of Parent\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Parent\u2019s obligation under the Merger Agreement to use its best efforts (as defined below in \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger\u2014\nEfforts to Complete the Merger\u201d) to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper\nor advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable laws and orders to consummate and make effective the Merger and the\nother Transactions as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date\u037e provided, that Parent will not have\nany obligation to propose, undertake or agree to any such actions if such actions would reasonably be expected to, individually or in\nthe aggregate with all such other actions, result in a Substantial Detriment (as defined below in \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger\u2014\nEfforts to Complete the Merger\u201d)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the Company\u2019s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement.\n \n \n\u2022\n Opportunity for the Company\u2019s Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders, and the Company\u2019s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\n \n \n\u2022\n Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and the\nstructure of the Merger and concluded that the Transactions, including the Merger, could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an\norderly manner. The Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period\nduring which the Company\u2019s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.\n \n \n42\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n Availability of Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to the Company\u2019s\nstockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise comply with all of the required\nprocedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have the Court of Chancery\nof the State of Delaware determine the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock, which may be more than, the same as or less than\nthe Merger Consideration.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Transactions,\nincluding:\n \n \n\u2022\n No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all cash\ntransaction means that the Company would no longer exist as an independent public company following the consummation of the Merger\nand that the Company\u2019s stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will not benefit from any appreciation in\nvalue of the Surviving Corporation.\n \n \n\u2022\n Closing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to\nconsummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\n \n \n\u2022\n Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the Transactions, including the Merger,\nmight not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:\n \n \n\u2022\n the Company\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have\nexperienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transactions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the Company\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers, suppliers, business partners and employees may be adversely\naffected\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the trading price of shares of Vonage Common Stock could be materially and adversely affected\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the market\u2019s perceptions of the Company\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected.\n \n \n\u2022\n No Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement precludes\nthe Company from soliciting or entertaining alternative acquisition proposals and requires the Company to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$200 million in certain circumstances, including if the Board terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition\nAgreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.\n \n \n\u2022\n Effects of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the effect of the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, including\neffects on the Company\u2019s stock price, and the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the\nTransactions, as well as the potential for legal proceedings, judgments or settlements following the announcement of the Transactions and\nthe associated costs, burden and inconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and settlements.\n \n \n\u2022\n Timing Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that completion of the Merger\ndepends on factors outside of the Company\u2019s or Parent\u2019s control (including the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s\nstockholders), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the execution of\nthe Merger Agreement could divert the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and have an adverse impact on the Company, including its\ncustomer, supplier and other business relationships.\n \n43\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n Taxable Consideration. The Board considered the fact that the exchange of Vonage Common Stock for cash in the Merger generally will be\na taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n \n \n\u2022\n Other Risks. The Board considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in\nour annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 incorporated by reference herein and the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers\nhave interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests\nand considered them at the time it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the Company\u2019s stockholders. See the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors\nconsidered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not,\nquantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual\ndirectors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what\nextent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its recommendation on\nthe totality of the information presented, including the factors described above.",

        "Section Text": "Miscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any\nparticular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all\nanalyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of Vonage. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Vonage\u2019s\n \n53Table of Contents\ncontrol. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This\nanalysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Vonage Common Stock might actually trade at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the Board in deciding to approve the Merger\nAgreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger\nconsideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the\nterms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), or of whether the Board\nwould have been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without\ninterest thereon, payable in the Merger was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Vonage and Parent and was unanimously approved\nby the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Vonage during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific\nconsideration to Vonage or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from\nwhich conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Vonage, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.\nDuring the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates\nand Vonage or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the\nfuture provide investment banking and other financial services to Vonage or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would\nexpect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provided Vonage with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid\napproximately $73 million, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter and $5 million of which was payable upon the\ndelivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the\nconsummation of the Merger. Vonage has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Vonage has\nalso agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any\nperson controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain\nexpenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.",

As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, Vonage will continue\nto exist following the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.\nFollowing the Merger, all of Vonage\u2019s equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Parent, and none of Vonage\u2019s current stockholders\nwill, by virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, Vonage, the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the completion of\nthe Merger. As a result, Vonage\u2019s current stockholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in\nthe value, of Vonage Common Stock. Following the Merger, Parent will benefit from any increase in Vonage\u2019s enterprise value and also will bear the risk of\nany decrease in Vonage\u2019s enterprise value.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each share of Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than\nExcluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled, will cease to exist and will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration, net of any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.

In addition, the registration of shares of\nVonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Vonage will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC\nwith respect to Vonage Common Stock. Termination of registration of Vonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required\nto be furnished by Vonage to Vonage\u2019s stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file\nannual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange\nAct and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders\u2019 meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer\napplicable to Vonage to the extent that they apply solely as a result of the registration of Vonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act.\n \n63Table of Contents",

        "Section Text": "Filing a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred and twenty (120) days after the completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation (which, in this case,\nwill be Vonage), or any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 of the DGCL, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on Vonage in\nthe case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair\n \n100Table of Contents\nvalue of the shares of Vonage Common Stock held by all holders who did not adopt the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares of\nVonage Common Stock. If no such petition is filed within that one hundred and twenty (120)-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all dissenting\nstockholders. Vonage is under no obligation to, and has no present intention to, file a petition, and holders should not assume that Vonage will file a\npetition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Vonage Common Stock. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the\nholders of shares of Vonage Common Stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares of Vonage Common\nStock within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin one hundred and twenty (120) days after the completion of the Merger, any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who has complied\nwith the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting\nforth the aggregate number of shares of Vonage Common Stock not voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal have\nbeen received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares of Vonage Common Stock. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a\nwritten request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands\nfor appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of shares\nof Vonage Common Stock, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Vonage Common Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf\nof such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for\nappraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nUpon the filing of such petition by any such holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the\nSurviving Corporation, which will then obligate the Surviving Corporation to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file with the Register in\nChancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Register in Chancery\u201d) a duly verified list (the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing\nthe names and addresses of all such stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and with whom agreements as\nto the value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may\norder the Delaware Register in Chancery to provide notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving\nCorporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a\nnewspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nThe costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the\npetition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder.\nThe Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and who hold shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of\nthe appraisal proceeding, and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that\nstockholder.",

        "Section Header": "Determination of Fair Value",
        "Section Text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in\naccordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding,\nthe Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Court\nof Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good\n \n101Table of Contents\ncause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent\n(5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and\nthe date of payment of the judgment.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., 457 A.2d 701 (Del.\n1983), the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that\n\u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered and that \u201cfair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware\nSupreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects\nof the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345 (Del. 1993), the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a\n\u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from\nsuch accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock as so determined could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nconsideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL the completion of the Merger. Although Vonage believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of\nthe appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 262 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor Vonage anticipates\noffering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and Parent and Vonage reserve the right to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of Vonage Common Stock is less than the Merger\nConsideration.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders\nentitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock whose name appears on the Verified List and, if such shares of Vonage Common\nStock are represented by certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery,\nmay participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will\ndirect the payment of the fair value of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, together with interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and, in the case\nof holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock represented by Certificates, upon the surrender to the Surviving Corporation of such stockholder\u2019s\nCertificates. The Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the action (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and imposed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order\nall or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019\nfees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of Vonage\nCommon Stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of an order, each party bears its own expenses.\n \n102\nTable of Contents\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal rights for shares of Vonage Common Stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not,\nafter the Effective Time, be entitled to vote such shares of Vonage Common Stock for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other\ndistributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of Vonage Common Stock as of a date or time prior to\nthe Effective Time.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger has become effective to each\nstockholder that has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the Merger. At any time within sixty (60) days after the\nEffective Time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal only with the consent of Vonage. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within one\nhundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, stockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal will cease, and all holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock\nwill be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In as much as Vonage has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so,\nany holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who desires such a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal by delivering to Vonage a written withdrawal of its demand for appraisal and acceptance of the Merger\nConsideration, except that (i) any such attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of Vonage\nand (ii) no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of\nChancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.\nIf you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in favor of the Merger, and you must comply\nwith the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it will\nresult in the termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of Vonage stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not purport to be a complete\nstatement of the procedures to be followed by Vonage stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nFailure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal\nrights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your\nappraisal rights.\n \n103\nTable of Contents",

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,\nsettlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not\nact in good faith and in a\n \nA-71\nTable of Contents\n \nmanner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any\ncriminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.\n \n \nb)\nActions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or\nthreatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a\njudgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is\nor was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee\nof, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit\nplan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director,\nofficer, partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee, against all expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) and, to the extent permitted by law,\namounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or\nproceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or\nnot opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this paragraph (b) in respect of\nany claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent,\nthat the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite\nthe adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity\nfor such expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.\n \n \nc)\nIndemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article VIII, to the extent that an Indemnitee\nhas been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this\nArticle VIII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be\nindemnified against all expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection\ntherewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition\nwithout prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the\nCorporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a\nmanner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal\nproceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for\nthe purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.\n \n \nd)\nNotification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee\u2019s right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the\nCorporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity\nwill or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the\nCorporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal\ncounsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense,\nthe Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with\nsuch action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this paragraph (d). Indemnitee shall have the right to employ\nhis or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel\nincurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the\nemployment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded\nthat there may be a conflict of\n \nA-72\nTable of Contents\n \ninterest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit,\nproceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit,\nproceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the\nCorporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article VIII. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of\nIndemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall\nhave reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee\nunder this Article VIII for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written\nconsent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or\nlimitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee\u2019s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay\nits consent to any proposed settlement.\n \n \ne)\nAdvance of Expenses. In the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives\nnotice under this Article VIII, any expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit,\nproceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter\u037e\nprovided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such\nmatter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it\nshall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be\nindemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial\nability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. Any advances or undertakings to repay pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be unsecured\nand interest-free.\n \n \nf)\nProcedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (e) of\nthis Article VIII, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses\nshall be made as soon as practicable after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented to the Corporation, and in any event within (i)\nin the case of indemnification under paragraph (c) (Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party) or paragraph (e) (Advancement of\nExpenses), 20 business days after receipt by the Corporation, of the written request of Indemnitee, or (ii) in the case of all other\nindemnification, 45 business days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests\nunder this clause (ii), the Corporation (y) has assumed the defense pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Article VIII (and none of the\ncircumstances described in paragraph (d) of this Article VIII that would nonetheless entitle Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and\nexpenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (z) determine, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 45 business day period\nreferred to above that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct. Such determination, and any determination that\nadvanced expenses must be repaid to the Corporation, shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the\nCorporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (\u201cdisinterested directors\u201d),\nwhether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not\na quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the\nextent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.\n \n \ng)\nRemedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VIII shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such\naction that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual\ndetermination by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Article VIII\n \nA-73\nTable of Contents\n \nthat Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee\nhas not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the\nCorporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not\nentitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.\nIndemnitee\u2019s expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) reasonably incurred in connection with any action instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or\ninterpret its right to indemnification, in whole or in part, shall also be indemnified by the Corporation, regardless of whether Indemnitee is\nultimately successful in such action, unless as a part of such action a court having jurisdiction over such action makes a final judicial\ndetermination (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed) that each of the material assertions made by\nIndemnitee as a basis for such action was not made in good faith or was frivolous\u037e provided, however, that until such final judicial\ndetermination is made, Indemnitee shall be entitled under paragraph (e) of this Article VIII to advancement of expenses with respect to such\naction.\n \n \nh)\nLimitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII, except as set forth in paragraph (g) of this Article VIII, the\nCorporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by\nsuch Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Article VIII, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the\nproceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is\nsubsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the\nCorporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.\n \n \ni)\nSubsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article VIII or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other\napplicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof\nwith respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to\nthe final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.\n \n \nj)\nOther Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other\nrights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory),\nagreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee\u2019s official capacity and as to action\nin any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or\nofficer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article VIII\nshall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing\nindemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article VIII. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent\nauthorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other\npersons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VIII.\n \n \nk)\nPartial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article VIII to indemnification by the Corporation for some or\na portion of the expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties or amounts paid in\nsettlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation\nand any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the\nportion of such expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties or amounts paid in\nsettlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.\n \nA-74\nTable of Contents\n \nl)\nInsurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or\nagent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan)\nagainst any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the\nCorporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.\n \n \nm)\nSavings Clause. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the\nCorporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), liabilities, losses, judgments,\nfines, ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether\ncivil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable\nportion of this Article VIII that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n \n \nn)\nDefinitions. Terms used in this Article VIII and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings\nassigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).\n \n \no)\nSubsequent Legislation. If the DGCL is amended after adoption of this Article VIII to expand further the indemnification permitted to\nIndemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.\n \nA-75\nTable of Contents\nAnnex B",

The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the\neffective time of the Merger, will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.001\nper share, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than shares\n(a) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, (b) owned by the Company as treasury stock, and (c) held by stockholders\nwho shall not have voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement (as may be amended) and who shall have properly exercised appraisal rights\nin respect of such shares, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $21.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement provided by you as of November 21, 2021 (the\n\u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of\nthe Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company,\nincluding financial projections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past and current\noperations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company.

In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed\nMerger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits\nexpected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without\nindependent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the\nCompany and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a\nportion of which has been earned, and a further portion of which will become payable upon rendering of this opinion.
