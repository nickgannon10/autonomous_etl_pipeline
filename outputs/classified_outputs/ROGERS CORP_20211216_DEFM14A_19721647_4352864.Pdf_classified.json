Parent expects to fund\nthis amount through debt financing and net cash of the Company. Parent plans on using a portion of the proceeds\nfrom the planned divestiture of a substantial portion of the Mobility & Materials segment to repay all acquisition\nfinancing related to Rogers. The consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. See \u201cThe\nMerger-Financing of the Merger\u201d for additional information.\nInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 42)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the\nCompany\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,\nthe interests of our shareholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board was aware of these interests\nand considered them, among other matters, in reaching the determination that the merger and the Merger Agreement\nwere in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and in making the Board\u2019s recommendation regarding\nthe approval of the Merger Agreement as described in \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the\nBoard of Directors\u201d beginning on page 31. These interests include, among others:\n\u2022\naccelerated settlement of deferred stock units held by the Company\u2019s directors and cancellation and\nconversion of each such deferred stock unit award into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the\nMerger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company capital stock underlying such\ndeferred stock unit award, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of Company restricted stock unit awards held by the Company\u2019s executive officers that\nwere granted before November 1, 2021, and cancellation and conversion of each such restricted stock unit\naward into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the total\nnumber of shares of Company capital stock underlying such restricted stock unit award then deemed\nvested, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential grant of restricted stock unit awards by the Company to executive officers on terms that\npermit one-third vesting of such restricted stock unit awards granted on or after November 1, 2021 upon\ncertain qualifying terminations that occur at or after the Effective Time and within one year of the grant date\nof such restricted stock unit awards, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\naccelerated vesting of Company performance-based share unit awards outstanding immediately before the\nEffective Time held by the Company\u2019s executive officers, and cancellation and conversion of each such\nperformance-based share unit award into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Merger\nConsideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company capital stock that vest under such\nperformance-based share unit award based on 120% of the target level of performance achievement, on the\nterms set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nin the event of certain terminations of employment, cash payments payable, continued health and dental\ncoverage benefits provided and outplacement benefits provided, to executive officers of the Company\npursuant to certain severance agreements between the Company and our executive officers\u037e\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\ntax reimbursements for the Company\u2019s executive officers for the excise tax imposed on payments and\nbenefits made in connection with the merger to executive officers by reason of Section 4999 of the Code\u037e\nand\n\u2022\ncontinued indemnification and liability insurance for directors and officers following completion of the\nmerger.\nSee \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42 for additional information.\nApproval of \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d Compensation (Page 48)\nIn accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule\n14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory\nvote with respect to certain payments that may be made to our named executive officers in connection with the\nmerger, or \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation, as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 48.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\nApproval of the proposal regarding \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation requires the affirmative vote of a greater\nnumber of the votes cast in favor of this proposal than votes cast against this proposal. Approval of this proposal is\nnot a condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation is an\nadvisory vote and will not be binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether shareholders approve the \u201cgolden\nparachute\u201d compensation, if the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and the merger is completed, the\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation will still be paid to our named executive officers to the extent payable in\naccordance with the terms of such compensation.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 50)\nThe exchange of shares of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction to U.S. holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a non-\nU.S. holder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the merger) that exchanges shares of Company\ncapital stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined before deduction of any\napplicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares.\nThis exchange may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income or other tax laws.\nYou should read \u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 50 for the\ndefinition of \u201cU.S. holder\u201d and \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d and a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the merger. You should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the\nmerger on your U.S. federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.\nRegulatory Approvals (Page 52)\nThe merger is subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act of 1976, as amended. In addition to the foregoing, Parent, the Company and/or Merger Sub are\nrequired under the Merger Agreement to make certain other antitrust and foreign direct investment related filings with\ngovernmental authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions in connection with the merger. Under the terms of the Merger\nAgreement, the merger cannot be consummated if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted,\nissued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive order, temporary restraining order, stay, decree,\njudgment or injunction (preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the effect of making the\nmerger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (Page 53)\nLawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company\u2019s officers in connection with the merger,\nwhich could prevent or delay completion of the merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, two lawsuits have\nbeen filed by purported shareholders of the Company in connection with the merger. The complaints generally allege\nthat the defendants violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nby, among other things, including allegedly materially misleading or incomplete disclosure with respect to certain\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfinancial projections and analyses in the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on December 1, 2021. The\nplaintiffs in the lawsuits seek, among other things, injunctive relief, money damages and the costs of the lawsuits,\nincluding reasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. The Company and the members of the Board disagree with and\nintend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits. If the complaints are not resolved on a timely basis, they could\ndelay consummation of the merger and result in additional costs to the Company, including costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors. Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company\u2019s\nofficers in connection with the merger, which could prevent or delay completion of the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement (Page 54)\nMerger Consideration (Page 58)\nAt the Effective Time (as defined below), each share of Company capital stock issued and outstanding immediately\nprior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, will automatically be converted into the right to receive\n$277.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required tax withholding.\nTreatment of Equity Awards (Page 59)\nAt the Effective Time of the merger, each Company deferred stock unit or time vesting restricted stock unit granted\nunder the Company\u2019s 2019 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (each, an \u201cRSU\u201d), excluding Post-Signing Company\nRSUs as defined below, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cCompany RSU\u201d) will\nbecome fully vested and will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash\nequal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company capital stock subject to such\nCompany RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable required withholdings.

Provided, however, that before taking any action set out in the immediately\npreceding sentence, the Company must give Parent written notice of such action (and the basis therefor) four\nbusiness days in advance, the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to\nnegotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior\nProposal and, at the end of four business days from the date of notice to Parent, the Board must determine, after\nconsultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the\nMerger Agreement\n7\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproposed in writing by Parent, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.\nSimultaneously with a termination by Parent as a result of a Change of Recommendation or by the Company in order\nto enter into a definitive written agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Company will be obligated to\npay the Company Termination Fee, as defined below.\nFurthermore, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation\nif an Intervening Event, as defined below, has occurred and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation\nwith its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response\nto such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable law. However, prior to recommending such Acquisition Proposal, the Board must provide written notice of\nsuch action and the basis therefor four business days in advance (such notice to include a reasonably detailed\ndescription of the Intervening Event), the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent\nwishes to negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement, and the Board must determine in good faith after consultation\nwith its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that, taking into account any changes to the terms of the\nMerger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, such Intervening Event remains in effect and the failure to effect a\nChange of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under applicable law.\nYou should read \u201cSummary of the Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company\nShareholders\u201d beginning on page 65 for the definition of \u201cIntervening Event.\u201d\nTermination (Page 70)\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company at any prior time\nprior to the Effective Time and may also be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time will not\nhave occurred on the date that is six months from the date of the Merger Agreement (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d). However,\nif certain conditions to closing relating to governmental antitrust or foreign direct investment approvals have not\nbeen satisfied or waived as of the Outside Date, but all other conditions have been satisfied, then the Outside Date\nwill be extended for an additional three months after the initial Outside Date. Additionally, if such conditions to\nclosing related to such approvals have not been satisfied as of such extended Outside Date, then the Outside Date\nwill be further extended for an additional three months after the first extended Outside Date (for a final Outside Date\nthat is a year from signing). The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if a\ngovernmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted any law or order that permanently prohibits the\nconsummation of the merger, and such law or order has become final and non-appealable. The Merger Agreement\nmay also be terminated by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Company Vote will not have been obtained at\nthe Company Shareholders Meeting or the final adjournment or postponement thereof.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated by Parent, prior to the obtainment of the Requisite Company Vote, if the\nBoard will have made a Change of Recommendation or if the Company or its representatives have materially breached\ntheir no-solicitation and other obligations under Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement and by Parent, prior to the\nEffective Time, if the Company has breached any of its representations, warranties, or covenants such that relevant\nconditions to closing are not satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date (or if curable prior to\nthe Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of 30 days after notice by Parent to the Company or three\nbusiness days before the Outside Date). The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by Parent, prior to the\nEffective Time, if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the U.S. or certain foreign jurisdictions will have\nentered an order in connection with a requisite governmental approval that has become final and non-appealable,\nremains in effect, and requires Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries) to take\nactions that would have a Burdensome Effect.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated by the Company, prior to the Effective Time, if Parent has breached any of\nits representations, warranties, or covenants such that relevant conditions to closing are not satisfied and such\nbreach is not curable prior to the Outside Date (or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the\nearlier of 30 days after notice by the Company to Parent or three business days before the Outside Date). The Merger\nAgreement may also be terminated by the Company, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in order\nto enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal. Such Superior Proposal termination\nwould trigger the immediate payment of the Company Termination Fee, as defined below.\n8\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTermination Fees (Page 71)\nThe Merger Agreement provides for, in certain circumstances, a termination fee payable by the Company to Parent in\nan amount of $135 million (the \u201cCompany Termination Fee\u201d).

For the reasons\ndescribed under \u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d the Company has concluded that Company shareholders may be entitled to\nappraisal rights. The Company and Parent reserve the right to contest the validity and availability of any purported\ndemand for appraisal rights in connection with the merger.\nUnder Part 13 of the MBCA, Company shareholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in\nconnection with the merger must, in order to exercise those rights:\n\u2022\nprior to the special meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for such\nshareholders\u2019 shares of Company capital stock if the merger is effectuated\u037e\n\u2022\nNOT vote for the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\ncomply with other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.\nYOUR FAILURE TO FOLLOW EXACTLY THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED UNDER THE MBCA WILL RESULT IN\nTHE LOSS OF ANY APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK\nTHROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL\nRIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY YOUR\nBANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE.

Instead, we would remain an independent public company, our capital stock would continue\nto be listed and traded on the NYSE and our shareholders would continue to be subject to the same risks and\nopportunities to which they currently are subject with respect to their ownership of Company capital stock. If the\nmerger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future\nvalue of our shares, including the risk that the market price of Company capital stock may decline to the extent that\nthe current market price of our stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger is\nnot completed, our business could be disrupted, including our ability to retain and hire key personnel, potential\nadverse reactions or changes to our business relationships and uncertainty surrounding our future plans and\nprospects.\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the\nmerger, the Merger Agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions\nthat may be important to you as a Company shareholder. Please refer to the \u201cSummary\u201d and the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents\nreferred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the\ninformation incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d beginning on page 80.\nQ.\nWhat is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?\nA.\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the\nproposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by our shareholders and the other closing conditions\nunder the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the\nCompany being the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the merger, the Company will become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Parent and will no longer be a publicly held corporation, and you will no longer have any interest\nin our future earnings or growth. In addition, the Company capital stock will be delisted from the New York Stock\nExchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on\naccount of Company capital stock.\nQ.\nWhat will I receive if the merger is consummated?\nA.\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration of $277.00 in\ncash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, for each share of Company\ncapital stock that you own, unless you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal under Part 13 of the\nMBCA. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of Company capital stock, you will receive $277,000 in cash in\nexchange for your shares of Company capital stock, without interest and subject to deduction for any required\nwithholding tax. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the Surviving Corporation.\nQ.\nHow does the per share Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company capital stock prior to\nannouncement of the merger?\nA.\nThe Merger Consideration of $277.00 per share of Company capital stock represents an approximately 33%\npremium to the closing price per share of the Company\u2019s capital stock on November 1, 2021, the last full trading\nday prior to the announcement of the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement, when the closing price per\nshare was $208.23. The Merger Consideration also represents a 46% premium to the Volume-Weighted Average\nPrice of the Company\u2019s capital stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange for the thirty days preceding\nNovember 1, 2021.\nQ.\nWhat will holders of Company stock awards receive if the merger is consummated?\nA.\nEffective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger, each Company restricted stock unit award\nthat is then outstanding and unvested (excluding any Post-Signing Company RSUs) will vest in full and\nautomatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the\ntotal number of shares of Company capital stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit award\nthen deemed vested multiplied by the Merger Consideration, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nEffective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger, each Company performance-based share\nunit award that is then outstanding and unvested will become fully vested and will automatically be canceled\nand converted into the right to receive from the Company an amount of cash equal to the product of the total\nnumber of shares of Company capital stock that vest under such performance-based share unit award based on\n120% of the target level of performance achievement, multiplied by the Merger Consideration, on the terms set\nforth in the Merger Agreement.\nEach Post-Signing Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding\nany such Company RSU granted to a non-employee director, will be assumed by Parent and converted\nautomatically into a Parent RSU, except that such Parent RSU will relate to a number of shares of Parent common\nstock that is determined based on the ratio of the Merger Consideration to the average closing price per share of\nParent\u2019s capital stock for the period of ten consecutive trading days preceding the last trading day prior to the\nclosing date of the Merger.\n1\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ.\nWhat will happen to the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)?\nA.\nAny offering period that commenced prior to November 1, 2021 shall end as of a date selected by the Company\nprior to the Effective Time of the merger, and each outstanding right to purchase shares of capital stock of the\nCompany granted under such plan will be automatically exercised as of that date. Until the merger is effective or\nthe Merger Agreement is terminated, no new offering period may commence under the ESPP.\nQ.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the proposal to approve the Merger\nAgreement, \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation\nand \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary\nor appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to\napprove the Merger Agreement.\nQ.\nWhy is the Board recommending that I vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the proposal to approve the Merger\nAgreement?\nA.\nAfter careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for the\nMerger\u037e Recommendation of the Board of Directors,\u201d the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors:\n\u2022\ndetermined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it\nadvisable, for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nadopted the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\napproved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company and the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nresolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nQ.\nWhen do you expect the merger to be consummated?\nA.\nWe are working towards completing the merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary\nclosing conditions, including the approval by our shareholders of the proposal to approve the Merger\nAgreement, we currently anticipate that the merger will be consummated in the second quarter of 2022.\nQ.\nWhat happens if the merger is not consummated?\nA.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by the shareholders of the Company or if the merger is not\nconsummated for any other reason, the shareholders of the Company would not receive any payment for their\nshares of Company capital stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company would remain an\nindependent public company, and the Company capital stock would continue to be listed and traded on the New\nYork Stock Exchange. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Parent a fee with\nrespect to the termination of the Merger Agreement or Parent may be required to pay to the Company a fee with\nrespect to the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled \u201cSummary of the\nMerger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d beginning on page 71.\nQ.\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\nA.\nYes. The exchange of shares of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction to U.S. holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a\nnon-U.S. holder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the merger) that exchanges shares of\nCompany capital stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined before\ndeduction of any applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in such shares. This may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income\nor other tax laws. You should read \u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 50 for the definition of \u201cU.S. holder\u201d and \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d and a more detailed discussion of\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, you\nshould also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your U.S. federal,\nstate and local and/or foreign taxes.\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in\naddition to my interests as a shareholder?\nA.\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to approve the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may\nbe different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The Board was aware of and\nconsidered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the\nmerger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the shareholders of the Company. See\n\u201cThe Merger-Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 42.\nQ.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?\nA.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form in connection with the\nsolicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting because you owned shares of Company capital\nstock as of the Record Date for the special meeting. This proxy statement describes matters on which we urge\nyou to vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares of Company capital stock with\nrespect to such matters.\nQ.\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA.\nThe special meeting of shareholders of the Company will be held on January 25, 2022 at 8:30 AM, local time, at\n2225 W.

If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote a ballot at the special meeting, or if\nyou do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares of\nCompany capital stock will not be voted on these proposals, and thus will have no effect on these proposals.\nQ.\nWhy am I being asked to cast a nonbinding advisory vote to approve \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation that the\nCompany\u2019s named executive officers will receive in connection with the merger?\nA.\nThe SEC\u2019s rules require us to seek a nonbinding advisory vote with respect to certain payments that will be\nmade to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\nQ.\nWhat will happen if shareholders do not approve the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation at the special meeting?\nA.\nApproval of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation that our named executive officers may receive in connection with\nthe merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to \u201cgolden parachute\u201d\ncompensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether shareholders\napprove the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation, if the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and\nthe merger is completed, the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation may still be paid to our named executive officers\nto the extent payable in accordance with the terms of such compensation arrangements.\nQ.\nWho can vote at the special meeting?\nA.\nAll of our holders of Company capital stock of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2021, the\nRecord Date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nRogers\u2019 Board of Directors, with the assistance of Rogers\u2019 management, regularly evaluates Rogers\u2019 short-, medium-\nand long-term prospects and its multi-year business strategy in light of its performance, the general business and\neconomic environment, conditions in the advanced materials industry and the industries into which the Company\u2019s\nproducts are sold, and strategic and tactical opportunities available to and challenges facing Rogers, all with a view\ntoward enhancing long-term shareholder value. The Board\u2019s evaluation of Rogers\u2019 prospects and strategy involves\nregular ongoing evaluations, including annual strategy reviews, and is informed by discussions with management,\nindustry consultants, advisors and investment banks regarding industry trends, financing considerations, global\npolicy matters and other factors pertaining to Rogers\u2019 prospects and strategy.\nIn pursuit of its long-term strategic plan, over the last five years Rogers has invested in manufacturing capacity\nexpansion, additional technical and commercial resources, and operational improvements to support organic growth\nopportunities and consummated several synergistic acquisitions for inorganic growth.\nRogers\u2019 growth strategy has focused on developing and marketing specialized engineered materials for advanced\nmobility and advanced connectivity applications, particularly in the automotive, portable electronics and\ntelecommunications industries, as well as other markets including general industrial, aerospace and defense, mass\ntransit and clean energy. Most recently, accelerating demand for electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV) and\nadvanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the global automotive industry has presented Rogers with an\ninflecting growth opportunity that requires significant manufacturing capacity expansion, capabilities additions and\npersonnel hiring in the United States, China, and Europe, as well as potentially new markets, all of which require\nsignificantly higher than historical capital expenditures and operating expense commitments.\nOn October 1, 2019, Rajiv Gupta, then a member of the board of directors of DuPont and acquaintance of Bruce\nHoechner, President and CEO of Rogers, contacted Mr. Hoechner to request a meeting between Mr. Hoechner and\nEdward Breen, then serving as Executive Chairman of DuPont, to discuss the potential for a business combination\nbetween the Company and DuPont.\nOn October 2, 2019, Mr. Breen spoke with Mr. Hoechner and expressed interest in acquiring the Company.\nOn October 10, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board met at the Company\u2019s headquarters in Chandler, Arizona and considered\nthe communication from DuPont and potential responses. During that meeting, a representative of Covington &\nBurling LLP (\u201cCovington\u201d), legal counsel to the Company, briefed the Board on its fiduciary duties, including in the\ncontext of an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The Board discussed the Company\u2019s strategic plan, growth trajectory\nand market opportunities. The Board concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company to remain\nindependent and continue executing on its strategic growth plan, and, therefore, a meeting with Mr. Breen would not\nbe appropriate at that time. On October 11, 2019, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and communicated the Board\u2019s\nposition regarding Mr. Breen\u2019s meeting invitation. Mr. Breen agreed that, under the circumstances of the Board\u2019s\nposition, a meeting would not be useful at that time.\nOn August 25, 2021, Mr. Gupta, although no longer a member of DuPont\u2019s board of directors, contacted Mr.\nHoechner again to request a dinner meeting with Mr. Breen (now DuPont\u2019s Executive Chairman and CEO). On\n24TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAugust 26, 2021 Mr. Hoechner conferred with Peter Wallace, Chairman of the Board of the Company, to discuss Mr.\nGupta\u2019s invitation. They concluded that Mr. Hoechner should accept the meeting to listen to what Mr. Breen might\npropose and assess his intentions. Mr. Wallace separately communicated with the other Board members regarding\nthe advisability and objectives of the proposed meeting.\nOn August 27, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Gupta to accept the meeting with Mr. Breen and to discuss\narrangements for scheduling a meeting on September 15, 2021.\nOn September 15, 2021, Mr. Hoechner met with Mr. Breen and Mr. Gupta for dinner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Mr.\nBreen expressed interest in a negotiated acquisition of the Company by DuPont. Mr. Breen discussed DuPont\u2019s\nincreased focus on market opportunities relating to advanced connectivity and advanced mobility and DuPont\u2019s\ndesire to enhance its position in these markets through potential acquisitions. Mr. Breen further discussed his views\nregarding the potential benefits of a transaction between the Company and DuPont, including the alignment of the\nCompany\u2019s business with DuPont\u2019s goals and interest in expanding in the advanced materials sector. Mr. Hoechner\nadvised Mr. Breen that he would discuss these matters with the Company\u2019s Board.\nOn September 16, 2021, Mr. Hoechner conferred with Mr. Wallace and Board members Keith Barnes and Ganesh\nMoorthy to discuss Mr. Hoechner\u2019s meeting with Mr. Breen. Mr. Wallace also conferred with Board members Helene\nSimonet and Keith Larson. The Board members expressed confidence in the Company\u2019s strategic plan and\nencouraged Mr. Hoechner to inform Mr. Breen that the Company was focused on continuing to execute such plan,\nbut may be interested in a transaction with DuPont that contemplated the purchase of all outstanding Company\ncapital stock at a price in excess of $300 per share. On September 16, 2021, the closing price per share of the\nCompany\u2019s capital stock on the NYSE was $190.16.\nOn September 17, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and communicated that the Company was focused on\nexecuting its strategic growth plan, but based on discussions with some members of the Board, Mr. Hoechner\nbelieved the Company may be interested in a transaction with DuPont that contemplated the purchase of all\noutstanding Company capital stock at a price in excess of $300 per share.\nOn September 20, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and conveyed that DuPont would not be able to meet a\n$300 per share acquisition price, but that for the reasons discussed during the dinner in New Hope, DuPont remained\nvery interested in acquiring the Company and did not intend to abandon its pursuit of the Company as it had in 2019.\nAccordingly, Mr. Breen indicated that he would be willing to send a letter to the Company\u2019s Board to outline\nDuPont's interest in, and commitment to pursuing, a transaction in a timely and efficient fashion if the Company's\nBoard would find it helpful to have DuPont's proposal in writing.\nOn September 21, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to invite continued discussion of an acquisition proposal\nand offered to arrange a meeting between the parties to provide DuPont with an opportunity to better understand the\nCompany's value and growth trajectory. On September 22, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and provided a\nlist of preliminary due diligence topics for discussion in connection with a potential acquisition proposal.\nOn September 23, 2021, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference. At the meeting, Mr. Wallace and Mr.\nHoechner reported to the full Board on the communications to date between Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen. Jay Knoll,\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Development, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and a representative of\nCovington briefed the Board on its fiduciary duties, including in the context of an unsolicited acquisition offer. Mr.\nKnoll and the representative of Covington also discussed related matters, such as the potential retention of a\nfinancial advisor and the use of non-disclosure agreements with standstill provisions. The Board discussed the\nretention of a financial advisor and recommended that the Company engage J.P. Morgan in this capacity as events\nwarranted, based on J.P. Morgan\u2019s long-standing commercial banking relationship with the Company, regular\ninvestment banking discussions involving the Company\u2019s management and J.P. Morgan, relevant investment banking\nexperience involving J.P. Morgan and certain members of the Company\u2019s Board, and J.P. Morgan\u2019s industry\nexperience and overall strength as a financial advisor.\nOn September 24, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and stated that DuPont\u2019s proposal to undertake\npreliminary due diligence was premature and the Company would only consider providing DuPont access to due\ndiligence information in connection with a compelling acquisition proposal.\nOn September 27, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by\nDuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $240 per share.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Company requested that J.P. Morgan prepare a preliminary financial analysis to be reviewed with the Board,\nincluding an assessment of DuPont\u2019s proposal and transaction history.\nOn September 29, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and conveyed that the Board was evaluating DuPont\u2019s\nproposal and would respond after reviewing the Company\u2019s strategic plan at the Board\u2019s regularly scheduled meeting\non October 6, 2021 and after further discussions with the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors.\nOn September 30, 2021, Mr. Breen sent a confirmatory letter to Mr. Hoechner outlining his proposal for acquiring the\nCompany for $240 per share. This letter was shared with the Rogers Board and representatives from Covington and\nJ.P. Morgan.\nOn October 5, 2021, J.P. Morgan provided the Company its relationship disclosure letter.\nOn October 6, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Chandler, Arizona.\nThe Board convened initially, joined by the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Ram Mayampurath, Chief Technology\nOfficer, Bob Daigle, Mr. Knoll and a representative of Covington. The Board discussed the proposal from DuPont and\nMr. Hoechner\u2019s communications with Mr. Breen to date. Mr. Hoechner reviewed his recent exchanges with Mr. Breen\nand summarized the current status of their discussions, including the request from DuPont for preliminary due\ndiligence. Mr. Knoll and a representative of Covington reviewed the Board\u2019s duties of care and loyalty. The Board\nconsidered J.P. Morgan\u2019s relationship disclosure letter and discussed whether acquaintance relationships between\nMr. Breen and Company directors Mr. Wallace and Jeff Owens and ownership by various directors of modest\namounts of DuPont stock presented a conflict of interest for consideration of a potential transaction between the\nCompany and DuPont. Following discussion, the Board determined that these matters did not present conflicts of\ninterest that would impair independent or impartial judgments regarding a potential transaction with DuPont.\nThe Board then invited other members of management, together with management\u2019s business advisors, to join the\nmeeting as part of the Company\u2019s ordinary course strategic planning process, including consideration of an updated\nfive-year strategic plan and financial forecast. Management\u2019s presentations included specific business segment and\nglobal operations strategies, highlighting growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity requirements, personnel and\ncapabilities requirements, and associated financial and capital needs. The Board discussed the strategic plan with\nmanagement in detail and expressed support for the plan.\nThe Board excused the business advisors and members of management, except Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath and\nKnoll. The Board then discussed the risks and opportunities reflected in the Company\u2019s strategic plan in the context\nof DuPont\u2019s proposal.\nThe Board then invited representatives of J.P. Morgan to join the meeting. The J.P. Morgan representatives discussed\nDuPont\u2019s proposal and presented a preliminary financial analysis of the Company based upon the Company\u2019s\nstrategic plan. The J.P. Morgan representatives also discussed various strategies for engaging in further discussions\nwith DuPont, and the possibility of contacting a limited number of other potential acquirers on a confidential basis at\na later point, if discussions with DuPont were to progress further. The J.P. Morgan representatives also discussed the\nimportance of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with DuPont, should the Board decide to authorize further\ndiscussions with DuPont. Throughout this discussion, the Board asked questions of J.P. Morgan, Covington and\nCompany management including regarding DuPont\u2019s track record of acquisitions, expected and potential synergies\nand their implication on potential purchase price, how DuPont regards the Company\u2019s fit with DuPont\u2019s business\nstrategy, regulatory approval risks for a transaction, and risks to the Company of pursuing or not pursuing a\ntransaction with DuPont.\nFollowing these considerations, the Board assessed that a transaction with DuPont at an appropriate value would\nenhance the Company\u2019s ability to realize the opportunities reflected in its strategic plan. The Board determined that\nfurther discussions with DuPont under a satisfactory non-disclosure and standstill agreement could be constructive\nif DuPont first presented a substantially higher offer. The Board determined that the $240 per share proposal from\nDuPont was inadequate, including in light of the expected value of the Company to be realized upon the execution of\nthe Company\u2019s strategic plan. The Board authorized Mr. Hoechner to contact Mr. Breen on October 8 following the\nCompany\u2019s expected public announcement of a pending acquisition for the purpose of inviting Mr. Breen to improve\nDuPont\u2019s offer.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo facilitate the Board\u2019s oversight of any further engagement with DuPont, the Board adopted resolutions creating an\nExecutive Committee of the Board to which Helene Simonet, Mr. Barnes, Mr. Hoechner, Mr. Moorthy and Mr. Wallace\nwere appointed, with Mr. Wallace serving as its chair.\nOn October 8, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing its acquisition of Silicon Engineering Ltd., a\nEuropean manufacturer of silicone material solutions. After the press release was issued, Mr. Breen contacted Mr.\nHoechner to congratulate the Company on the acquisition. Mr. Hoechner advised Mr. Breen that the Board had\nconsidered DuPont\u2019s proposal for an acquisition of the Company at $240 per share. Mr. Hoechner further explained\nthat although the Board recognized the possible advantages stemming from a potential combination between the\nCompany and DuPont, the Board unanimously rejected DuPont\u2019s proposal, which the Board did not view as being\nacceptable or adequate as a basis for the Company and DuPont to engage in further discussions. Mr. Hoechner\ncommunicated to Mr. Breen the Board\u2019s confidence in the Company\u2019s strategic plan. Mr. Breen acknowledged the\nCompany\u2019s position and advised that DuPont would reflect on the matter and respond promptly.\nLater on October 8, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by\nDuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $250 per share. Mr. Hoechner indicated that he\nexpected the Board would require a substantially higher price, but stated that he would take the revised offer to the\nBoard for its consideration.\nOn October 9, 2021, the Executive Committee of the Board held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the most\nrecent proposal from DuPont. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting\nalong with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. The\nExecutive Committee discussed the proposal with members of senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nExecutive Committee discussed the proposal with members of senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nrepresentatives of Covington. After careful consideration, the Board determined that the proposal from DuPont was\ninadequate.\nLater on October 9, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to convey that the Board viewed the most recent\nproposal from DuPont as not being adequate and invited Mr. Breen to offer a higher price. Later that day, Mr. Breen\ncontacted Mr. Hoechner and advised that DuPont could not increase its offer without access to certain due diligence\ninformation.\nOn October 10, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference and Mr. Hoechner briefed the\nCommittee regarding his recent conversations with Mr. Breen. All other members of the Board also participated in the\nExecutive Committee meeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan and Covington. Mr. Hoechner informed the Board that while he thought it would be possible for DuPont to\nimprove its $250 per share offer, he believed, based on the position Mr. Breen had conveyed in their most recent\ndiscussion, that DuPont would be unlikely to do so without access to confidential information. Following\ndiscussions, the Executive Committee resolved to authorize Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Knoll to negotiate and enter into a\nnon-disclosure and standstill agreement with DuPont and thereafter to provide such limited non-public information\nas necessary to facilitate a revised proposal from DuPont. The Executive Committee also formally approved the\nengagement of J.P. Morgan as financial advisor.\nLater on October 10, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and both parties agreed that, subject to prior execution\nof a mutually satisfactory non-disclosure and standstill agreement, representatives from DuPont would have further\nmeetings with members of the Company\u2019s senior management in Arizona. Mr. Knoll sent a draft non-disclosure and\nstandstill agreement to DuPont\u2019s General Counsel, Erik Hoover.\nOn October 11, 2021, Mr. Breen and Mr. Hoechner held discussions regarding the terms and duration of the\nCompany\u2019s proposed non-disclosure and standstill agreement. Mr. Breen indicated that DuPont would not be willing\nto agree to a standstill without a better understanding of the per share price range in which the Company Board\nwould be willing to permit substantive engagement with DuPont in connection with a potential acquisition. Later that\nsame day, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen discussed the valuation of the Company further. During the course of the\ndiscussion, Mr. Breen enquired whether the Board was seeking a significantly higher valuation and whether that\ncould be as high as $270 per share. Mr. Hoechner indicated that while he was not authorized to provide a specific\nrange at which the Board would consider engaging in further discussions, Mr. Hoechner believed, that, based on\nprior discussions with the Board, the Board would require a price of more than $270 per share in order to proceed with\ndiscussions regarding a possible transaction. Mr. Hoechner urged Mr. Breen to use the opportunity to evaluate the\nCompany\u2019s strategic plan under the terms of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement and was convinced that Mr.\nBreen would then see the rationale in the Board\u2019s expectations for a higher valuation for the Company. Mr. Breen\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreed to executing a non-disclosure and standstill agreement to evaluate the strategic plan and reassess his\nproposal. Mr. Breen requested that DuPont be allowed to share any financials and strategic plans offered by the\nCompany with certain potential financing sources. Mr. Hoechner advised that he would consider the request and\ndiscuss it with the Board and the Company\u2019s advisors.\nOn October 12, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference and Mr. Hoechner provided an\nupdate on his conversations with Mr. Breen and the ongoing negotiations regarding a non-disclosure and standstill\nagreement. All other members of the Board, except for Mr. Owens, also participated in the Executive Committee\nmeeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. Mr.\nKnoll explained the status of negotiations, and the Executive Committee determined that a one-year standstill would\nbe acceptable, but that it was premature to permit DuPont to share confidential information with financing sources.\nMr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to communicate the Executive Committee\u2019s decision and later that evening,\ncounsel for DuPont and the Company concluded negotiations of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement that the\nparties executed on the morning of October 13, 2021.\nOn October 13, 2021, members of the Company\u2019s senior management held meetings with representatives of DuPont in\nTempe, Arizona to present elements of the Company\u2019s financial forecast, operating plan and strategic plan, and to\nrespond to due diligence questions.\nOn October 15, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by\nDuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $260 per share, subject to an appropriate due diligence\nreview by DuPont. Mr. Breen advised Mr. Hoechner that there was sound justification for the increased offer based\nupon the information conveyed at the October 13, 2021, meeting, in particular the Company\u2019s customer design wins\nand forecasts in the areas of EV/HEV and ADAS.\nLater on October 15, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the most recent\nproposal from DuPont. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting along\nwith Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. Representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan provided a preliminary financial analysis of the proposal and potential price that DuPont could offer\nconsistent with its published acquisition criteria. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed potential negotiation\nstrategies, intended to assess whether DuPont would be willing to offer a price that the Board could determine to be\nacceptable. In light of confidentiality concerns, the Board concluded that it would be premature to contact other\npotential acquirers prior to DuPont offering a price that the Board would approve. After considering the most recent\nproposal from DuPont, the Board rejected DuPont\u2019s $260 per share proposal as inadequate. The Board authorized Mr.\nHoechner to contact Mr. Breen to propose an acquisition price of $285 per share, subject to the negotiation of an\nappropriate definitive transaction agreement.\nOn October 16, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and informed him of the Board\u2019s rejection of an offer at $260\nper share and the Board\u2019s intention to terminate further discussions if DuPont declined to offer a substantially higher\nprice.\nOn October 17, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner to discuss the valuation of the Company and to deliver a\nproposal contemplating the purchase by DuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $270 per\nshare. After conferring with Mr. Wallace, Mr. Hoechner later contacted Mr. Breen and advised that the Board would\nsupport a transaction at an acquisition price of $285 per share, subject to an acceptable definitive transaction\nagreement.\nOn October 18, 2021, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen held a telephonic meeting where Mr. Hoechner informed Mr. Breen\nthat the Board would not agree to the $270 per share offer. During the discussion, Mr. Breen inquired whether an offer\nof $277 per share would be considered by the Board. At this point, Mr. Hoechner said he would discuss that per\nshare price with Mr. Wallace.\nLater on October 18, 2021, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Wallace held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Breen. During the\nmeeting, Mr. Breen reiterated DuPont\u2019s strong interest in a transaction. Mr. Breen further communicated DuPont\u2019s\nintention, should a transaction be agreed to and completed, to integrate the Company\u2019s business, including certain\noperations facilities and functions, as a key component of DuPont\u2019s Electronics & Industrial business segment, with\nsynergies generally focused on public company costs and administrative functions. Mr. Breen further explained that,\nalthough he did not yet have authority from the DuPont board for an offer of more than $275 per share, if the\nCompany\u2019s Board, pursuant to a recommendation by Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Wallace, would be willing to accept\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$277 per share, Mr. Breen would seek approval from the DuPont board for that price. Messrs. Hoechner and Wallace\nadvised Mr. Breen that they would recommend DuPont\u2019s conditional proposal of $277 per share to the Company\u2019s\nBoard, subject to an appropriate definitive transaction agreement.\nOn October 19, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference, where Mr. Hoechner discussed Mr.\nBreen\u2019s conditional offer of $277 per share. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive\nCommittee meeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nCovington. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed the offer in the context of J.P. Morgan\u2019s preliminary financial\nanalysis of the Company and compared the offer to similar, consummated transactions. The Executive Committee\nasked questions of the J.P. Morgan representatives who further discussed the proposal from DuPont. The Executive\nCommittee discussed the impact of accepting the offer on the Company\u2019s various constituencies, including DuPont\u2019s\nfuture plans for the Company and its business divisions. The Executive Committee, in consultation with\nrepresentatives from J.P. Morgan and Covington, also discussed the possibility of conducting a market check and the\nrisks to the Company of sharing confidential information with other potential acquirers. The Executive Committee\nconsidered DuPont\u2019s proposal\u037e the opportunities and risks inherent in the Company\u2019s strategic plan, with the\nresulting valuation\u037e the commitment, capabilities and resources of DuPont to grow the Company\u2019s business and\nmitigate those risks\u037e and the fact that DuPont was not a direct competitor of the Company. The Executive Committee\nconcluded that the updated conditional proposal from DuPont, if confirmed by DuPont, should be accepted and\nresolved to approve the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement at a price of $277 per share. The Executive\nCommittee further concluded, after considering the likelihood of potential competing bidders and the risk of leaks and\ndelays, not to contact third parties to solicit alternative proposals at that time. In addition, at DuPont\u2019s request, the\nBoard approved Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., or an affiliate, as an approved DuPont financing source with which\nDuPont could share confidential information about the Company under the non-disclosure and standstill agreement.\nRepresentatives of Covington then presented to the Executive Committee an overview of the key terms to be\nnegotiated in a merger agreement as well as an illustrative timeline for a transaction. The Executive Committee asked\nquestions of Covington, discussed various aspects of the merger agreement, and then directed the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement to proceed with the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement providing for the purchase by DuPont\nof all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $277 per share.\nLater on October 19, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to inform Mr. Breen that the Board had approved\nengaging with DuPont at a price of $277 per share, subject to approval of such proposal by the DuPont board and\nnegotiation of an acceptable definitive merger agreement. Later on October 19, 2021 Mr. Breen contacted Mr.\nHoechner to inform him that DuPont was willing to proceed with negotiation of a merger agreement at a price of $277\nper share. Messrs. Hoechner and Breen also discussed the organization of due diligence efforts as well as\ncoordination amongst the parties\u2019 legal advisors. Mr. Breen informed Mr. Hoechner that Skadden, Arps, Slate,\nMeagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), legal counsel to DuPont in connection with the acquisition, would furnish\nCovington with a draft merger agreement.\nOn October 21, 2021, representatives of Covington received a draft merger agreement from Skadden. The provisions\nof the draft merger agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants for transactions of this\nnature, provisions enabling the Board to evaluate superior proposals and change its recommendation to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders with respect to the transaction in compliance with its fiduciary duties, and a proposed\ntermination fee payable by the Company of $185 million.\nOn October 21, 2021, the Company and its representatives organized and began preparing a virtual data room for\nDuPont and its representatives to conduct due diligence.\nOn October 22, 2021, representatives of DuPont met with representatives of the Company in Tempe, Arizona to\ndiscuss additional diligence, including regarding potential synergies.\nOn October 23, 2021, members of the Company\u2019s senior management, Covington and J.P. Morgan held a meeting by\nvideoconference to discuss the draft merger agreement. Key issues centered around (i) enhancing deal certainty for\nthe Company by strengthening DuPont\u2019s obligations to obtain regulatory approval and modify the definition of\n\u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d as it pertained to closing conditions, (ii) facilitating the Company\u2019s ability to consider a\nsuperior proposal, including by lowering the termination fee, and (iii) protecting the Company\u2019s ability and flexibility\nto execute on its strategic plan and other interim operations, including employee compensation matters, pending\ncompletion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. Later that evening, Covington provided Skadden\nwith a revised draft of the merger agreement.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 24, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the draft merger\nagreement. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting along with Messrs.\nDaigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll and Benjamin Buckley, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of the\nCompany. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington also participated. Representatives of Covington reviewed\nand discussed with the Executive Committee the proposed merger structure and provisions involving deal certainty,\ndeal protection, interim operating covenants, employee compensation matters, director and officer indemnification\nand dispute resolution, among other matters. Mr. Buckley advised the Executive Committee on employee\ncompensation matters in connection with the draft merger agreement, explaining that management\u2019s goals were to\nretain key Company personnel to execute on the Company\u2019s operating and strategic plans and preserve the\nCompany\u2019s flexibility to respond appropriately to challenges that may arise in the interim period before closing of the\ntransaction. Mr. Buckley also discussed a proposed key employee retention plan (\u201cKERP\u201d) being prepared by the\nCompany\u2019s senior management together with Covington. Mr. Buckley also advised the Executive Committee\nregarding the treatment of the Company\u2019s existing benefit and severance plans outside the KERP, as well as efforts to\nassess potential issues arising from Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and the potential implications for\nexecutive retention. The Executive Committee asked questions of Mr. Buckley, members of senior Company\nmanagement and Covington, and discussed how best to effectuate the goals of employee retention. The Executive\nCommittee then directed management of the Company and Covington to negotiate for robust protections and\nflexibility for the Company during the interim period.\nOver the course of the next week, from October 25, 2021 to October 29, 2021, the Company, DuPont and their\nrespective counsel and advisors conducted several due diligence telephonic meetings to discuss topics including\nintellectual property, information technology, human resources and other operational, financial, legal, tax,\nenvironmental, health and safety matters and conducted in-person site visits at three of the Company's significant\nmanufacturing sites.

        "Section Text": "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board of Directors\nAt a meeting held on November 1, 2021, the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors, determined that it is in the\nbest interests of the Company and the Company\u2019s shareholders, and declared it advisable, for the Company to enter\ninto the Merger Agreement, adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance\nof the Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders\nof the Company.\n31TABLE OF CONTENTS\nBefore making its recommendation, the Board consulted with its outside legal and financial advisors and with the\nCompany\u2019s senior management team. In reaching its recommendation, the Board focused on a number of factors,\nincluding the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration of $277.00 per share in cash to be received by the Company\u2019s\nshareholders represented a significant premium across a number of measuring periods, including a premium\nof 33% over the $208.23 closing price of the Company\u2019s capital stock on November 1, 2021 (the last trading\nday prior to the public announcement of the merger) and a 46% premium to the one-month volume\nweighted average share price of $189.74\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the certainty provided by the acquisition of the Company by Parent for $277.00 per\nshare in cash was more favorable to Company shareholders than the potential risk-weighted value of\nremaining an independent public company, which belief was informed by its evaluation of the Company\u2019s\nshort-, medium- and long-term prospects were it to remain an independent public company and pursue its\ngrowth strategy, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such strategy, including those\ninherent in the Company\u2019s inflecting growth opportunities (including resources, capacity expansion and\nhistoric capital and operational expenditures) and the current and prospective business environment in\nwhich the Company operates, including international, national and local economic conditions and the\ncompetitive and regulatory environments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, based on the historical and projected financial information concerning the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, financial performance and condition, results of operations, earnings, competitive position and\nprospects as a stand-alone company and the Board\u2019s assessment that the merger would be favorable to the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty of value and\nimmediate liquidity to Company shareholders upon the consummation of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of the risks to the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, assets, operating results, financial condition, competitive position, and industry on the trading\nprice of the Company\u2019s capital stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe extensive negotiations between the Company and Parent over price, including the fact that the\nCompany was able to obtain as a result of such negotiations a 15.4% increase in the price per share from\nthe initial Parent proposal at $240.00 per share to the final price of $277.00 per share, and the Board\u2019s belief\nthat the $277.00 per share price represented the highest price per share that Parent was willing to pay for\nthe Company\u2019s capital stock, considering the due diligence conducted by Parent and the negotiations\nbetween the parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, based on consultation with its financial advisors, that the negotiations with Parent had\nresulted in a transaction price, taking into account the Company\u2019s forecasts, at or above the upper end of\napplicable valuation methods and that undertaking broader outreach to third parties, which could prove\nunsuccessful, would raise undue risk to the Company of potential loss of competitively sensitive\nconfidential information and key personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board\nthat, as of November 1, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions set forth in its opinion, the\nMerger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the shares of Company capital stock in the proposed\nmerger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-",

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated October 11, 2021, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in\nconnection with the proposed merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on November 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid to the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its November 1, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written\nopinion to the Board, dated November 1, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the\nholders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nshareholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated November 1, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s shareholders are\nurged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as\nsuch) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only to the\nMerger Consideration to be paid in the proposed merger and did not address any other aspect of the proposed\nmerger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any other\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the proposed merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as\nto how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the proposed merger with the publicly available financial terms of\ncertain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for\nsuch companies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the Company\u2019s capital stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the internal financial forecasts and projections prepared by the management of the Company\nrelating to its business, which are summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d\nbeginning on page 40 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the proposed merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed\nnecessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for\nindependently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was\nnot provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company, DuPont or the Merger Sub under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar\nmatters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan\nassumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the\nCompany to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts\nor the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the proposed merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement.\nJ.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, DuPont and Merger Sub in\nthe Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its\nanalysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the\nCompany with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed merger will be obtained without any\nadverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger.\nThe projections furnished to J.P. Morgan and summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d\nbeginning on page 40 of this proxy statement were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Company does not\npublicly disclose the internal management projections provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis of the proposed merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These\nprojections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the\ncontrol of the Company\u2019s management. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the\nprojections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer\nto the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed\nmerger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to\nengage in the proposed merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature\nof any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of\nsuch persons relative to the Merger Consideration in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of any such\ncompensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company\u2019s capital stock will trade at\nany future time.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and DuPont, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely\nthat of the Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the\nBoard in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board\nor the Company\u2019s management with respect to the proposed merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on November 1, 2021 and contained in the presentation delivered\nto the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to\nbe a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmore fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the\nCompany with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to\nbe analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., CMC\nMaterials, Inc., Entegris, Inc., FormFactor, Inc., Graco, Inc., Helios Technologies, Inc., Idex Corporation, II-VI, Inc.,\nIngevity Corporation, Littelfuse, Inc., Nordson Corporation, Quaker Chemical Corporation, Teledyne Technologies\nIncorporated, and Wolfspeed, Inc. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly\ntraded companies with operations and business that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses, may be considered\nsufficiently similar to those of the Company based on business sector participation, operational characteristics and\nfinancial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to the Company and certain of these\ncompanies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The\nanalyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently\nthan they would affect the Company.\nFor each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of firm value to EBITDA based on publicly\navailable financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the\n2022 calendar year (which we refer to as \u201cCY2022E FV / EBITDA\u201d). For each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan\nalso calculated the price to earnings ratio based on publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates\nper FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the 2022 calendar year (which we refer to as \u201cCY2022E P/E\u201d).\nBased on the results of these analyses and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a\nmultiple reference range of 12.0x to 20.0x for CY22E FV / EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 16.5x to 30.0x for\nCY22E P/E and applied these reference ranges to the CY2022E EBITDA and CY22E earnings per share, respectively,\nas provided by the Company\u2019s management in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value\nrange of $179.00 to $297.00 per share for the CY22E FV / EBITDA analysis and an implied equity value range of\n$142.00 to $259.00 per share for the CY22E P/E analysis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company,\ncompared, in each case, to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital\nstock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.\nSelected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions\ninvolving companies that engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to be reasonably analogous to the\nbusiness of the Company or aspects thereof. None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the\nproposed merger. Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the\nproposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily\ninvolve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of\nthe companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the\nproposed merger. For each of the selected transactions, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of the target company\u2019s firm\nvalue to the public estimates of EBITDA for the last 12-month period prior to the date of announcement (which we\nrefer to as \u201cLTM FV / EBITDA\u201d). Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:\nAnnouncement \nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\nSeptember 2021\nMaterion Corporation\nHCS-Electronic Materials\nJuly 2021\nMKS Instruments, Inc.\nAtotech Limited\nJune 2021\nElement Solutions Inc.\nCoventya Holding SAS\nMarch 2021\nDuPont de Nemours, Inc.\nLaird Performance Materials\nApril 2019\nParker Hannifin Corporation\nLORD Corporation\nApril 2019\nMerck KGaA\nVersum Materials, Inc.\nAugust 2018\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation\nKMG Chemicals, Inc.\nJuly 2018\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nBOYD Corporation\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnouncement \nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\nJune 2018\nEntegris, Inc.\nSAES Pure Gas\nMarch 2018\nAdvent International Corp.\nLaird PLC.\nOctober 2017\nBC Partners\nCeramTec GmbH\nApril 2017\nQuaker Chemical Corporation\nHoughton International Inc.\nApril 2017\nKMG Chemicals, Inc.\nFlowchem LLC\nBased on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a\nmultiple reference range of 11.0x to 19.5x for LTM FV / EBITDA, and applied this reference range to the LTM EBITDA\nfor the Company as of September 30, 2021, which includes Silicone Engineering, as provided by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value range of $139.00 to $245.00 per\nshare (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company, compared to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00\nper share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining the implied fully diluted equity value per share for the Company\u2019s capital stock. J.P. Morgan calculated\nthe unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from Q4 2021 through 2026 based upon\nfinancial projections prepared by the management of the Company, which are summarized in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Financial Projections\u201d beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of\nterminal asset values of the Company at the end of the six-year period ending in 2026 by applying a perpetual growth\nrate ranging from 4.0% to 5.0% of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during the terminal year of the six-\nyear period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then discounted to present\nvalues using a range of discount rates from 9.0% to 10.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an\nanalysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows\nand the range of terminal asset values were then adjusted for the Company\u2019s net cash of $43 million. Based on the\nresults of this analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of equity values of between $202.00 and $330.00 per share (in\neach case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company\u2019s capital stock on a stand-alone basis (i.e., without\nsynergies).\nOther Information.\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P. Morgan\nreviewed the trading range for Company capital stock for the 52-week period ended October 29, 2021. J.P. Morgan\nnoted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $116.00 and $214.00 per share of Company\ncapital stock, respectively.\nAnalyst Price Targets for the Company. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P.\nMorgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research analyst share price targets adjusted to present value\nassuming a cost of equity of 10.5% for Company capital stock, and noted that the range of such price targets,\nrounded to the nearest $1.00, was $204.00 to $253.00 per share of Company capital stock, in each case, as compared to\n(i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021\nof $201.12 per share.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the\nCompany. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the proposed merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because\nthey are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may\nbe considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their\nparticipants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed\nmerger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial\nand operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to the Company and the transactions compared to the proposed merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the\nproposed merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in\nconnection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.\nFor services rendered in connection with the proposed merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an\naggregate fee of approximately $50 million, $3 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan\ndelivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the consummation of the proposed\nmerger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its\nservices, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities\narising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial\nor investment banking relationships with the Company and DuPont for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have\nreceived customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and\njoint bookrunner on the Company\u2019s credit facility in October 2020. Such services during such period for DuPont have\nincluded acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on credit facilities of DuPont in April 2020 and April 2021,\nacting as joint lead bookrunner on DuPont\u2019s offering of debt securities in April 2020 and acting as a financial advisor\nin connection with the separation of DuPont\u2019s Nutrition and Biosciences business in February 2021 and DuPont\u2019s\nacquisition of Laird Performance Materials in July 2021. During the two-year period preceding delivery of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately $1 million\nand from DuPont were approximately $26 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans\nor other obligations) of the Company or DuPont for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and,\naccordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.",

Hoechner, Mayampurath, Daigle, Knoll, and Gouveia (collectively, the \u201ccovered\nnamed executive officers\u201d or \u201ccovered NEOs\u201d) are parties to the Severance Plan. In order to participate in the\nSeverance Plan, each executive must execute a participation agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) providing\nthat severance payments and benefits provided under the Severance Plan are in lieu of any other severance\npayments or benefits to which they would have been entitled from the Company.\nThe Severance Plan provides benefits to a covered NEO if that NEO (i) is involuntarily terminated by the Company\nfor any reason other than for cause or (ii) terminates his employment with the Company for good reason (each a\n\u201cQualifying Termination\u201d). Benefits under the Severance Plan include:\n\u2022\nfor Mr. Hoechner, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (A) his base salary for the Severance\nPeriod (as defined below), and (B) his target annual bonus, annualized over the duration of the Severance\nPeriod.

If the\nQualifying Termination does not occur within one year after a change in control, the Severance Period is 12\nmonths. If the Qualifying Termination occurs within one year of a change in control, the Severance Period\nis 24 months (with respect to Messrs. Daigle and Knoll) or 18 months (with respect to Messrs. Gouveia and\nMayampurath)\u037e\n\u2022\nsubsidized premium payments for continuation of medical and dental insurance coverage following the\nQualifying Termination for (A) 12 months, or (B) for Mr. Hoechner or if the Qualifying Termination occurs\nwithin one year after a change in control, 18 months\u037e and\n\u2022\nreasonable outplacement services (with a value not to exceed $50,000) during (A) the 12-month period (24-\nmonth period for Mr. Hoechner) immediately following the Qualifying Termination, or (B) if the Qualifying\nTermination occurs within one year after a change in control, the 24-month period (30-month period for Mr.\nHoechner, but not beyond the end of the second calendar year after the Qualifying Termination)\nimmediately following the Qualifying Termination.\nThe Severance Plan also provides benefits to our non-NEO executive officers and certain other officers of the\nCompany, under the same conditions set forth above. Benefits under the Severance Plan for these executives and\nother officers are the same as those provided to Messrs.

Benefits under the Severance Pay Plan Policy include:\n\u2022\na lump-sum cash payment equal to six months of the individual\u2019s base salary\u037e and\n\u2022\nsix months of subsidized premium payments for continuation of medical and dental insurance coverage\nfollowing termination, which the Company may elect to pay in a lump-sum cash payment.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBenefits under the severance plans are also conditioned (i) in the case of the Severance Plan, upon the executive\u2019s\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release and separation agreement and compliance with covenants\nregarding non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, and confidentiality, and (ii) in the case of the\nSeverance Pay Plan Policy, upon the executive's execution of a general release and settlement agreement. The\nestimated aggregate amount of severance payments that would be payable to our executive officers who are not\nnamed executive officers under the severance plans upon the closing of the merger is $2.8 million.\nKey Employee Retention Plan\nAt the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s discretion, non-NEO executives (as well as other key Company employees) are\neligible to participate in the Rogers Corporation Key Employee Retention Plan (the \u201cKERP\u201d). Benefits under the KERP\ninclude cash-based retention awards, which may be granted in the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s discretion in an\naggregate amount for all participants not to exceed $10 million. The KERP is designed to incentivize the retention of\nkey talent through the Effective Time or, if earlier, December 31, 2022, in order to promote continuity of Company\noperations. Benefits under the KERP vest on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, or (ii) an individual\u2019s qualifying\ntermination. In addition, if the Effective Time occurs before either (i) or (ii), 50% of the benefit would vest at the\nEffective Time, and the remainder would vest on the earlier of (i) or (ii). As of the date of this proxy statement, no\nawards or benefits have been allocated or granted under the KERP to any non-NEO executives.\nPension Restoration Plan\nRogers previously maintained the Rogers Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit\npension plan, and currently maintains a non-qualified unfunded pension plan (the \u201cPension Restoration Plan\u201d).\nBenefit accrual under both plans ceased as of June 30, 2013. Benefits under the Pension Restoration Plan are only\npayable in a lump sum. The lump sum amount is calculated using mortality tables applicable to tax qualified plans\nunder IRS rules and an interest rate equal to the average of the annual interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes\nover the five years (as reported on September 1) prior to the year of employment termination plus 20 basis points. In\ngeneral, the benefit under the Pension Restoration Plan is paid six months and one day following the termination of\nemployment, or, if earlier, the benefit is immediately payable on a change in control.\nRogers Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\nRogers Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan is maintained for the benefit of our executive officers. An executive\nofficer may only earn nonqualified deferred compensation by electing to defer receipt of compensation that would\notherwise be payable to him or her in cash. The plan allows participants to elect to defer up to 100% of their annual\nbonus and 50% of their base salary. In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, credit amounts to participants'\naccounts. Accelerated payment may occur upon a change in control that occurs prior to the executive officer\u2019s\ntermination of employment with the Company if so elected by the executive officer prior to the executive officer\u2019s\ncommencement of participation in the plan or a bona fide unforeseen financial hardship. Payments made upon a\nparticipant\u2019s separation from service may be delayed six months, if necessary, to avoid penalties under Internal\nRevenue Code Section 409A.\nFormer Officer\nMr. Michael M. Ludwig retired from his position as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the\nCompany, effective as of May 1, 2021. Mr. Ludwig had an employment or severance agreement with us prior to the\ntermination of his employment with the Company. He is not entitled to severance payments from the Company in\nconnection with the merger and has no economic interests in the merger except insofar as he may hold shares of\nCompany capital stock.\nTax Reimbursements-Gross-Up Agreement\nIn connection with the merger, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board authorized the Company\nto enter into participation agreements with certain employees, including certain of the Company's executive officers,\nand approved the form of such participation agreements (each, a \u201cGross-Up Agreement\u201d). Each Gross-Up Agreement\nprovides that if the employee becomes entitled to payments and benefits in connection with the merger, including\naccelerated vesting of Company equity awards, that are \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d under Sections 280G and 4999\nof the Code, the employee will be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company in an amount\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch that, after payment by the employee of all applicable taxes on the parachute payments and this additional\npayment (including any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the employee will be in the same after-tax\nposition as if no excise tax were imposed on the parachute payments.\nSee the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-",

The amounts included for Mr. Daigle\nreflect the estimated amount of a lump sum payment due upon a change in control under the Pension Restoration Plan. Mr.\nDaigle is the only named executive officer entitled to a benefit under such plan. For further details regarding the Pension\nRestoration Plan, see \u201cSeverance Arrangements\u037e Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger\u201d beginning on page 45.\n(6)\nConsists of the estimated value of continuation coverage of medical and dental insurance benefits for a period of up to 18 months\nif the Qualifying Termination occurs within one year after a change in control and the value of outplacement services the\nCompany would provide to all NEOs.\n(7)\nTax reimbursements consisting of make-whole payments under the Gross-Up Agreements reimburse eligible participants,\nincluding the named executive officers, for the excise tax imposed on the payments and benefits made in connection with the\nmerger to the eligible participants, including the named executive officers, by reason of Section 4999 of the Code. The Gross-Up\nAgreements provide that, if an eligible participant will become entitled to payments and benefits in connection with the merger,\nincluding accelerated vesting of Company equity awards, that are \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d under Sections 280G and 4999 of\nthe Code, the eligible participant will be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company in an amount such that,\nafter payment by the individual of all applicable taxes on the parachute payments and this additional payment (including any\nexcise tax that imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the individual will be in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax\nwere imposed on the parachute payments. Based on the stated assumptions, NEOs shown in the table as receiving no gross-up are\nnot expected to receive payments in an amount that would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the\nCode, and therefore would not receive a gross-up payment. For further details regarding the Gross-Up Agreements, see\n\u201cSeverance Arrangements\u037e Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger\u201d beginning on page 45.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompensation Arrangements with Parent\nExcept as otherwise agreed to in the Merger Agreement, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of the\nCompany\u2019s executive officers have entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding\nemployment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one or\nmore of their affiliates.

An \u201cAcquisition Proposal\u201d means any proposal, offer or\nindication of interest relating to a (i) merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization,\nreorganization, spin-off, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any\nof its subsidiaries and involving, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or\ntotal assets of the Company or (ii) any acquisition of any class of equity securities of the Company or assets of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, in each case, by any person or group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange\nAct) that if consummated would result in such person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or\nindirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity\nsecurities of the Company, or 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the\nCompany. This definition does not include the merger, or any other proposal, offer, or indication of interest made by\nParent or its affiliates and does not include any proposal or offer to the extent related to any purchase of assets\nrequired to be divested in order to obtain governmental approval of the merger.\nIn particular, the Company is restricted from taking any of the following actions:\n\u2022\ninitiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging (including by way of furnishing information relating to the\nCompany) or knowingly taking any action designed to facilitate an Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nengaging in, continuing or otherwise participating in any discussions with or negotiations relating to any\nAcquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nproviding any nonpublic information relating to, or affording access to the business, properties, assets,\nbooks or records of, the Company to any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\notherwise knowingly facilitating any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\ntaking any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover statute, or any restrictive provision of any\napplicable anti-takeover provision in the Company\u2019s organizational documents, inapplicable to any\ntransactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal\u037e or\n\u2022\nresolving, agreeing, authorizing, or committing to do any of the foregoing.\n64TABLE OF CONTENTS\nNotwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company\nreceives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a breach of the restrictions described above\nand the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that,\nbased on the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal, as defined\nbelow, or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may:\n\u2022\nprovide information in response to a request by the person making such Acquisition Proposal (as long as,\nthe Company has, to the extent legally permissible, made such information available to Parent and prior to\nproviding such information to such other person, the Company enters into an agreement with such person\nthat contains confidentiality provisions that are at least as restrictive in the aggregate as the confidentiality\nagreement with Parent)\u037e and\n\u2022\nparticipate in any discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person making the Acquisition\nProposal.\nA \u201cSuperior Proposal\u201d means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except that the references in the definition of\nAcquisition Proposal to \u201c20% or more\u201d will be deemed to be references to \u201c50% or more\u201d) made after the date of the\nMerger Agreement that the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and\nits financial advisor, (i) would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company\u2019s\nshareholders than the merger and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed. Both (i) and (ii)\ntake into account all factors the Board deems relevant, including any legal, financial, regulatory, and shareholder\napproval requirements, the existence of a financing contingency, the timing of closing and any revisions to the terms\nof the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Parent\u2019s rights to propose such revisions, as further\ndiscussed above.\nThe Company must promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four hours give notice to Parent if the Company or any\nof its Representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal and thereafter must keep Parent reasonably informed of the\nstatus and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and discussions or negotiations concerning the material\nterms thereof and as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within twenty-four hours following the receipt or\ndelivery thereof, provide Parent with unredacted copies of any written proposal, proposed transaction agreement or\nother written material that describes the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.\nRestrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Shareholders\nThe Company may not enter into an agreement with another party in respect of an alternative Acquisition Proposal or\nmake a Change of Recommendation except in compliance with the specific requirements of the Merger Agreement, as\ndescribed below. A \u201cChange of Recommendation\u201d includes any of the following actions by the Board:\n\u2022\nwithholding, withdrawing, qualifying, amending or modifying (or publicly proposing or resolving to\nwithhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify) its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger\nSub\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or sent\nor given to shareholders of the Company, failing to issue a press release publicly reaffirming its\nrecommendation within ten business days (or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting)\nfollowing Parent\u2019s written request to do so\u037e\n\u2022\nfailing to include its recommendation in this proxy statement or make or expressly authorize by resolution\nthe making of any public statement by any Company officer or director that is known to, or reasonably\nforeseeable by the Board to have the same consequences as a withdrawal, qualification, amendment or\nmodification of the Company Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement)\u037e\n\u2022\nfailing to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by its shareholders under Rule 14d-2\nof the Exchange Act for outstanding shares of Company capital stock, within ten business days after\nreceipt of a written request of Parent following the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer\n(or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting)\u037e or\n\u2022\napproving or recommending, or publicly declaring advisable or publicly proposing to approve or\nrecommend any Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposing to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum\nof understanding or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNotwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company\nreceives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a material breach of the \u201cNo Solicitation\u201d\nobligations described above, and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel\nand its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company may\neffect a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive written\nagreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. Provided, however, that before taking any action set out in the\nimmediately preceding sentence, the Company must give Parent written notice of such action (and the basis therefor)\nfour business days in advance, the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to\nnegotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior\nProposal and, at the end of four business days from the date of notice to Parent, the Board must determine, after\nconsultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the\nMerger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior\nProposal. Simultaneously with such termination by Parent as a result of a Change of Recommendation or by the\nCompany in order to enter into a definitive written agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay the Company\nTermination Fee, as defined below.\nFurthermore, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation\nif an Intervening Event, as defined below, has occurred and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation\nwith its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response\nto such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable law. However, prior to recommending such Acquisition Proposal, the Board must provide written notice of\nsuch action and the basis therefor four business days in advance (such notice to include a reasonably detailed\ndescription of the Intervening Event), the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent\nwishes to negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement, and the Board must determine in good faith after consultation\nwith its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement proposed in writing by Parent, that such Intervening Event remains in effect and the failure to effect a\nChange of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under applicable law.\n\u201cIntervening Event\u201d means any effect occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that is material to\nthe Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board\nas of or prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material\nconsequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board), which effect, or any material\nconsequence thereof, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the time the Requisite\nCompany Vote is obtained. However, this definition does not include (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any changes in\nthe market price or trading volume of the Company, (iii) the Company meeting, or failing to meet or exceeding\npublished or unpublished revenue or earnings projections in each case, in and of itself, (iv) any changes or\nconditions generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate in, except to the\nextent such effect has a disproportionate effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to\nothers in such industries in respect of the business conducted in such industries or (v) general economic conditions\nor securities, credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United States or any foreign\njurisdiction in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operate, except to the extent such effect has a\ndisproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the\nindustries in which the Company and any of its subsidiaries operate in respect of the business conducted in such\nindustries. In the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the underlying causes of the foregoing may be taken into account in\ndetermining whether an Intervening Event has occurred to the extent not otherwise excluded from this definition.",

MORGAN\n \nNovember 1, 2021\nThe Board of Directors\nRogers Corporation\n2225 West Chandler Boulevard\nChandler, Arizona 85224\nMembers of the Board of Directors:\nYou have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of capital\nstock, par value $1.00 per share (the \u201cCompany Capital Stock\u201d), of Rogers Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) of the\nconsideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) of the Company with a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Dupont de Nemours, Inc. (the \u201cAcquiror\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger\ndated as of November 1, 2021 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), among the Company, the Acquiror and its wholly-owned subsidiary\n(the \u201cAcquisition Sub\u201d), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding\nshare of Company Capital Stock, other than shares of Company Capital Stock held in treasury or owned by the\nAcquiror and its affiliates and Excluded Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to\nreceive $277.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated November 1, 2021 of the Agreement\u037e (ii)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in\nwhich it operates\u037e (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial\nterms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market\nprices of the Company Capital Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v) reviewed\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company\nrelating to its business\u037e and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other\ninformation as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We\nhave not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company, Acquiror or the Acquisition Sub under any state or federal laws\nrelating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or\nderived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the\nbest currently available estimates and judgments by the Company\u2019s management as to the expected future results of\noperations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as\nto such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the\nTransaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the\nAgreement, and that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished\nto us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, Acquiror and the\nAcquisition Sub in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material\nto our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to\nthe Company with respect to such issues.

It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion\nand that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Company\nCapital Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in\nconnection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nthe Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express\nno opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any\nparty to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders\nof shares of Company Capital Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee\nfrom the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed\nTransaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with the Company and Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received\ncustomary compensation. Such services during such period for the Company have included acting as joint lead\narranger and joint bookrunner on the Company\u2019s credit facility in October 2020. Such services during such period for\nthe Acquiror have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on credit facilities of the Acquiror in\nApril 2020 and April 2021, acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Acquiror\u2019s offering of debt securities in April 2020\nand acting as the Acquiror\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the separation and merger of the Acquiror\u2019s\nNutrition and Biosciences business in February 2021 and the Acquiror\u2019s acquisition of Laird Performance Materials\nin July 2021. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit\nfacilities of the Company and the Acquiror for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.\nIn addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock and\ncommon stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror, respectively. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we\nand our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of\ncustomers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial\ninstruments.\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point\nof view, to such holders.\nThe issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This\nletter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the\npurposes of its evaluation of the Transaction.
