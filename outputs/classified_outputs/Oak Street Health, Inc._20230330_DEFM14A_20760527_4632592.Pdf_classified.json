exercise\nprovisions) as applied to the corresponding Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and will become payable in accordance with the original\nvesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Option, except that each Converted Option Cash Award will provide that the unvested portion, if any,\nof such Converted Option Cash Award will immediately vest and become payable upon a

reason\u201d that occurs within the 12-month period following the Effective Time.\nEach Oak Street Health restricted stock unit award (each, an \u201cRSU\u201d) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is vested\nor, as a result of the Merger, would become vested as of the Effective Time (in each case, with any performance conditions applicable to such RSU\ndetermined in accordance with the applicable award agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), will, at the Effective Time, automatically be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of\n(i) $39.00 and (ii) the number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock subject to such RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201cCash-Out\nRSU\u201d).\nEach RSU granted on or after February 7, 2023 that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time will, at the Effective Time, automatically be\nassumed by CVS Pharmacy and converted into a corresponding CVS Health restricted stock unit award (each, an \u201cAssumed RSU Award\u201d) on the same\nterms

the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.\nEach RSU (other than Cash-Out RSUs and RSUs granted on or after February 7, 2023) that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time\nwill, at the Effective

The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will\ndetermine whether a quorum is present. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.\nIf a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is the adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting to\nanother date or time.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of\nOak Street Health common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the close of business on the Record Date. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s\n \n4\nTable of Contents\nfailure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee), as well as abstentions, will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nThe approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock present, in person or represented by proxy. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health common stock deemed not in attendance at\nthe Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such\nholder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Compensation Proposal. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding and is not a condition to the\ncompletion of the Merger.\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Oak Street Health\ncommon stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter. Accordingly, shares of Oak Street Health common stock deemed\nnot in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting\ninstructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d? \nIf a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee does not provide the\norganization that holds the owner\u2019s shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares\nof Oak Street Health common stock may generally vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters but cannot vote on \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker\nnon-vote\u201d results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide\ndiscretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not\nreceived specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Oak Street Health does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special\nMeeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that\nare considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or\nother nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions from you.\nFailure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment\nProposal.\nHow does the Oak Street Health Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Oak Street Health Board unanimously recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Oak Street Health Board considered in determining to recommend that Oak Street Health stockholders adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board and\nReasons for the Merger.\u201d In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Oak Street Health Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you\nshould be aware that certain of Oak Street Health\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of Oak Street Health stockholders generally. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Interests of Oak Street Health\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n \n5\nTable of Contents\nWhy am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may become payable to the named executive\nofficers of Oak Street Health in connection with the Merger?\nThe SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted rules that require Oak Street Health\nto seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to the named executive officers of Oak Street Health in\nconnection with the Merger.\nWhat will happen if Oak Street Health stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?\nThe vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the vote on the\nCompensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Oak Street Health, the Oak Street Health Board, CVS Pharmacy or the surviving\ncorporation. Accordingly, because Oak Street Health is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Oak\nStreet Health stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless\nof the outcome of this advisory, non-binding vote.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Oak Street Health common stock before the Special Meeting?\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of Oak Street Health\ncommon stock after the close of business on the Record Date, but before the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Special\nMeeting. However, the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares of Oak Street Health\ncommon stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Oak Street Health common\nstock through the Effective Time.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Oak Street Health common stock. The written document describing the\nmatters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used by Oak Street stockholders of record to\ndesignate a proxy to vote their shares of Oak Street Health common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nIf an Oak Street Health stockholder of record gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares of Oak\nStreet Health common stock in the way that you indicate. When voting over the Internet or by telephone or by the proxy card, you may specify whether\nyour shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the proposals\npresented at the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted on\none or more proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger\nProposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if I am an Oak Street Health stockholder of record?\nIf your shares of Oak Street Health common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement and your proxy card\nhave been sent directly to you by Oak Street Health.\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nIf you are an Oak Street Health stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date, you may vote by submitting your proxy over\nthe Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid reply envelope. You may also vote your\nshares of Oak Street Health common stock electronically during the Special Meeting.

For more detailed\ninstructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Voting\nProcedures.\u201d\nIf you are an Oak Street Health stockholder of record and you return a properly signed proxy card but do not direct how to vote your shares of\nOak Street Health common stock on one or more of the proposals to be brought before the Special Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote your\nshares of Oak Street Health common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee?\nIf your shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of Oak Street Health common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or\nother nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Oak Street Health stockholder of record.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive a voting instruction form from\nyour broker, bank, or other nominee seeking instruction from you as to how your shares of Oak Street Health common stock should be voted.

Without providing those instructions, your shares of Oak Street Health common stock will not\nbe voted, which will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation\nProposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf my shares of Oak Street Health common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee, what will happen if I abstain from\nvoting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nIf you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or fail to give voting instructions to your\nbank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment\nProposal.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give voting instructions to your bank, broker or\nother nominee will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?\nYes.

For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nAm I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?\nIf the Merger is completed, Oak Street Health stockholders who continuously hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the Effective\nTime, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\n \n8\nTable of Contents\nAgreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and do not withdraw their demands, and who otherwise\ncomply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock\nin connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Oak Street Health stockholders are entitled to have their shares of Oak\nStreet Health common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the\namount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding).\nOak Street Health stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as\ndetermined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the\nMerger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Oak Street Health stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of\ntheir shares of Oak Street Health common stock are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal\nrights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in\nadditional detail in this proxy statement, and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly\navailable website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in a\ntimely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. See the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cAppraisal Rights.\u201d\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect to complete the Merger in 2023. However, the exact\ntiming of completion of the Merger cannot be accurately predicted because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, waiver) of the conditions to CVS Pharmacy, Merger Sub and Oak Street Health\u2019s respective obligations to consummate the Merger, some\nof which are not within the parties\u2019 control.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Oak Street Health?\nIf the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Oak Street Health, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will\nthereupon cease, and Oak Street Health will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Pharmacy. Following completion\nof the Merger, shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Oak Street Health common\nstock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Oak Street Health stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of Oak Street Health common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Oak Street Health will remain an\nindependent public company and stockholders will continue to own their shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Oak Street Health common stock will\ncontinue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the NYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Oak\nStreet Health may be obligated to pay to CVS Health a termination fee. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, CVS Health may be\nobligated to pay to Oak Street Health a termination fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\n\u2014 Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\n \n9\nTable of Contents\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to two or more stockholders that share the same last name and household\nmailing address, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if a company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. The following chronology\ndoes not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Oak Street Health Board, the Transaction Committee or the representatives of Oak Street\nHealth, CVS Health or their respective advisors and other parties.\nThe Oak Street Health Board, together with Oak Street Health senior management, and with the assistance of its outside legal and financial\nadvisors, regularly reviews and assesses Oak Street Health\u2019s financial performance and long-term strategic plans and objectives in light of developments\nin Oak Street Health\u2019s business, the industries in which it operates, and economic, market and industry conditions generally. These reviews and\nassessments have included, among other things, engagement in strategic discussions with participants in the healthcare industry and other market\nparticipants, consideration of various potential strategic opportunities, including continuing as a standalone company with organic growth initiatives,\nacquisitions of other companies or businesses in, or adjacent to, the industries in which Oak Street Health operates and other potential strategic\nalternatives, in each case, with a view towards enhancing stockholder value and delivering the highest quality care to patients.\nIn connection with reviewing and assessing these possible strategic discussions and other opportunities, Oak Street Health has periodically\nsought the advice of Centerview, based on Centerview\u2019s qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of Oak Street Health\u2019s business and\naffairs and the industries in which it operates.\nIn late October 2021, at the suggestion of Centerview, an introduction of Mr. Mike Pykosz, Chief Executive Officer of Oak Street Health, and Mr. Tim\nCook, Chief Financial Officer of Oak Street Health, to Mr. Shawn Guertin, Chief Financial Officer of CVS Health, was facilitated by Centerview. This\nintroduction led to an in-person meeting on December 10, 2021, held at the headquarters of CVS Health in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, among Messrs.\nPykosz, Cook, and Guertin. At this meeting, Mr. Pykosz and Mr. Cook provided a general overview of Oak Street Health\u2019s business, the market in which it\noperates and potential growth opportunities for the business. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, and Guertin also discussed, at a high level, the potential benefits of\na strategic partnership between the two companies and agreed to stay in touch. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with\nrespect to any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the meeting.\n \n25Table of Contents\nOn January 28, 2022, Mr. Guertin contacted Messrs. Pykosz and Cook to discuss Oak Street Health\u2019s performance in light of the presentation given\nby Oak Street Health at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 10, 2022. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, and Guertin agreed to schedule an operational\ndiscussion among representatives of both companies to continue to explore whether a potential commercial partnership or other strategic transaction\nwould be beneficial to both companies and their respective stockholders. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect\nto any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the discussion.\nOn March 21, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook attended an introductory meeting by videoconference with Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President,\nCapital Markets of CVS Health. At such meeting, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook agreed to provide CVS Health with the materials prepared for Oak Street\nHealth\u2019s investor day hosted on March 16, 2022. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or\nother strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the meeting.\nOn September 21, 2022, a meeting was held by videoconference among Mr. Cook, Geoffrey Price, Chief Innovation Officer of Oak Street Health, and\ncertain representatives of CVS Health, during which representatives of CVS Health asked a number of questions relating to, among other things, Oak\nStreet Health\u2019s operating model, provider structure, growth strategy, technology capabilities (including with respect to its proprietary Canopy platform),\nand payor relationships. During this meeting, representatives of CVS Health expressed a potential interest in acquiring Oak Street Health. However, no\nproposal was made by CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any acquisition or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street\nHealth during the meeting. The representatives of Oak Street Health and CVS Health agreed to discuss Oak Street Health\u2019s business further at a later date,\nincluding with CVS Health\u2019s financial advisors.\nOn September 26, 2022, in response to increased merger and acquisition activity in the value-based primary care market, Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement contacted representatives of Centerview to ask them to prepare a presentation to be delivered at the Oak Street Health Board\u2019s regularly\nscheduled monthly business review session to take place on September 28, 2022.\nOn September 28, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled monthly business review session, during which representatives of\nCenterview presented an overview of current market conditions, including with respect to mergers and acquisitions activity, with a focus on primary care\nassets. During this meeting, the Oak Street Health Board discussed the healthcare industry broadly and the increased interest by strategic acquirors in\nacquiring primary care assets. During the review session, after representatives of Centerview had left the meeting, it was noted to the Oak Street Health\nBoard that Messrs. Cook and Price had taken part in a meeting with representatives of CVS Health the week prior, in which representatives of CVS Health\nhad expressed a potential interest in acquiring Oak Street Health, but that no proposal was made by either company.\nOn October 6, 2022, representatives of CVS Health contacted representatives of Centerview to schedule a discussion on October 7, 2022, to take\nplace in advance of a discussion scheduled for the following week among representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective financial\nadvisors.\nOn October 7, 2022, Bloomberg published an article reporting that CVS Health was in exclusive talks to acquire a different primary care provider.\nThe scheduled call among representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective financial advisors was subsequently cancelled.\nRepresentatives of Centerview contacted Mr. Cowhey to confirm whether this news impacted any discussions with Oak Street Health. Mr. Cowhey\nindicated to representatives of Centerview that he would reach out directly to representatives of Oak Street Health to discuss this issue.\nOn October 10, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to inform him that CVS Health continued to be interested in a potential acquisition of Oak Street\nHealth and that it would be mutually beneficial for both\n \n26\nTable of Contents\ncompanies to further explore the opportunity. No proposal was made by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or other\nstrategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health during the call. Additionally, Mr. Cowhey indicated that Karen Lynch, President and\nChief Executive Officer of CVS Health, would contact Mr. Pykosz to discuss CVS Health\u2019s interest in a strategic transaction with Oak Street Health.\nOn October 14, 2022, Ms. Lynch called Mr. Pykosz to reiterate CVS Health\u2019s interest in pursuing further discussions with Oak Street Health\nregarding a potential transaction. During this discussion, Ms. Lynch and Mr. Pykosz discussed, among other things, the potential strategic benefits of a\ncombination of both companies. Mr. Pykosz indicated to Ms. Lynch that while the Oak Street Health Board was not actively contemplating a sale of the\ncompany, the Oak Street Health Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create value for Oak Street Health\u2019s stockholders. Mr. Pykosz and\nMs. Lynch tentatively scheduled a site tour of an Oak Street Health primary care center located in Rhode Island for October 18, 2022. No proposal was\nmade by either CVS Health or Oak Street Health with respect to any partnership or other strategic transaction between CVS Health and Oak Street Health\nduring the call.\nOn October 18, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook provided Ms. Lynch, Mr. Cowhey and Dr. Amar Desai, President, Health Care Delivery of CVS\nHealth, with a tour of an Oak Street Health primary care center located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, during which Messrs. Pykosz and Cook responded\nto questions from the representatives of CVS Health regarding Oak Street Health\u2019s business and potential growth opportunities. In addition, the\nrepresentatives of Oak Street Health and CVS Health discussed potential strategic opportunities resulting from a combination of the businesses, but no\nspecific terms were discussed.\nOn October 28, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to inform him that CVS Health and its advisors were continuing to evaluate the financial impact\nof a potential combination of the two companies, and indicated that CVS Health intended to submit a preliminary indication of interest to acquire Oak\nStreet Health between November 4, 2022 and November 7, 2022, but did not propose any specific terms.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s\nsenior management, during which, among other things, Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management provided an update on Oak Street Health\u2019s financial and\noperational performance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz also informed the Oak Street Health Board of the inbound interest from CVS Health, the status\nof the preliminary conversations among Messrs. Pykosz and Cook and members of CVS Health\u2019s senior management, and the forthcoming indication of\ninterest from CVS Health expected over the course of the following week. During this meeting, the Oak Street Health Board also resolved to form a special\nad-hoc transaction committee (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) for purposes of efficiency only, and not to address any actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. Mr. Pykosz, Robbert Vorhoff, Paul Kusserow and Kim Keck, each of whom had significant experience with mergers and acquisitions transactions,\nwere appointed to the Transaction Committee. The Oak Street Health Board authorized the Transaction Committee to provide management and advisors\nwith evaluation and oversight from the Transaction Committee (on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board) should an indication of interest from CVS\nHealth be received and to provide timely input from the Transaction Committee (on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board) on any issues relating to any\npotential transaction on an ongoing basis\u037e provided that any potential transaction involving Oak Street Health would need to be approved by the full\nOak Street Health Board. Throughout the Transaction Committee\u2019s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, the Transaction Committee conducted\nseveral formal meetings, but its members were also in regular contact with Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management and legal and financial advisors and\nwith one another. Additionally, the Oak Street Health Board discussed Centerview\u2019s existing relationship and familiarity with Oak Street Health, reputation\nas a highly regarded investment bank and advisory firm, substantial knowledge of the industry in which Oak Street Health operates and extensive\nexperience in providing financial advice in connection with strategic transactions. The Oak Street Health Board authorized Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement to formally engage Centerview as a financial advisor to advise on any transaction with potential strategic acquirors.\n \n27\nTable of Contents\nOn November 2, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook called representatives of Centerview to update them on the discussions with CVS Health since\nOctober 7, 2022, and to seek to engage Centerview to advise Oak Street Health in advance of receiving an indication of interest from CVS Health in the\ncoming days and to evaluate other strategic alternatives.\nOn November 7, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and\nCowhey conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Oak Street Health at a price of $28.00 per share (the \u201cInitial Proposal\u201d). Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would communicate this Initial\nProposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but shared his view with Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that he believed that the Initial Proposal significantly\nundervalued Oak Street Health\u2019s business and expected that it was unlikely that the Oak Street Health Board would engage in discussions about a\npotential transaction at this price. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey suggested that Oak Street Health consider entering into a confidentiality agreement with\nCVS Health to allow CVS Health to conduct additional due diligence and potentially increase its proposal.\nOn November 8, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Mr. Cook and Robert Guenthner, Chief Legal Officer of\nOak Street Health, also in attendance, to discuss the terms of the Initial Proposal. After discussing the Initial Proposal, the Transaction Committee\ndetermined that the Initial Proposal undervalued Oak Street Health\u2019s business and it was not in the best interests of Oak Street Health\u2019s stockholders for\nthe Oak Street Health Board to engage with CVS Health on a potential transaction at this price, and instructed senior management to inform CVS Health\naccordingly.\nOn November 9, 2022, Mr. Cook called Mr. Cowhey to convey the message from the Transaction Committee. Mr. Cowhey reiterated that CVS Health\ncould potentially be in a position to make a proposal at a higher price with the benefit of additional information made available pursuant to a\nconfidentiality agreement.\nOn November 14, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and\nCowhey conveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a revised verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Oak Street Health for a price ranging from $34.00 to $36.00 per share (the \u201cSecond Proposal\u201d). Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey\nfurther indicated that they were optimistic that, after signing a confidentiality agreement and conducting additional due diligence on non-public\ninformation, CVS Health hoped to be able to increase its proposal to reflect a \u201chigh $30\u2019s per share\u201d valuation. Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would\ncommunicate the Second Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but shared his view that the Second Proposal continued to undervalue Oak Street\nHealth\u2019s business and also expected that it was unlikely that the Oak Street Health Board would engage in discussions about a potential transaction at\nthis price.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Messrs. Cook and Guenthner also in attendance, to\ndiscuss the terms of the Second Proposal and CVS Health\u2019s expressed belief that with additional due diligence on non-public information, it hoped to be\nable to increase its proposal to reflect a \u201chigh $30s per share\u201d valuation of Oak Street Health. The Transaction Committee discussed the underlying\nrationale for the Second Proposal and potential responses to the Second Proposal. The Transaction Committee directed Oak Street Health senior\nmanagement to arrange a call with Centerview to discuss potential responses to the Second Proposal.\nOn November 17, 2022, the Transaction Committee held another meeting by videoconference, with Messrs. Cook and Guenthner and\nrepresentatives of Centerview also in attendance, to continue its discussion with respect to the terms of the Second Proposal. Representatives of\nCenterview discussed with the Transaction Committee potential responses to the Second Proposal and recommended that Oak Street consider\nsimultaneously reaching out to other strategic parties who may have the resources and interest in considering a transaction with Oak Street Health. After\nconsultation with representatives of Centerview, the Transaction Committee instructed Oak Street\n \n28\nTable of Contents\nHealth\u2019s senior management to inform CVS Health that the proposed valuation of Oak Street Health in the Second Proposal was insufficient, but that Oak\nStreet Health would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with CVS Health to share certain financial due diligence information and hold\nmeetings with CVS Health to further discuss Oak Street Health\u2019s business and any potential synergies resulting from a combination, in order to enable\nCVS Health to increase its proposal. The Transaction Committee also determined that it was in the best interests of Oak Street Health and its stockholders\nto simultaneously initiate a limited exploratory process to evaluate whether other strategic parties might also have an interest in a potential strategic\ntransaction involving Oak Street Health. The Transaction Committee agreed with Centerview\u2019s recommendation that Centerview, on behalf of Oak Street\nHealth, conduct a targeted and confidential outreach to a select group of other potential strategic acquirors identified as the parties most likely to be\ninterested in exploring a transaction with Oak Street Health based on their perceived and/or expressed interest in the primary care provider space and their\nfinancial capability to consummate a transaction involving Oak Street Health, with the proposed outreach to be further discussed at the upcoming\nmeeting of the Oak Street Health Board.\nOn November 18, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed\nthe message from the Transaction Committee to Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey. Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey agreed to schedule a meeting\nduring the week of November 28, 2022, in advance of which a confidentiality agreement would be executed, to further discuss Oak Street Health\u2019s\nbusiness and any potential synergies resulting from a combination, in order to enable CVS Health to increase its proposal.\nOn November 19, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board with an update\non the discussions with CVS Health, including the terms of the Second Proposal and CVS Health\u2019s expressed belief that with additional due diligence, it\nhoped to be able to increase its proposal to reflect a \u201chigh $30s per share\u201d valuation of Oak Street Health. Representatives of Centerview reviewed with\nthe Oak Street Health Board its recommended approach, previously discussed with the Transaction Committee, to conduct a targeted and confidential\noutreach, on behalf of Oak Street Health, to a select group of potential strategic acquirers, identified as the parties most likely to be interested in exploring\na transaction with Oak Street Health based on their perceived and/or expressed interest in the primary care provider space and their financial capability to\nconsummate a transaction involving Oak Street Health. The outreach would allow the Oak Street Health Board to gauge potential interest in a transaction\nwith Oak Street Health and preliminary views of potential valuation while, at the same time, continuing discussions with CVS Health. The Oak Street\nHealth Board approved Centerview\u2019s outreach proposal and instructed Centerview to commence such outreach.\nOn November 20, 2022, at the direction of the Oak Street Health Board, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of four potential\nstrategic acquirors (referred to herein as \u201cParty A\u201d, \u201cParty B\u201d, \u201cParty C\u201d and \u201cParty D\u201d) by email to offer them the opportunity to enter into a\nconfidentiality agreement and receive certain due diligence information if they were interested in a potential transaction with Oak Street Health.\nOver the course of November 21, 2022 and November 22, 2022, representatives of Party A, Party B and Party C indicated that they were interested\nin a potential transaction involving Oak Street Health and requested a copy of the draft confidentiality agreement.\nBeginning on November 21, 2022, Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management team prepared preliminary financial projections for the remainder of fiscal\nyear 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2028 for use in connection with a potential strategic process.

The confidentiality agreement included\ncustomary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a customary standstill provision.

Mr. Pykosz indicated that he\n \n30\nTable of Contents\nwould communicate the Third Proposal to the Oak Street Health Board, but noted that he expected that the valuation of Oak Street Health contemplated\nby the Third Proposal was still likely lower than a value that the Oak Street Health Board would consider acceptable.\nAlso on December 7, 2022, Centerview submitted a relationship disclosure letter to the Oak Street Health Board, and the Oak Street Health Board\ndetermined on this basis that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of Centerview to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor\nto Oak Street Health.\nAlso on December 7, 2022, discussions with representatives of Party A regarding a potential transaction involving Oak Street Health terminated\ndue to Party A\u2019s other competing priorities.\nOn December 9, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Centerview and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), outside counsel to Oak Street Health, in attendance.

The Transaction Committee, together with the other attendees, discussed the terms of the Third Proposal and\nvarious potential approaches regarding CVS Health and the other potential strategic acquirors, including timing considerations. Representatives of\nCenterview reviewed the terms of the Third Proposal with the Oak Street Health Board in the context of their preliminary financial analyses based on,\namong other things, publicly available Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates regarding Oak Street Health and the Projections, as well as\nproposed alternatives to respond to the Third Proposal. The Transaction Committee determined to recommend to the Oak Street Health Board that Oak\nStreet Health\u2019s senior management communicate a $43.00 per share counterproposal to CVS Health. The Transaction Committee, consistent with the\nrecommendation of Centerview, requested Centerview to call Party B ahead of receiving its proposal and provide more specific guidance on expected\nvaluation in light of CVS Health\u2019s Third Proposal.\nOn December 11, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board\nwith an update on the status of ongoing discussions with CVS Health regarding a potential transaction, including receipt of the Third Proposal, and the\nstatus of Centerview\u2019s outreach to Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D. Representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board its\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law in these circumstances and discussed certain considerations for the Oak Street Health Board when evaluating a\npotential sale of Oak Street Health. Representatives of Centerview discussed the terms of the Third Proposal in the context of their preliminary financial\nanalyses based on, among other things, publicly available Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates regarding Oak Street Health and the\nProjections. Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management led a discussion on opportunities available to Oak Street Health for future growth and risks of\ncontinuing as a standalone business, given current market conditions and the competitive landscape for Oak Street Health. Representatives of\nCenterview then presented the proposed approach with respect to CVS Health and Party B as endorsed by the Transaction Committee on December 9,\n2022. The Oak Street Health Board discussed these items in significant detail, as well as a number of potential scenarios and timelines for a potential\ntransaction. Following such discussion, the Oak Street Health Board determined to deliver to CVS Health a counterproposal of $43.00 per share in\nresponse to the Third Proposal and instructed Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management to convey the same on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board.\nOn December 13, 2022, representatives of Centerview delivered to the Oak Street Health Board an updated relationship disclosure letter, and Oak\nStreet Health\u2019s senior management determined on this basis that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of Centerview to fulfill its\nresponsibilities as financial advisor to Oak Street Health. Also on December 13, 2022, Oak Street Health and Centerview executed an engagement letter.\n \n31\nTable of Contents\nOn December 13, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed\nto Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that the Oak Street Health Board was unwilling to transact at $38.00 per share, but would be willing to proceed to the next\nstep of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $43.00 per share. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey agreed to review this counterproposal with\nCVS Health senior management and the CVS Health Board.\nOn December 16, 2022, Mr. Cowhey called Mr. Cook to provide an update on CVS Health\u2019s ongoing diligence work and indicated to Mr. Cook that\ninternal discussions regarding Oak Street Health\u2019s counterproposal were ongoing.\nOn December 19, 2022, during a videoconference meeting attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey\nconveyed to Messrs. Pykosz and Cook, on behalf of CVS Health, a further revised verbal, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Oak Street Health for $40.00 per share (the \u201cFourth Proposal\u201d). Mr. Pykosz indicated that he would communicate the Fourth\nProposal to the Oak Street Health Board.\nAlso on December 19, 2022, Party B indicated to representatives of Centerview that it would consider a transaction to acquire Oak Street Health in a\nrange of $31.00 to $32.00 per share, but that it did not see a pathway to increasing its valuation beyond the \u201cmid $30s\u201d per share range.\nLater on December 19, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board\nwith a detailed update on the ongoing discussions with CVS Health, including receipt of the Fourth Proposal. Representatives of Centerview provided\nthe Oak Street Health Board with an update on discussions with Party B and shared Party B\u2019s indication that it had limited potential for improving its offer\nbeyond the \u201cmid $30s\u201d per share range. Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management noted that while there was a possibility that through additional diligence,\nParty B could eventually be in a position to offer beyond the \u201cmid $30s\u201d per share range, it was not clear whether Party B would be in a position to offer a\nvalue comparable to the Fourth Proposal, and even if Party B were to offer a value comparable to the Fourth Proposal, Party B was considerably less\nadvanced than CVS Health in its diligence, was advocating for a less attractive transaction structure for Oak Street Health\u2019s business and a transaction\nwith Party B potentially presented more regulatory risk than with CVS Health. In light of these considerations, the Oak Street Health Board instructed\nCenterview to convey to Party B that its preliminary proposal was not at a level that properly reflected Oak Street Health\u2019s value and report back to the\nOak Street Health Board for discussion of any response from Party B to this information. Representatives of Centerview then discussed their\nperspectives on the Fourth Proposal in the context of their previously discussed preliminary financial analyses and discussed potential responses to the\nFourth Proposal in light of the fact that at such time no other party had expressed interest in a transaction with Oak Street Health at a comparable value.\nRepresentatives of Kirkland provided an overview of the relevant regulatory considerations for the transaction. The Oak Street Health Board aligned on\nconveying to CVS Health that the Oak Street Health Board would be prepared to move forward to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential\ntransaction at $41.00 per share, provided that the transaction includes strong commitments from CVS Health on regulatory matters. The Oak Street Health\nBoard instructed Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management to convey this response to CVS Health on behalf of the Oak Street Health Board. Oak Street\nHealth\u2019s senior management then reviewed with the Oak Street Health Board the final terms of the engagement letter entered into with Centerview on\nDecember 13, 2022. The Oak Street Health Board agreed with the determination by Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management, on the basis of the updated\nrelationship disclosure letter provided by Centerview on December 13, 2022, that there were no conflicts of interest that would affect the ability of\nCenterview to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to Oak Street Health. Following discussion, the Oak Street Health Board expressed its\nagreement with the terms of the engagement letter.\nOn December 20, 2022, during a meeting held by videoconference attended by Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey, Mr. Pykosz conveyed\nto Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey that the Oak Street Health Board\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nwould be prepared to move forward to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $41.00 per share, provided that the\ntransaction included strong commitments from CVS Health on regulatory matters. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey indicated that they would communicate\nthis response to the CVS Health Board.\nLater on December 20, 2022, Messrs. Pykosz, Cook, Guertin and Cowhey reconvened and Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey communicated that the CVS\nHealth Board was also prepared to move forward expeditiously to the next step of evaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at $41.00 per share\ncontingent upon Oak Street Health entering into exclusivity with CVS Health for 45 days in order to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive\ntransaction documents with respect to a potential acquisition. Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey indicated that the CVS Health Board would not agree to\ntransact at any price above $41.00 per share. Mr. Pykosz noted that he would discuss the proposed exclusivity period with the Oak Street Health Board.\nLater on December 20, 2022, representatives of Centerview contacted Party B to indicate that the Oak Street Health Board was not willing to\nproceed with a transaction at the valuation proposed by Party B.\nLater on December 20, 2022, Mr. Cowhey sent Mr. Cook a draft exclusivity agreement.\nOn December 21, 2022, representatives of Party C contacted representatives of Centerview to inform them that Party C would not be submitting a\nproposal to acquire Oak Street Health, noting that an acquisition of Oak Street Health was inconsistent with its strategic priorities.\nAlso on December 21, 2022, the Oak Street Health Board held a regularly scheduled monthly business review session by videoconference, with\nmembers of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Cook\nprovided the Oak Street Health Board with a business update on the financial performance of Oak Street Health. Mr. Pykosz then provided the Oak Street\nHealth Board with a detailed update on the ongoing discussions with CVS Health, including CVS Health\u2019s willingness to proceed to the next step of\nevaluating and negotiating a potential transaction at a price of $41.00 per share contingent upon Oak Street Health entering into an exclusivity agreement\nwith CVS Health for a period of 45 days for purposes of negotiating such a transaction. Representatives of Centerview also provided an update on\ndiscussions with Party B, and the status of outreach to Party A and Party C. The Oak Street Health Board discussed the benefits and drawbacks of\nexclusivity (including, in light of the fact that there was currently no other interested party willing to propose a transaction at a comparable value\n(including following Centerview\u2019s outreach)). Following discussion, the Oak Street Health Board approved entering into an exclusivity agreement with\nCVS Health for an initial 30-day exclusivity period, with an automatic extension in certain circumstances.\nOn December 22, 2022, Oak Street Health and CVS Health executed the exclusivity agreement reflecting the exclusivity period approved by the Oak\nStreet Health Board during the December 21, 2022 meeting.\nAlso on December 22, 2022, CVS Health was provided with access to a virtual data room with additional diligence information regarding Oak Street\nHealth.\nOn December 23, 2022, Kirkland provided the Oak Street Health Board a summary of the key terms of the initial draft of the Merger Agreement\nproposed to be sent to CVS Health. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, a regulatory efforts covenant that\nrequired CVS Health to take all actions necessary to obtain all regulatory clearances (including divestitures and other remedies) up to the level of a\nmaterial adverse effect on the combined company (measured as if the combined company was the size of Oak Street Health), restrictions on CVS Health\u2019s\nability to enter into transactions which would prevent, delay or impede obtaining regulatory clearance for the transaction, and entry into customary\nvoting agreements with the Specified Stockholders, which collectively held approximately 45% of Oak Street Health\u2019s shares of common stock at such\ntime.\n \n33\nTable of Contents\nOn December 26, 2022, Oak Street Health and CVS Health executed a separate \u201cclean team\u201d agreement, pursuant to which it was agreed that certain\ncompetitively sensitive information of Oak Street Health and CVS Health would only be shared with a specified subset of the representatives of Oak\nStreet Health and CVS Health.\nAlso on December 26, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Shearman & Sterling LLP\n(\u201cShearman\u201d), outside counsel to CVS Health. Between December 23, 2022 and January 20, 2023, and again between February 3, 2023 and February 7,\n2023, representatives of Kirkland, Shearman, Dechert LLP (\u201cDechert\u201d), outside antitrust counsel to CVS Health, and McDermott Will & Emery LLP\n(\u201cMcDermott\u201d), outside healthcare regulatory counsel to CVS Health, and members of Oak Street Health\u2019s and CVS Health\u2019s respective senior\nmanagement teams engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement. Among other items in the draft Merger\nAgreement, representatives of Oak Street Health, CVS Health and their respective legal counsel negotiated (i) the efforts required by the parties to obtain\nregulatory clearance, including restrictions on CVS Health entering into transactions in the same line of business as Oak Street Health that could\nreasonably be expected to materially delay or materially increase the risk of not obtaining the required regulatory clearance for the transaction, (ii) the\nquantum of the reverse termination fee payable by CVS Health to Oak Street Health if regulatory clearance for the transaction is not obtained and the\ncircumstances in which such fee would be payable, (iii) the non-solicitation provision that prohibits Oak Street Health from soliciting and negotiating with\nthird parties to enter into an agreement for an alternative business combination transaction and the related termination rights and termination fee payable\nby Oak Street Health, (iv) the treatment of outstanding Oak Street Health equity awards and covenants regarding employee benefit matters applicable to\nCompany employees, and (iv) Oak Street Health\u2019s representations, warranties and interim operating covenants.\nOn December 31, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent an initial draft of the form of Voting Agreement to representatives of Kirkland. This draft\nwas shared by Kirkland with respective outside counsel to General Atlantic and Newlight. Between December 31, 2022 and January 20, 2023, and again\nbetween February 3, 2023 and February 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland and Shearman engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the\nform of Voting Agreement.\nOn January 4, 2023, representatives of Shearman sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Kirkland.\nOn January 6, 2023, a member of the Oak Street Health Board met with Dr. Desai for general business purposes unrelated to a potential transaction\ninvolving Oak Street Health and CVS Health. During this meeting, Dr. Desai expressed his excitement about a potential combination of the two companies\nand the member of Oak Street Health Board shared such member\u2019s views on the strength of Oak Street Health\u2019s business and the management team.\nOn January 7, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board\nwith a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including CVS Health\u2019s desire to be in a position to announce a\ndefinitive transaction before the opening of the U.S. stock markets on January 23, 2023. The Oak Street Health Board then discussed a request from CVS\nHealth to discuss post-closing continuity of leadership with Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management. Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management agreed that\nit would not have any such discussions with CVS Health until the Oak Street Health Board provided its approval. In an executive session (which Mr.\nPykosz did not attend), the directors determined that the retention discussions with Oak Street Health senior management requested by CVS Health\nshould only occur following confirmation from CVS Health that it was prepared to proceed at a specific value and alignment with CVS Health on timing to\nsigning a definitive agreement.\nOn January 9, 2023, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook gave a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, during which they shared positive\nupdates to the Company\u2019s fiscal year 2022 results and guidance\n \n34\nTable of Contents\nfor fiscal year 2023. That same day, after close of U.S. stock markets, Bloomberg published an article reporting that CVS Health was exploring an\nacquisition of Oak Street Health in a deal that would value Oak Street Health at more than $10 billion, including debt. Oak Street Health\u2019s stock opened at\n$29.77 per share on the morning of January 10, 2023, as compared to its closing price of $22.57 on January 9, 2023.\nOn January 11, 2023, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft of the Oak Street Health disclosure letter to representatives of Shearman.\nBetween January 11, 2023 and February 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland, Shearman, Dechert and McDermott and members of Oak Street Health\u2019s and\nCVS Health\u2019s respective management teams engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Oak Street Health disclosure letter and other\ntransaction documents.\nOn January 17, 2023, Ms. Lynch contacted Mr. Pykosz and informed him that the CVS Health Board was no longer willing to proceed at $41.00 per\nshare and was reducing its proposed value to $38.00 per share, and indicated that such reduction was due to the concentration level of payor-affiliated\ncenters, but that CVS Health otherwise remained committed to pursuing a transaction with Oak Street Health. Mr. Pykosz responded that he would\nconvey the reduced price and articulated rationale for the reduction to the Oak Street Health Board.\nLater on January 17, 2023, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook discussed with Messrs. Guertin and Cowhey CVS Health\u2019s rationale for the proposed price\nreduction, including CVS Health\u2019s methodology for calculating the price reduction. During the meeting, Messrs. Pykosz and Cook expressed their views\nthat CVS Health\u2019s concerns with respect to Oak Street Health\u2019s payors and associated price reduction represented an unwarranted reduction in value.\nAlso on January 17, 2023, representatives of Centerview confirmed to representatives of Kirkland and Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management that\nthere were no changes to the relationship disclosure letter provided to the Oak Street Health Board on December 13, 2022.\nOn January 18, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance. During the meeting, Mr. Pykosz provided the Oak Street Health Board\nwith a detailed update on the status of the potential transaction with CVS Health, including CVS Health\u2019s proposed price reduction and the views of the\nTransaction Committee members shared with Mr. Pykosz prior to this meeting that Oak Street Health should continue to engage in discussions with CVS\nHealth to determine if agreement could be reached on a transaction at a value that was in the best interests of Oak Street Health stockholders. The Oak\nStreet Health Board also discussed potential implications and risks of a deal not being completed, particularly in light of market rumors and the continuing\nrisks to the business on a standalone basis.

Ms. Lynch agreed to discuss this counterproposal with the CVS Health Board.\nOn January 20, 2023, Ms. Lynch contacted Mr. Pykosz to inform him that the CVS Health Board had certain concerns with moving forward with the\npotential transaction on the agreed timeline (which, at the time, contemplated an announcement on or around January 23, 2023), due to the proximity to\nthe pending Medicare Advantage (MA) Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) Program Final Rule (Final Rule) (the \u201cRADV Final Rule\u201d) expected to be\nannounced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) on or around February 1, 2023. Ms. Lynch communicated to Mr. Pykosz the CVS\nHealth Board\u2019s desire to postpone entry into any definitive transaction until after the announcement of the RADV Final Rule in light of such concerns.\nMr. Pykosz and Ms. Lynch discussed the potential impact of the RADV Final Rule on Oak Street Health\u2019s business, and Ms. Lynch proposed that any\ntransaction subsequently entered into be at a price of $39.00 per share. Mr. Pykosz then indicated that he would communicate the revised transaction\nterms and timing proposed by CVS Health to the Oak Street Health Board.\nLater on January 20, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance.

The Oak Street Health Board further discussed a number of external risks that could impact Oak Street Health\u2019s business going forward as\nwell as opportunities and risks relating to growth as a standalone company, following which the Oak Street Health Board instructed Mr. Pykosz to inform\nMs. Lynch that the Oak Street Health Board was prepared to proceed with a transaction at $39.00 per share.\nLater on February 2, 2023, Mr. Pykosz contacted Ms. Lynch to deliver the message from the Oak Street Health Board.\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nOn February 3, 2023, Mr. Cowhey contacted Mr. Cook to provide an overview of CVS Health\u2019s proposed financing plans and expected sources and\nuses in connection with CVS Health\u2019s financial obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nAlso on February 3, 2023, representatives of Shearman sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Oak Street Health disclosure letter to\nrepresentatives of Kirkland.\nBetween February 3, 2023 and February 7, 2023, representatives of Kirkland, Shearman, Dechert and McDermott and members of Oak Street\nHealth\u2019s and CVS Health\u2019s respective management teams engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, the Voting\nAgreement, the Oak Street Health disclosure letter and the other transaction documents.\nOn February 4, 2023 and February 5, 2023, Mr. Pykosz and representatives of CVS Health engaged in high-level discussions regarding the retention\nof Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management following consummation of the transaction.\nOn February 6, 2023, the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting that CVS Health was close to an agreement to acquire Oak Street Health\nfor $39.00 per share.\nLater on February 6, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance.

The Oak Street Health Board discussed the price and other terms of the Merger Agreement and indicated its support for a transaction on\nthose terms and instructed Oak Street Health\u2019s senior management and its counsel to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement and other transaction\ndocuments.\nDuring the course of February 7, 2023, senior management of Oak Street Health and senior management of CVS Health had a number of\nconversations about the Advance Notice and the potential impact on Oak Street Health\u2019s business.\nOn February 7, 2023, the Oak Street Health Board held a special meeting by videoconference, with members of Oak Street Health\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Centerview and Kirkland also in attendance.

With respect to record holders of uncertificated shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock (other than any shares of Oak Street Health common stock that are held by Oak Street Health as treasury stock or owned by\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nCVS Pharmacy or any of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub)), upon the Payment Agent\u2019s receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d (or such other evidence as\nthe Payment Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such uncertificated shares will be entitled to receive in exchange an amount in cash equal to\nthe product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock represented by such holder\u2019s transferred\nuncertificated shares by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the transferred uncertificated shares will be cancelled.\nNo interest will be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or uncertificated share. Until so surrendered or transferred,\noutstanding Certificates and uncertificated shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration payable in respect thereof. \nYou should not send in your Certificates until you receive a letter of transmittal with instructions from the Payment Agent. Do not send your\nCertificates with your proxy card.\nAt or prior to the closing, CVS Pharmacy will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with Oak Street Health, by wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds, the aggregate vested equity award consideration owed to the Cash-Out Equity Award Holders. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any\nevent no later than ten business days after the closing date, the Cash-Out Equity Award Holders will be paid by Oak Street Health or the surviving\ncorporation, through its payroll system, payroll provider or Oak Street Health\u2019s standard accounts payable procedures, as applicable, all amounts\nrequired to be paid to such Cash-Out Equity Award Holders in respect of vested Options and RSUs that are cancelled and converted into a cash\npayment, less any required withholding and other authorized deductions.\nOak Street Health will take such actions as is necessary to effect the treatment of unvested Options, RSAs, and RSUs and to effectuate the\ntreatment of the Oak Street Health ESPP upon the Effective Time and otherwise to give effect to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nEach of the surviving corporation, Merger Sub, CVS Pharmacy and the Payment Agent (each, a \u201cWithholding Agent\u201d) will be entitled to deduct\nand withhold from any amounts payable to any person pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld\nunder applicable law with respect to taxes\u037e provided, that each such Withholding Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the recipient\nof such payment a reasonable opportunity to provide tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable) in order to reduce\nor eliminate such withholding\u037e provided, however, that no notice will be required for any deduction or withholding that is required for any Cash-Out\nEquity Award Holders. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated for all purposes as having\nbeen paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.",

All references in this summary to (i) a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record\nholder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock, (ii) a \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Oak Street Health\ncommon stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) a \u201cperson\u201d are to an individual, corporation, partnership,\nunincorporated association or other entity. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1) properly\nsubmit a written demand for an appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock to Oak Street Health prior to the stockholder vote on the\nMerger Proposal\u037e (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the Merger Proposal\u037e (3) hold shares of Oak Street Health common stock upon the\nmaking of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold their shares of Oak Street Health common stock through the effective date of the Merger\u037e (4)\nnot thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case,\nin accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (5) otherwise meet the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares in accordance with the procedures\nof subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the\neffective date of the Merger and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262\nof the DGCL, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is\naccompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a\ntrue and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Oak Street\nHealth under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the Verified List (defined below). The shares of Oak Street Health common stock are currently\nlisted on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which\nwe expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Oak Street\nHealth stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock entitled to\nappraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value of the aggregate\nconsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as\nthe \u201cMinimum Conditions.\u201d\n \n103Table of Contents\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including\nany surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e\nprovided, however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation may\npay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount\nthat equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair\nvalue of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less\nthan the Merger Consideration.  \nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the corporation\u2019s stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of\nsuch meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section\n262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed\nwithout subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full\ntext of Section 262 of the DGCL is accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who\nwishes to preserve such person\u2019s right to do so should review the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL carefully. Failure to comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses\nhis, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for\nexercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. \nStockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock must\nstrictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner or the surviving corporation must file a petition in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nBecause receipt of a signed proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, a\nstockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the Merger\nProposal, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding methods of\nvoting.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Oak Street Health, before the vote on the Merger Proposal\nat the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from\nvoting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262\nof the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder\u2019s or\nbeneficial owner\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will constitute a\nwaiver of appraisal rights.\n \n104\nTable of Contents\nRecord Holders\nA demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the identity\nof the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If a holder of\nrecord is submitting a demand with respect to shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one\nperson, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including\nan authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify\nthe record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of\nrecord, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Oak Street Health common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or\nmore beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of Oak Street Health common stock held for one or more beneficial owners\nwhile not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Oak Street Health\ncommon stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Oak Street Health common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will\nbe presumed to cover all shares of Oak Street Health common stock held in the name of the holder of record.\nBeneficial Owners\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares in accordance with the procedures\nof subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the\neffective date of the Merger and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262\nof the DGCL, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is\naccompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a\ntrue and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Oak Street\nHealth under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the Verified List (defined below).\nAlthough not expressly required by Section 262 of the DGCL, Oak Street Health reserves the right to take the position that it may require the\nsubmission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any person sharing\nbeneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:\nOak Street Health, Inc.\n30 W. Monroe St, Suite 1200, Chicago, IL 60603\nAttention: Chief Legal Officer and Secretary\nDemands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic transmission.\nActions After Completion of the Merger\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten days after the effective date of the Merger, the surviving corporation will notify each Oak Street Health\nstockholder who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal,\nand any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal, of the effective date of the Merger. At any time within 60 days after the effective date of\nthe Merger, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal\n \n105\nTable of Contents\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration offered\npursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Oak Street Health a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the effective\ndate of the Merger, the surviving corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 of the DGCL, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the\nsurviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the fair value of the\nshares held by all of Oak Street Health stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention,\nto file a petition, and no person should assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value\nof the shares of Oak Street Health common stock. Accordingly, any Oak Street Health stockholder or beneficial owner who desire to have their shares of\nOak Street Health common stock appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares\nof Oak Street Health common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL could result in the loss of appraisal\nrights.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be\nentitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of\nthe Merger Proposal and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners\nholding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares\nshall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The surviving corporation must give this\nstatement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after\nthe expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is\nserved upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware\nRegister in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded\nappraisal for their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of Oak Street Health common\nstock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for\nthe hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated therein.\nThe forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices shall be borne\nby the surviving corporation.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to\ndetermine those persons who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock to submit their stock certificates\nto the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that\ndirection, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nIn addition, assuming Oak Street Health common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all Oak Street Health stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the\nMinimum Conditions is met.\n \n106\nTable of Contents\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments\nmade by the surviving corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest\naccrues as described above).\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered,\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends,\nearnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future\nprospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\nprospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they\ndid not seek appraisal of their shares of Oak Street Health common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal\nof fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights should recognize that such an\nappraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration.\nNeither Oak Street Health nor CVS Pharmacy anticipates offering more than the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any\nholder of shares of Oak Street Health common stock exercising appraisal rights, and Oak Street Health and CVS Pharmacy each reserve the right to make a\nvoluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section\n262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Oak Street Health common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a demand for appraisal is duly\nwithdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or other requirements imposed by Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect and seek appraisal are not\nsatisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name\nappears on the Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 of the DGCL.\n \n107\nTable of Contents\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to\nthe persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of\na person whose name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL\nor subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the absence of such an order,\neach party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Oak Street Health common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or\nloses or successfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of Oak Street Health common stock will be deemed to have been\nconverted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or\nwithdraw, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger or if the person delivers\nto the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person\u2019s shares of Oak Street\nHealth common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares,\nexcept dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if\nthe person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of\nsome or all of such person\u2019s shares within 60 days after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or, with respect to Oak Street\nHealth stockholders, if neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the Oak Street Health common stock remained listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately prior to the Effective Time), then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares shall cease. Once a petition for appraisal is\nfiled with the Delaware Court of Chancery, no appraisal proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of\nChancery and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a\nreservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e provided that\nthis sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Oak Street Health stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to\nconsult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n \n108\nTable of Contents",

In addition to the right to indemnification conferred herein, an indemnitee shall also have the right, to\nthe fullest extent not prohibited by law, to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in\nadvance of its final disposition (an \u201cadvance of expenses\u201d)\u037e provided, however, that if and to the extent that the DGCL requires, an\nadvance of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an \u201cundertaking\u201d), by or on behalf of\nsuch indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no\nfurther right to appeal (a \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this\nSection 10 or otherwise.

If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in\nfull pursuant to such request is not made within forty-five days (or, in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days, provided that\nthe indemnitee has delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section 10(a) if required), the right to indemnification or advances as\ngranted by this Section 10 shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Monroe Street, Suite 1200\nChicago, Illinois 60603\nThe Board of Directors:\nYou have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per\nshare (the \u201cShares\u201d) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Oak Street Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), of $39.00 per\nShare in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered into and\ndated as of February 7, 2023 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), by and among CVS Pharmacy, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (\u201cParent\u201d), Halo Merger Sub Corp., a\nDelaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), the Company and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein,\nCVS Health Corporation, a Delaware corporation and ultimate parent company of Parent (\u201cCVS\u201d). The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be\nmerged with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the \u201cTransaction\u201d), as a\nresult of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective\ntime of the Merger (other than (i) each Share that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock or (B) owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries\n(including Merger Sub), in each case as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (ii) Shares subject to outstanding awards of Company\nRestricted Stock (as defined in the Agreement) and (iii) Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (the Shares referred to in clauses (i),\nand (ii) and (iii), together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d)) will be converted into the right to receive\n$39.00 per Share in cash, without interest (the $39.00 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the \u201cConsideration\u201d). The terms and conditions of\nthe Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our\nservices in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is\ncontingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us\nagainst certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.\nWe are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and\nmerchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current engagement in respect of the Transaction, we have not been engaged to provide\nfinancial advisory or other services to the Company, and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. We are currently\nengaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic Service Company, LP (\u201cGeneral\nAtlantic\u201d) (affiliates of which own approximately 25% of the Shares), and we may receive compensation from such company in the future. In 2022, our\nrestructuring team was engaged to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to a portfolio company of General Atlantic in\nconnection with certain restructuring-related matters, and we received compensation from such company. In 2021, we were engaged to provide financial\nadvisory services to Landmark Health, LLC (\u201cLandmark Health\u201d) in connection with its sale to UnitedHealth Group, at which time General Atlantic was\nthe majority owner of Landmark Health, and we received compensation from Landmark Health forTable of Contents\nsuch services. In the past two years, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent or CVS, Parent\u2019s ultimate parent\nentity, and we have not received any compensation from Parent or CVS during such period.
