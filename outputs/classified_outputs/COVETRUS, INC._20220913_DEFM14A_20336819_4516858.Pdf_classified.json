The Board, by a unanimous vote of the Company\u2019s directors (other than the Recused Directors), recommends a vote (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Agreement Proposal, (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the material factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions, see the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons\nfor the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 32. In addition, in considering the recommendation of\nthe Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different\nfrom, or in addition to, the interests of Covetrus stockholders generally. See the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 68.\nQ:\nHow will CD&R vote the shares of Company common stock it holds?\nA:\nPursuant to the Support and Rollover Agreement, CD&R VFC Holdings, which owns approximately 24.03% of the issued and outstanding shares of\nCompany common stock, agreed to vote or cause to be voted any shares of Company common stock owned by it in favor of the Merger and the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or necessary or desirable in furtherance of\nthe Transactions, including the Merger, and the adjournment of any meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders in accordance with the Merger\nAgreement and against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the\nMerger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cSupport and Rollover Agreement.\u201d\nQ:\nDo I need to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nNo. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date,\nyou may vote by mail, by telephone or through the internet, as described in more detail below. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares, you must\nfollow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee for your shares of Company common stock to be voted\nat the special meeting, as described in more detail below.\nQ:\nHow many shares of Company common stock need to be represented at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the\nshares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the meeting constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 7, 2022, there were 140,122,753 shares of Company common stock outstanding. If you are a Covetrus stockholder as of the close\nof business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the internet or at the special meeting via the virtual meeting website,\nyou will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of Company common stock and you provide your bank,\nbroker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a\n\u201cstreet name\u201d holder of shares of Company common stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting\ninstructions, then your shares will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.\nAll shares of Company common stock held by stockholders that attend the special meeting via the virtual meeting website, or are represented by\nproxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their\nproxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special\nmeeting may be adjourned.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nCovetrus\u2019 named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?\nA:\nIn July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid\nor become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In\naccordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Covetrus is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast\na non-binding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Covetrus\u2019 named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cProposal 2: Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,\u201d beginning on page 125.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Covetrus stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nThe vote to approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nApproval of the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning\nthat it will not be binding on Covetrus or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by\nCovetrus\u2019 stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our\nnamed executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How many votes do I have?\nA:\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this proxy statement, please\nvote your shares of Company common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each\nshare of Company common stock that you owned on September 7, 2022, the record date.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?\nA:\nYou may vote by:\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the enclosed prepaid\nenvelope\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting your proxy through the internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive\u037e or\n17\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ncasting your vote at www.proxypush.com/CVET. Any stockholder can virtually attend the special meeting by visiting\nwww.proxydocs.com/CVET and registering before the start of the special meeting. Upon completing your registration, you will receive\nfurther instructions via email, including your unique links that will allow you access to the virtual meeting, where you will be able to listen to\nthe meeting live, submit questions and vote online. The special meeting starts at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. We encourage you to allow ample\ntime for online check-in, which will open at 9:45 a.m., Eastern Time. Instructions on who can attend and participate via internet, including\nhow to demonstrate proof of stock ownership, are posted at proxydocs.com/CVET.\nSubmitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet will not prevent you from casting your vote at the special meeting via the\nvirtual meeting website. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the internet even if you plan to attend the special\nmeeting via the virtual meeting website to ensure that your shares of Company common stock are represented at the special meeting.\nIf you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger\nAgreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat is the deadline for voting my shares of Company common stock?\nA:\nIf you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on\nOctober 10, 2022.\nIf your shares of Company common stock were purchased through the ESPP and are held through your account with Continental Stock Transfer &\nTrust Company, you must vote such shares by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 10, 2022.\nIf you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card must be completed, signed, dated and returned in the enclosed\npostage-paid reply envelope or otherwise filed with our Corporate Secretary no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 10, 2022. You may also\nattend the special meeting virtually. If you are a beneficial owner, please review the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other\nnominee for information on the deadline for voting your shares.\nQ:\nIf my shares are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee vote those shares for me\nwith respect to the proposals?\nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Company common stock at the special meeting unless\nyou provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee\non how to vote your shares with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be\nable to vote by telephone or through the internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.\nQ:\nWhat if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?\nA:\nYour bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Company common stock unless you have properly instructed\nyour bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, the failure to provide your nominee with voting\ninstructions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal. Furthermore, your shares of Company common stock\nwill not be included in the calculation of the number of shares present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is\npresent.\n18\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the internet?\nA:\nYes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering\na signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy delivered to Margaret\nPritchard, Secretary, Covetrus, Inc., 7 Custom House Street, Portland, Maine 04101. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by\nsubmitting another proxy by telephone or through the internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit\na later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should\nretain a copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by\ntelephone or through the internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special meeting via the virtual meeting\nwebsite and voting at the meeting. However, simply attending the special meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. \u201cStreet\nname\u201d holders of shares of Company common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to\nrevoke or change their proxies.\nIf you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Company common stock, you must follow the instructions\nreceived from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.\nAll properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the special\nmeeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,\n\u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?\nA:\nIf you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Company common stock that are registered in more than one account. For\nexample, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you\nwill receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record\nownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted, you will need to submit your proxies by mailing in\neach proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the internet by using the different voter control number(s) on each proxy card.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,\nunless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,\neach stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation and reduces printing and mailing expenses. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of Company common stock, you may\nhave already received a householding notification. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cHouseholding of Proxy Material,\u201d\nbeginning on page 144.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Company common stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the Merger. If you own shares of Company common stock\nas of the close of business on the record date but transfer your shares prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special\nmeeting, but the right to receive the Merger Consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, holders\nof record of shares of Company common stock who have perfected\n19\nTable of Contents\nand not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of\ntheir shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be available to these holders if\nthey deliver a written demand for an appraisal to Covetrus prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the special meeting and they\ncomply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal\namount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled\n\u201cAppraisal Rights,\u201d beginning on page 127.\nQ:\nIf I hold my shares of Company common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written instructions on how to return your\nstock certificates. You must return your stock certificates in accordance with such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration.\nPLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.\nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nWe and Parent are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during\nthe second half of 2022, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The\nMerger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by Covetrus stockholders. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Merger,\u201d\nbeginning on page 107.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to\nvote on such matter, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for\nyour shares of Company common stock. Instead, Covetrus will remain a public company, and Company common stock will continue to be registered\nunder the Exchange Act and listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in\nwhich it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Company common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and\nopportunities to which they are currently subject with respect to their ownership of Company common stock.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Covetrus is required to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$88,315,000. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent may be required to pay Covetrus a termination fee of $197,950,000 if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated due to certain reasons related to Parent\u2019s breach or failure to close. For additional information, see the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees,\u201d beginning on page 110.\nFor additional information, see the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,\u201d beginning on page 74.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nThe Company will publish final voting results from the special meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the\nspecial meeting. For more information, please see the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\n20\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nAre there any requirements if I plan on attending the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will be held via live webcast only.

        "Section Text": "Overview\nCovetrus is seeking the adoption by its stockholders of the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or\nwaiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Covetrus. Covetrus will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nThe Transaction Committee has approved and recommended to the Board the Merger Agreement Proposal, and the Board has approved the Merger\nAgreement and unanimously recommends that Covetrus stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time\n(other than shares of Company common stock (i) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries (including the shares of\nCompany common stock transferred by CD&R VFC Holdings, directly or indirectly, to Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) owned by\nCovetrus as treasury stock and (iii) owned by Covetrus stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance\nwith Section 262 of the DGCL), will be converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash, without interest thereon.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, Covetrus will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nBackground of the Merger\nThe Board, together with the Company\u2019s management, regularly reviews and discusses the Company\u2019s performance, risks, strategy and opportunities, as\nwell as its competitive environment and trends. As part of this periodic review and assessment, from time to time, the Board and the Company\u2019s\nmanagement consider potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and may receive inquiries from third parties\nseeking to determine the Company\u2019s interest in a sale transaction in whole or in part.\nCD&R VFC Holdings became the beneficial owner of approximately 10.1% of the outstanding shares of the Company common stock as a result of the\nFebruary 2019 transaction between Henry Schein and Direct Vet Marketing, Inc., which created the Company and resulted in CD&R\u2019s investment in Direct\nVet Marketing, Inc. being exchanged for common stock in the Company. In connection with the closing of the 2019 transaction, Ravi Sachdev, a CD&R\npartner, became a director of the Company.\nIn an effort to strengthen the Company\u2019s liquidity position and balance sheet, the Company, with the assistance of financial advisors Ardea Partners LP\nand Goldman Sachs, in early 2020 reached out to parties it believed could potentially be interested in a preferred equity investment in the Company.\nFollowing negotiations between the Company and several parties, on April 30, 2020, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the \u201cInvestment\nAgreement\u201d) with CD&R VFC Holdings pursuant to which CD&R VFC Holdings agreed to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Convertible Series\nA Preferred Stock (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). In May 2020, as a result of the closing of the Private Placement, CD&R VFC Holdings\u2019 shareholding\nincreased to the equivalent of approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock on an as-converted basis. In connection with the\nPrivate Placement and pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Board increased in size to elect an additional director, to be nominated by CD&R VFC\nHoldings and mutually agreed by the Company and CD&R VFC Holdings. Shortly after the closing of the Private Placement, CD&R partner Sandra\nPeterson became a director of the Company. Effective November 18, 2020, all of CD&R VFC Holdings\u2019 shares of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock had\nbeen converted into shares of Company common stock pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation, resulting in CD&R VFC Holdings owning\n33,670,541 shares of Company common stock.\nThe Investment Agreement includes a standstill provision (the \u201cStandstill Agreement\u201d) that, among other things, prohibits CD&R and its affiliates from\nincreasing their ownership stake in the Company or making an\n22Table of Contents\nacquisition proposal of any kind to the Company without prior Board approval. From time to time, CD&R has considered alternatives for its investment in\nthe Company, including the possibility of selling the Company common stock held by CD&R VFC Holdings or participating in some other form of\ntransaction involving the Company. In August 2021, following the receipt by the Company of unsolicited inquiries from a few financial sponsors\nregarding the potential sale of the Company, Mr. Sachdev discussed with Benjamin Wolin, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, CD&R\u2019s\npossible interest in having the Board explore potential strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including the acquisition of all of the\noutstanding shares of Company common stock by a third-party buyer or potentially by CD&R, although no proposal regarding an acquisition of\nadditional shares of Company common stock was made by Mr. Sachdev. Mr. Wolin discussed with Philip Laskawy, Chairman of the Board, his discussion\nwith Mr. Sachdev, and thereafter, Mr. Sachdev discussed CD&R\u2019s perspectives on the receipt by the Company of unsolicited inquiries from financial\nsponsors, at a meeting of the Board held on September 20, 2021. Following discussions with the Board in September 2021, representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s management contacted Goldman Sachs and Lincoln International (\u201cLincoln\u201d, together with Goldman Sachs, the \u201cFinancial Advisors\u201d), based\nupon their respective reputations, qualifications, experience in mergers and acquisitions, financial analyses, financing and capital markets and familiarity\nwith the Company and the industry in which the Company operates, to assist the Company in developing a preliminary view with respect to the\nCompany\u2019s valuation, the market generally and potential strategic alternatives, if any, that may be available to the Company.\nAt a meeting on September 23, 2021, the Board (other than the Recused Directors) reviewed with representatives of its legal advisor and Lincoln, the fact\nthat the Company had received certain unsolicited indications of interest, and potential benefits and considerations in connection with pursuing any\nsuch indications, including the risk of a leak. The representatives of Lincoln discussed with the Board considerations regarding process and timing with\nrespect to a review of potential strategic alternatives, as well as an initial list of potential counterparties that might have interest and capacity to engage in\nsuch a transaction. Following discussion regarding potential strategic alternatives, including continuing to execute on the Company\u2019s plan on a\nstandalone basis and the potential benefits of each alternative, the Board determined it would continue to review additional information to be prepared by\nmanagement and its financial advisors at its next meeting.\nAt a meeting on September 30, 2021, the Board reviewed, together with its legal advisor and Goldman Sachs, the Company\u2019s financial analyses, the market\ngenerally and potential strategic alternatives, if any, that may be available to the Company, including the possibility of exploring a transaction with a third-\nparty buyer or potentially with CD&R. The Recused Directors (Ms. Peterson and Mr. Sachdev) recused themselves from participation in the Board\u2019s\ndiscussion given the possibility that, if the Board were to explore a sale of the Company, CD&R could be among the parties that could be interested in\nparticipating in such a transaction. For that reason, references to the Board in this section of this proxy statement, unless otherwise specified, are to the\nBoard without the participation of the Recused Directors. The Board discussed whether to engage with the parties that had expressed an interest in\npursuing a transaction and, if so, whether to approach additional potential counterparties. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company\nshould not solicit indications of interest from potential acquirors at such time and should inform CD&R that the Company was not for sale, but that\nCD&R could receive limited due diligence materials, pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality provisions in the Investment Agreement, in order to\npermit CD&R to further develop its views regarding the Company. Following the Board meeting, Messrs. Laskawy and Wolin informed Mr. Sachdev of\nthe Board\u2019s determination.\nAt a meeting on October 25, 2021, the Board again met with representatives of Goldman Sachs to further discuss Goldman Sachs\u2019s preliminary\npresentation to the Board in September, including in respect of market and industry conditions and their preliminary perspectives on financial analyses.\nMr. Wolin discussed with the Board the fact that CD&R had, during the course of the prior weeks, asked certain follow-up questions related to due\ndiligence matters, which the Company answered, but that the Company had not yet received any proposal from CD&R.\nIn late October 2021, Mr. Sachdev communicated to Mr. Wolin that he and Ms. Peterson would like the opportunity to speak with the other members of\nthe Board regarding their perspectives on the Company. At a\n23\nTable of Contents\nregularly scheduled Board meeting on November 4, 2021, the Board discussed Mr. Sachdev\u2019s request of Mr. Wolin. After discussion, the Board requested\nthat Mr. Wolin coordinate with Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson a time for them to share their perspectives on the Company.\nAt a Board meeting on November 24, 2021, which Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson attended, Mr. Sachdev discussed with the Board CD&R\u2019s perspectives\non the Company\u2019s business, including with respect to competition and potential growth strategies for the Company. In addition, Mr. Sachdev indicated\nthat CD&R continued to consider alternatives for its investment in the Company, including the possibility of selling the Company common stock held by\nCD&R VFC Holdings, depending on price and terms, as well as acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Company common stock not then owned by\nCD&R VFC Holdings. Mr. Sachdev confirmed to the Board that CD&R did not have a proposal to make to the Company at that time and, prior to the\nmaking of any such proposal, the Board would need to waive the Standstill Agreement. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson\ndeparted the meeting, and the rest of the Board continued its discussion regarding the conversation with Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson, including in\nconnection with Mr. Sachdev\u2019s indication that CD&R may be supportive of transactions involving the sale of all outstanding shares of Company\ncommon stock, including shares of Company common stock then owned by CD&R VFC Holdings, to a third party, as well as a transaction involving the\nsale of all outstanding shares of Company common stock other than those then owned by CD&R VFC Holdings, in each case, depending upon price and\nterms.\nAt a meeting on December 3, 2021 with members of management and representatives of the Company\u2019s legal advisor and Goldman Sachs participating,\nthe Board discussed with management, among other things, the Company\u2019s long-range business plan and potential challenges that might impact the\nCompany\u2019s execution of its business plan and the Company\u2019s business generally, including customer consolidation, suppliers \u201cgoing direct\u201d, increased\nmarket competition, the performance of the Company\u2019s compounding business and certain strategic business initiatives. Management also discussed\nwith the Board certain potential opportunities with respect to the Company\u2019s business, including the ability to leverage data to stabilize supplier\neconomics and market share capture opportunities for generics and proprietary branded products. The Board then continued its discussions with\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs regarding the Company\u2019s business and the market and a range of potential strategic alternatives for\nthe Company, including continuing to execute on the Company\u2019s strategic plan, divestiture of non-core assets, return of capital to stockholders (either\nthrough a sale of the whole Company or a sale of its parts), as well as a potential timeline for a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of\nthe Company, and the identity of potential parties who might be interested in a transaction involving the Company and capable of acquiring the\nCompany.\nFollowing the December 3, 2021 Board meeting, Mr. Sachdev indicated to Mr. Wolin and Mr. Laskawy that, if the Board were to consider exploring a sale\nof the Company, CD&R\u2019s preliminary view on the value of the Company at that time was in the range of $24.00 per share (which represented an\napproximately 43% premium to the closing price of $16.79 of the Company common stock on December 3, 2021). Mr. Wolin relayed this communication to\nother members of the Board and, as a result, the Board established the Transaction Committee, comprising Mr. Laskawy, Mark Manoff and Sharon\nWienbar, each of whom is an independent member of the Board, unaffiliated with CD&R, to, among other things, review and evaluate strategic\nalternatives that might be available to the Company.\nOn December 9, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and the\nCompany\u2019s legal advisors, at which, among other things, the Board received an update from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the recent performance\nof the Company\u2019s stock price and preliminary financial analyses considerations, and continued their discussion from prior meetings regarding various\nstrategic alternatives, as well as process and timing considerations with respect to such alternatives, including a divestiture of the Company\u2019s\ninternational distribution business, a sale of the Company and an investment in certain areas of the Company\u2019s business. The Board also discussed with\nmanagement and its advisors the preliminary view on the value of the Company that had been communicated by CD&R to\n24\nTable of Contents\nMr. Laskawy and Mr. Wolin. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders to initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. Therefore, the Board directed the Company\u2019s\nmanagement to formally retain Goldman Sachs and Lincoln as the Company\u2019s financial advisors (subject to negotiating an acceptable engagement letter\nwith each), in each case, based upon their respective reputations, qualifications, experience in mergers and acquisitions, financial analyses, financing and\ncapital markets and their familiarity with the Company. As part of this process, the Board authorized and directed the Financial Advisors to contact\nparties that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company, with the Transaction Committee providing guidance, oversight and\nsupport in connection with this process. During that period, Mr. Wolin, Mr. Laskawy and Mr. Sachdev further discussed CD&R\u2019s preliminary view on the\nvalue of the Company communicated on December 3, 2021.\nOn December 23, 2021, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisors and legal advisors, as well as\nmanagement to discuss, among other things, process and timing considerations with respect to strategic alternatives that might be available to the\nCompany, including a potential sale of the Company. Representatives of the Financial Advisors provided the Transaction Committee with an overview of\na sale process, including an overview of the workstreams associated with the sale process, as well as a list of potential parties who might be interested\nand capable of engaging in a transaction involving the Company. The members of the Transaction Committee discussed and considered the likely timing\nof such a sale process. During the course of the discussion, Mr. Wolin informed the Transaction Committee that he had received an unsolicited indication\nof interest from a party with respect to the potential acquisition of the Company\u2019s SmartPak business, and the Transaction Committee discussed with\nmanagement and its advisors the impact of a sale of the SmartPak business on the Company, including the potential to dilute the Company\u2019s technology\nsegment financial performance. However, the Transaction Committee concluded that, if the third party proposed a compelling financial offer, the\nTransaction Committee and the Board would entertain such a proposal. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee directed the Financial Advisors\nto finalize the proposed list of potential parties, as well as work with management regarding the outreach script and the preparation of an initial data room.\nIn December 2021 and January 2022, the Company, with the assistance of the Financial Advisors, prepared materials for a potential sale process, including\na management presentation, supplemental financial information, and a financial model, in advance of initial outreach to potential interested parties. The\nCompany and the Financial Advisors also prepared a list of potential strategic companies and financial sponsors who might be interested in and capable\nof executing a transaction with the Company, for discussion with and approval by the Board.\nBetween January 3, 2022 and February 11, 2022, the Transaction Committee held several meetings with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of\nthe Financial Advisors and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, its legal advisor (\u201cWeil\u201d), to discuss the process to review strategic alternatives, including a\npotential sale, during which Goldman Sachs provided updates on the process, including the level of interest initially expressed by potential parties.\nDuring this time, the Company\u2019s Financial Advisors and Weil also discussed with CD&R the role that CD&R would play in the sale process, and CD&R\nagreed that it would not participate formally in the process at that time but would be willing to speak with potentially interested parties if requested to do\nso by, and subject to the prior approval of, the Transaction Committee.\nDuring January 2022, representatives of the Financial Advisors, at the direction and on behalf of the Company, conducted a broad outreach to potential\nparties, which together with inbound contacts, resulted in the Financial Advisors engaging with 24 parties, five of which were strategic companies\n(including Company A (as defined below) but contact with Company A began in February, as described below)) and nineteen of which were financial\nsponsors (not including CD&R, but including each of the financial sponsors who made unsolicited inquiries in August 2021), regarding a potential\nstrategic transaction with the Company. Of the 24 parties, the Company signed confidentiality agreements with 17 parties (including TPG, which entered\ninto a confidentiality\n25\nTable of Contents\nagreement with the Company on February 7, 2022), and each confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision. Other parties that the\nFinancial Advisors contacted declined to participate in the process for a variety of reasons, including the complexity of the business, concerns regarding\npotential challenges facing the distribution business and the impact of consolidation. Each party that signed a confidentiality agreement was provided\naccess to certain non-public materials regarding the Company\u2019s business and operations and a call with members of the Company\u2019s management team. Of\nthe 17 parties, four declined to participate further in the process for various reasons including other business priorities and the size of the investment\nrequired by the potential transaction. On February 15, 2022, the Transaction Committee and the Company\u2019s advisors relayed to the Board an overall\nsummary update of the process.\nOn February 9, 2022 and February 16, 2022, the Company entered into engagement letters with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, respectively, formalizing the\nengagement of the Financial Advisors to act as the Company\u2019s co-financial advisors to, among other things, assist the Company in evaluating strategic\nalternatives for the Company, including a potential sale of the Company.\nDuring February and early March 2022, members of the Company\u2019s management team held management presentations and Q&A sessions (with two\nstrategic companies and 15 financial sponsors, including TPG) and subsequent diligence sessions at certain of which representatives of the Financial\nAdvisors participated, as did advisors of the strategic companies and financial sponsors. Management did not conduct a management presentation with\nCD&R, but did hold a Q&A session at which CD&R received an update on current performance trends.\nOn February 18, 2022, at the direction of the Company, representatives of the Financial Advisors delivered a process letter to the 12 remaining parties\n(comprising two strategic companies and 10 financial sponsors, including TPG but not including CD&R) that had signed confidentiality agreements and\nparticipated in management meetings with the Company requesting that each party submit a non-binding written proposal with respect to a strategic\ntransaction with the Company by no later than March 9, 2022. On February 24, 2022, representatives of the Financial Advisors sent an additional process\nletter to one financial sponsor who executed a confidentiality agreement after the February 18, 2022 distribution.\nDuring the course of February 2022, a representative of a strategic party (\u201cCompany A\u201d), which has a commercial relationship with the Company,\ncontacted Mr. Sachdev regarding pursuing a potential transaction involving the Company, as a result of hearing that the Company may be exploring\nstrategic alternatives. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev informed Mr. Wolin of the contact, and they briefly discussed how Company A\u2019s interest\ncould potentially impact the Company\u2019s general strategic plans, irrespective of whether a transaction with Company A or any other party was ultimately\npursued. Mr. Wolin thereafter informed Mr. Laskawy of the discussion with Mr. Sachdev, and Messrs. Wolin and Laskawy discussed the possibility of a\ntransaction with Company A and the considerations that could arise given Company A\u2019s existing commercial relationship with the Company. Following\nthat discussion, Mr. Wolin had several discussions with representatives of Company A, and Company A was invited to participate in the Company\u2019s\nprocess to review strategic alternatives.\nOn March 9, 2022, the deadline for submitting indications of interest in connection with the sale process, TPG submitted a non-binding written proposal\nto acquire all of the shares of Company common stock for a purchase price in the range of $21.00 to $22.00 per share in cash, subject to TPG\u2019s completion\nof its due diligence. TPG was the only party that submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire all of the shares of Company common stock by the\ndeadline reflected in the process letter.\nOn March 15, 2022, a representative of Company A called a representative of Goldman Sachs to indicate that an offer for the acquisition of the Company\u2019s\nglobal technology business (the \u201cGTS Business\u201d) for cash consideration in an enterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion would be\nforthcoming.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOn March 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of the Financial Advisors and\nWeil, as well as Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson who attended a portion of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting Mr. Sachdev shared CD&R\u2019s\nperspective on the Company\u2019s business. Following that discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson departed the meeting, and the Board received an\nupdate on the status of the sale process, including the outreach and due diligence that had occurred to date. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman\nSachs reviewed with the Board a summary of the outreach efforts and feedback received from parties who had declined to move forward. The\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed with the Board changes in the market that had occurred since the previous Board meeting, including an\napproximate 10% decline in the equity markets since December 2021, significant volatility in the equity markets in 2022, increases in interest rates,\ngeopolitical tension and the fact that equity market valuations were depressed relative to recent historical valuations, with the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA\nmultiple being down 1.6x since December 7, 2021, and also discussed with the Board the Company\u2019s stock price performance over the same period.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed with the Board that Company A indicated a proposal for the acquisition of the GTS Business in an\nenterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion was forthcoming. Goldman Sachs further discussed with the Board and management that\nCompany A had been highly engaged and had indicated that it was interested in exploring a potential transaction. The Board, management and the\nadvisors discussed key considerations with respect to the process, including timing, engagement of the potential buyers, strategies for creating\ncompetitive tension to try and drive the most successful outcome, whether there were other parties (in particular financial sponsors) who might be\ninterested in acquiring the Company\u2019s distribution business that could be partnered with Company A to facilitate a transaction involving the entire\ncompany, the risks of not reaching a successful outcome of the sale process, the possibility of separating the distribution and technology businesses,\nand considerations of the alternatives currently available. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of\nthe Company and its stockholders to continue with the sale process and directed Goldman Sachs to both identify financial sponsors who might be\ninterested in partnering with Company A, and to work with Company A to try and improve its valuation in order to provide a compelling price for the GTS\nBusiness. Later that day, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of management, the Financial Advisors and Weil to discuss next steps with\nrespect to Company A, and strategies to maximize the value for the Company and the stockholders related to a transaction with Company A.\nFollowing the Board meeting on March 17, 2022, Company A sent a non-binding written proposal for the acquisition of the GTS Business for cash\nconsideration in an enterprise value range of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, or approximately 18x to 21x their 2022 projected pro forma adjusted\nEBITDA for the GTS Business. Representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Company A and provided the feedback from the Board\nmeeting.\nOn March 20, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted a representative of Goldman Sachs and provided an updated verbal indication of interest to\nacquire the GTS Business for cash consideration in the range of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, subject to confirmatory due diligence, which increased offer\nreflected revised assumptions regarding corporate allocations, the exclusion of a particular product line, to which a lower multiple had been assigned and\na willingness to increase the multiple they would ascribe to the GTS Business.\nOn March 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Weil to discuss, among other things, the Company A proposal from March 20, 2022. The Transaction Committee asked questions of\nmanagement and the advisors regarding Company A\u2019s proposal and the likelihood of finding a financial sponsor to partner with Company A. Following\ndiscussion, the Transaction Committee directed Goldman Sachs to prepare a preliminary analysis regarding what they thought Company A could pay for\nthe GTS Business, and requested that management and Goldman Sachs conduct an analysis with respect to a transaction with Company A that would\nleave behind a public company distribution business, and the considerations associated with such a transaction. The Transaction Committee also\nrequested that the advisors discuss with CD&R to understand CD&R\u2019s current views on valuation, given the changes in the stock market and the\neconomy generally.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOn April 4, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of the Financial\nAdvisors and Weil, as well as Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson as representatives of CD&R. The CD&R representatives had been invited to attend the\nmeeting to share CD&R\u2019s current views on valuation. At the meeting, the representatives of CD&R communicated to the Transaction Committee that, if\ninvited to make a proposal by the Board and subject to the Board granting a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R would be prepared to consider\nexploring a potential transaction at a valuation in the range of $21.00 to $22.00 per share of Company common stock (which represented a 23% to 29%\npremium to the closing price of $17.01 of the Company common stock on April 1, 2022). Mr. Sachdev discussed with the Transaction Committee the\nreasons for the view on valuation, including the increased cost of capital, as well as challenges facing the Company, including with respect to\nconsolidation in its end-markets. Mr. Sachdev also informed the Transaction Committee that if CD&R were to move forward with exploring a possible\ntransaction, it would need to partner with another financial sponsor and that it was willing to explore a possible transaction with a number of financial\nsponsors, including TPG. The members of the Transaction Committee and representatives of CD&R then discussed certain other matters regarding a\npossible transaction, and following that discussion, the representatives of CD&R left the meeting.\nAfter the CD&R representatives left the meeting, the Transaction Committee discussed the Company A proposal and the possibility of exploring a\ntransaction within the range of values communicated by CD&R. The Transaction Committee also discussed potential responses and options to proceed\nwith the potential parties with management and the Company\u2019s advisors, as well as the Company\u2019s recent financial performance. The Transaction\nCommittee and Goldman Sachs also discussed the possibility that a particular financial sponsor who had declined to move forward in the broader sale\nprocess, but who might have an interest in acquiring the Company\u2019s distribution business, based on its investment history, might serve as a potential\npartner for Company A, so that a sale of the entire company could be accomplished. The Transaction Committee requested that Goldman Sachs connect\nwith the financial sponsor (\u201cFinancial Investor A\u201d) to ascertain its level of interest and to determine its willingness to partner with Company A, and\ndetermined that these matters would be discussed with the whole Board at the upcoming meeting and that it would be appropriate for the CD&R\nrepresentatives to be invited to that meeting to discuss CD&R\u2019s current views on valuation with the full Board. The Transaction Committee reconvened\nwith its advisors on April 6, 2022 to briefly discuss the updates the Board would receive the following day.\nOn April 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, as well\nas, for certain portions, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson as representatives of CD&R. During the meeting, the Board (including the Recused Directors)\nreceived an update from Mr. Wolin on the performance of the Company. In addition, the CD&R representatives discussed with the Board CD&R\u2019s current\nviews on valuation and the reasons for their revised valuation relative to what they had communicated in December, including increased interest rates,\nhigher financing costs and equity market deterioration. Following such discussion, Mr. Sachdev and Ms. Peterson departed the meeting.\nThe Board then discussed CD&R\u2019s revised views on valuation and the factors identified by the CD&R representatives for its revised views, as well as the\nCompany\u2019s recent financial performance, the Company\u2019s headwinds and tailwinds and the trends management was seeing both with respect to the\nCompany and companies in similar industries. The Board also discussed the proposal from Company A and the viability of a sale of just the GTS\nBusiness. The Board further discussed the interest of Financial Investor A and potential partnering between Financial Investor A and Company A, as\nwell as a partnering of CD&R and TPG, in each case, in order to achieve a sale of the entire Company. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs\nreviewed with the Board a financial overview of the valuation range communicated by CD&R and the proposal from Company A, and reviewed with the\nBoard the fact that they had approached another company to see whether it would be interested in a distribution-only transaction, but that that company\nhad declined. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue\nthe process of exploring a sale, and that it would be beneficial to that process to allow CD&R to partner with TPG and to try and facilitate a partnering of\nFinancial Investor A and Company A.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the Board meeting on April 7, 2022, a representative of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of CD&R and TPG that they could proceed\nwith discussions regarding potentially partnering together to make a proposal to acquire the Company. Additionally, on April 8, 2022, a representative of\nGoldman Sachs invited Financial Investor A into the sale process. On April 8, 2022, a representative of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of\nCD&R and TPG to communicate details on the process going forward.\nFollowing the communication from the representative of Goldman Sachs, CD&R and TPG began their joint due diligence efforts. At the invitation of the\nCompany, during April and May 2022, the Company\u2019s management team, advisors to the Company, CD&R, TPG and representatives and advisors of\nCD&R and TPG, including Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (\u201cDebevoise\u201d), legal counsel to CD&R and TPG, held several due diligence meetings on subject\nareas including finance, strategy, product and technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate\ngovernance, material contracts, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate, sanctions and compliance.\nOn April 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of the Company\u2019s management and Goldman Sachs to discuss the partnership of\nCompany A and Financial Investor A and directed the Financial Advisors and the Company\u2019s management to facilitate due diligence for both parties.\nLater that day, the Company\u2019s management, Goldman Sachs and Weil held a meeting with Financial Investor A and Company A to discuss due diligence\nand process going forward.\nOn April 15, 2022, Financial Investor A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company\u2019s\ndistribution business (nor an acquisition of the whole Company). As a result, Company A did not have a party with whom to partner to acquire the\nportions of the Company\u2019s business that were not included in Company A\u2019s GTS Business proposal.\nOn April 16, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss, among other things, the fact that Sponsor\nA had determined not to move forward with its evaluation of a potential transaction involving the Company and the implications that that determination\nhad with respect to a potential transaction with Company A. The Transaction Committee also discussed and considered with the advisors next steps with\nrespect to Company A, including whether there were other potential partners for Company A and negotiation strategies to obtain the maximum value for\nthe Company in connection with a transaction with Company A, particularly in light of relevant tax considerations. The Transaction Committee requested\nthat representatives of Goldman Sachs prepare materials to discuss with the Board at its upcoming meeting that include a calculation of illustrative net\nproceeds that would be recognized from a sale of the GTS Business, given the costs of separation and tax leakage identified by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, and indicative values resulting from financial analyses of the \u201cwhole company.\u201d\nOn April 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs made an initial draft of the Merger Agreement available in the virtual data room.\nAlso on April 20, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, at\nwhich, among other things, the Board received an update on the sale process, including the discussions with CD&R, TPG and Company A, as well as the\nupdate that Financial Investor A determined not to proceed with a potential acquisition of the Company\u2019s distribution business, and due diligence that\nhad occurred to date. The Board also received an overview from representatives of Goldman Sachs on the benefits and considerations of a sale of the\nwhole Company, a sale of just the GTS Business (leaving a distribution-only public company remaining thereafter, including the tax implications thereof)\nand continuing to execute on the Company\u2019s strategic plan on a standalone basis. The Board discussed with the representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nWeil the considerations and challenges of being a standalone distribution-only public company, including the likely valuation the public markets would\nascribe to such a business and the challenges of separating the Company\u2019s businesses in such a manner, the proceeds that would be received from the\nsale of the GTS Business and another product line in order to achieve the same valuation as a sale of the\n29\nTable of Contents\nwhole Company at various valuations (taking into account tax costs), and how that compared to the proposal from Company A, as well as the length of\ntime it could take to consummate such a transaction and the execution risk associated with such a transaction, including as a result of regulatory\napprovals. The Board also discussed with the representatives of Goldman Sachs whether there were other potential parties, including CD&R, that may be\ninterested in partnering with Company A. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to\ncontinue discussions with CD&R and TPG and with Company A regarding the possibility of a potential strategic transaction, and instructed the advisors\nto set a timeline for the remaining interested parties to make their proposals. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s discussion, later on April 20, 2022, a representative\nof the Company reached out to CD&R to discuss whether CD&R would be interested in exploring a possible transaction with Company A. As a result of\nthat discussion, representatives of CD&R and Company A briefly discussed the possibility of partnering in exploring a possible transaction, but\nfollowing such discussions decided to not pursue such a partnership.\nIn April 2022, the Company\u2019s management and representatives entered into discussions about a potential transaction with an additional potential\nstrategic party\u037e however, the party declined to enter into a confidentiality agreement and ultimately did not move forward in the process.\nOn May 16, 2022, representatives of CD&R and TPG spoke to a representative of Goldman Sachs, to communicate that, if invited by the Transaction\nCommittee and subject to obtaining a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R and TPG acting together would be prepared to consider further exploring\na possible transaction at a valuation of $20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock (which represented a 31% premium to the closing price of\n$15.27 of the Company common stock on May 13, 2022). The CD&R and TPG representatives indicated that the lower valuation was primarily due to\nvolatile financing markets with widened credit spreads, an improved understanding of the number of shares of Company common stock that were\noutstanding (resulting in an increased cost of acquisition) and a decrease in the Company\u2019s cash position forecasts. Later that day, the Transaction\nCommittee met with representatives of the Company\u2019s management, Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss the valuation communicated by CD&R and TPG,\nincluding the recent trends in the equity and debt markets (including in light of recent macroeconomic conditions), as well as illustrative premia for a\nrange of transaction values and proposed next steps with respect to negotiations with CD&R and TPG. The Transaction Committee determined it would\ndiscuss the matters the following day with the Board.\nOn May 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting, attended by members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Weil, at\nwhich the Board received an update on the sale process and due diligence that had occurred to date and an overview from representatives of Goldman\nSachs on the valuation communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022. The Board received an overview of the reasoning communicated for the\nproposed valuation being below TPG\u2019s value range submitted on March 9, 2022 and CD&R\u2019s value range communicated on April 4, 2022, and discussed\nthe fact that there was no partner for the portions of the Company\u2019s business that Company A would not acquire. After deliberations and discussions,\nincluding regarding the Company\u2019s recent financial performance and management\u2019s views regarding the strengths of and challenges facing the\nCompany\u2019s core businesses, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue discussions with\nCD&R and TPG to explore a possible transaction, but instructed the Transaction Committee and Goldman Sachs to inform CD&R and TPG that the\nvaluation communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022 did not reflect sufficient value for the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Board authorized the\nTransaction Committee to go back to CD&R and TPG and indicate that the Company would not be willing to further explore a transaction at the valuation\npreviously communicated by CD&R and TPG on May 16, 2022 and would need to receive a higher per share price in order to continue exploring a\npossible transaction.\nOn the evening of May 18, 2022, the Transaction Committee met with representatives of CD&R and TPG and conveyed the Board\u2019s message from the\nMay 17, 2022 meeting.\nOn May 19, 2022, Mr. Sachdev spoke with Mr. Laskawy to communicate that, if invited by the Transaction Committee to make a proposal and, subject to\nreceiving a waiver of the Standstill Agreement, CD&R and TPG\n30\nTable of Contents\nacting together would be prepared to consider exploring a possible transaction at a valuation of $20.50 in cash per share of Company common stock. Mr.\nLaskawy informed Mr. Sachdev that $20.50 per share did not represent sufficient value for the Company\u2019s stockholders. Later that day, Mr. Sachdev\nspoke with Mr. Laskawy again and communicated an updated valuation of $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock. Following the\ndiscussions on May 19, 2022, the Board convened with representatives of management, Goldman Sachs and Weil to discuss this communication.\nDuring the meeting, the Board discussed with management and its advisors the updated valuation from CD&R and TPG, the alternatives to the Company\nof doing a transaction, including the execution risk, as well as benefits, associated with implementation of its long-term business plan and the immediate\nvalue for the Company\u2019s stockholders that an all-cash transaction would provide. The Board also discussed with its advisors the fact that all parties that\nhad signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings with the Company, other than CD&R and TPG, had either declined to\nproceed with exploring a potential transaction with the Company for a variety of reasons or had been unable to submit an offer for the whole Company.\nFollowing deliberation and discussion, the Board determined that, subject to negotiation of the terms of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction\ndocuments, it believed that the valuation communicated on May 19, 2022 was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, and was\nsupportive of moving forward with exploring a potential transaction with CD&R and TPG and, therefore, of granting CD&R a limited waiver (the \u201cLimited\nWaiver\u201d) of the Standstill Agreement in order to permit the submission of a proposal, as well as to permit CD&R to pursue, develop and, if later approved\nby the Board upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, enter into a transaction contemplated by such proposal. Following the Board\nmeeting, Mr. Laskawy called Mr. Sachdev and relayed the Board\u2019s determination.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company granted CD&R the Limited Waiver. Following the granting of the Limited Waiver, on May 19, 2022, Debevoise, on behalf\nof CD&R and TPG, submitted a letter setting forth CD&R\u2019s and TPG\u2019s non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company common\nstock that were not owned by investment funds managed by CD&R for cash consideration of $21.00 per share of Company common stock (the\n\u201cCD&R/TPG Proposal\u201d) to the Transaction Committee. The CD&R/TPG Proposal represented a 37.5% premium to the closing price of $15.27 of the\nCompany common stock on May 13, 2022 (the last trading day before the trading in the Company common stock appeared to be affected by market\nrumors or otherwise), a 38.8% premium to the Company\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 13, 2022 and a 34.8% premium to the\nCompany\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the\nCD&R/TPG Proposal was publicly filed.\nOn May 20, 2022, CD&R publicly disclosed the proposal letter in an amendment to its Schedule 13D filings with respect to the Company. On May 20,\n2022, the Company filed a current report on Form 8-K disclosing the granting of the Limited Waiver and the receipt of the CD&R/TPG Proposal.\nIn connection with the delivery of the CD&R/TPG Proposal, representatives of Debevoise provided representatives of Weil with a revised draft of the\nMerger Agreement shared by the Company in the virtual data room on April 20, 2022. From May 19, 2022 through May 24, 2022, the Company, CD&R,\nTPG, Parent and their respective legal advisors negotiated the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents. Significant areas of discussion and\nnegotiation included: (i) the level of conditionality in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to domestic and foreign antitrust and other regulatory\nfilings, (ii) the regulatory efforts standards and the standard for possible divestitures or other remedies in connection with applicable antitrust and other\nregulatory clearances, (iii) the termination fees payable by the Company and Parent in certain circumstances, (iv) the financing and financing cooperation\nobligations of Parent and the Company and their impact on transaction certainty, (v) the \u201cdrop dead date,\u201d and (vi) the scope of the representations and\nwarranties and covenants of the parties.\nOn May 23, 2022, the Transaction Committee and the Board, which, for the avoidance of doubt, did not include the Recused Directors, held a meeting\nattended by members of the Company\u2019s management and\n31\nTable of Contents\nrepresentatives of the Financial Advisors and Weil, at which the Transaction Committee and the Board discussed the potential transaction with Parent.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Transaction Committee and the Board its financial analyses of the merger consideration of $21.00\nper share of Company common stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its presentation, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board its\noral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing on May 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of May 24, 2022, and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Company\ncommon stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be paid to the holders of Company common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs\u2019s opinion, please see below under\nthe section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014 Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.\u201d Further, representatives of Weil reviewed with the directors their\nfiduciary duties and a summary of the key terms of the draft Merger Agreement, as of such date. Following the presentations by Goldman Sachs and\nWeil, and after further discussing the CD&R/TPG Proposal, the Transaction Committee and the Board discussed the potential reasons for and against the\npotential transaction (see below under the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014 Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the\nMerger\u201d). At the conclusion of the discussions, the Transaction Committee unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and\nthe consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii)\ndetermined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) recommended to the Board to adopt and\ndeclare advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement. The Board, other than the Recused Directors, acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, unanimously (i)\napproved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to\nthe conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,\n(iii) resolved to recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) directed that the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted to the stockholders of the Company for its adoption. The Board authorized the Company\u2019s management to, together with the Company\u2019s\nadvisors, finalize the negotiation of the outstanding items in the transaction documentation in accordance with the Board\u2019s guidance.\nDuring the course of May 23, 2022 and May 24, 2022, Company management and the Company\u2019s advisors finalized negotiating the transaction\ndocumentation with CD&R, TPG, Parent and their advisors.\nOn May 24, 2022, the Company and Parent executed the Merger Agreement, concurrently with which the Company, Parent and CD&R VFC Holdings\nexecuted the Support and Rollover Agreement.\nOn May 25, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of the Company common stock on NASDAQ, the Company and Parent issued press releases\nannouncing the transaction and the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger\nThe Board (which, for purposes of this section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the\nMerger,\u201d means the Board without the participation of the Recused Directors), formed the Transaction Committee to evaluate and consider strategic\nalternatives that may be available to the Company, including any potential transaction involving CD&R.\nAfter careful consideration, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, the Transaction Committee unanimously (a) approved and\ndeclared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions\nset forth in the Merger Agreement, (b) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (c)\nrecommended to the Board to adopt and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the\n32\nTable of Contents\nTransactions, including the Merger, and recommend to the stockholders of the Company the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and the Board (other\nthan the Recused Directors), acting upon the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the\nMerger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (iii) directed that the Merger\nAgreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the\nCompany adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, based on its evaluation and having received the recommendation of the Transaction Committee, the\nBoard recommends that the Company\u2019s stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal\nand \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal. In addition, the Transaction Committee and the Board believe that the merger is fair to the Company\u2019s\n\u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act.\nIn evaluating the Merger, the Transaction Committee and the Board consulted with independent legal and financial advisors, as well as the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team, and considered a number of factors that supported its decision to approve the Merger Agreement (not necessarily in order of relative\nimportance) and the Merger, including the following:\n\u2022\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all\ncash, which provides the Company\u2019s stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Company common stock and\nenables the Company\u2019s stockholders to realize value that has been created by the Company and does not expose them to any future risks\nrelated to the business or the financial markets generally, as compared to the Company remaining independent (especially when viewed\nagainst the potential risks and uncertainties inherent in Covetrus\u2019 business, including risks related to management\u2019s standalone plan and\nchanging competitive dynamics). Specifically, among other things, the Transaction Committee and the Board considered:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for the Company\u2019s stockholders, including a 39% premium to the\nCompany\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of the unaffected date of May 13, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe trading history of the Company and the Merger Consideration relative to such history\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that CD&R and TPG (together, the \u201cSponsors\u201d) were willing to\npay considering the negotiations between the parties.\n\u2022\nValue Relative to Stand-Alone Prospects of the Company. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger\nConsideration compares favorably to the potential value of the Company and the Company common stock if the Company were to remain as\na stand-alone entity after taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with this alternative, in light of a number of factors,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nassessing the Company\u2019s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected financial performance\nand the nature of the animal health industry in which the Company operates, including recent industry trends and changing\ncompetitive dynamics\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company on a stand-alone basis, and the risks and uncertainties associated with\nthose alternatives\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties relating to the Company\u2019s efforts to develop and market new products, as well as the complexities\nassociated with managing a business comprising both a technology platform and a distribution business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties related to increased competition in the markets in which the Company competes or may compete in the\nfuture\u037e and\n33\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Company\u2019s competitors may be more successful in gaining access to talent and resources and the negative\nresult that such competitive pressure may have on the ability of the Company to execute on its core business objectives.\n\u2022\nThe Sale Process: The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered:\n\u2022\nthat a sale process was conducted and that the Company, together with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, communicated with 24 potential\nstrategic and financial sponsor parties believed by the Company, Goldman Sachs and Lincoln to be most likely to be interested in, and\ncapable of entering into, a transaction to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthat of the 24 potential acquirers contacted, 17 entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company and were granted due\ndiligence access to the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthat only one of the potential acquirers (TPG) that engaged in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company\nsubmitted an indication of interest with regard to the acquisition of the entire Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, following the public disclosure on May 20, 2022 of the Sponsors\u2019 proposal to acquire the shares of Company common\nstock that CD&R VFC Holdings did not already own at a price of $21.00 per share, none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or Lincoln\nreceived any inquiries from any third parties concerning a potential acquisition of all or any portion of the Company or any other\nstrategic alternative. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered that, if any third parties were interested in exploring a\ntransaction with the Company, such potential acquirers would have been motivated to approach the Company during the period\nfollowing the May 20, 2022 public disclosure of the Sponsors\u2019 $21.00 per share proposal, and considered, after consultation with\nGoldman Sachs and Lincoln, that no other potential transaction party was likely to be both willing and able to acquire all of the\noutstanding shares of the Company at a valuation of $21.00 per share or greater\u037e and\n\u2022\nSponsors\u2019 indication to the Transaction Committee that the $21.00 merger consideration was the highest price they were willing to\noffer, and that such offer had been increased because of the negotiating efforts of the Transaction Committee and the Company\u2019s\nadvisors, and the Transaction Committee\u2019s belief, after discussion with its advisors and based on the course of negotiations with the\nSponsors that $21.00 per share was the maximum price that the Sponsors would offer.\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the result\nof robust arm\u2019s-length negotiations conducted by the Transaction Committee, with the knowledge and at the direction of the Board, and\nwith the assistance of independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel.\n\u2022\nOpinion of Financial Advisors. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May 24, 2022 that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the limitations,\nqualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the offer price of $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the\nholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a\nfinancial point of view to such Company stockholders, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation prior to obtaining the stockholder approval in specified\ncircumstances relating to a superior proposal or intervening event, subject to\n34\nTable of Contents\nParent\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the termination fee of $88,315,000\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions\n(including certain rights of Parent to match the superior proposal and payment of the termination fee of $88,315,000)\u037e\n\u2022\nthat affiliates of the Sponsors provided limited guarantees with respect to their portion of the payment of the termination fee of\n$197,950,000 that may be owed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as well as certain reimbursement obligations that may be\nowed by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the limited\nguarantees\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, after discussion with the Company\u2019s advisors, that the $88,315,000 termination fee, which constitutes\napproximately 2.9% of the Company\u2019s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a superior proposal from being made\u037e\n\u2022\nParent having obtained committed debt financing from reputable financial institutions and committed equity financing from affiliated\nfunds of the Sponsors in an aggregate amount sufficient to fund the required amounts\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision obligating Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done all things necessary, proper\nor advisable to obtain the proceeds of the debt and equity financing on terms (including the \u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions) and conditions\nno less favorable to Parent than those described in the commitment letters\u037e\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the limited number and nature of the conditions to complete the\nMerger (including regulatory conditions), and the provisions of the Merger Agreement requiring Parent to, subject to certain\nexceptions, use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary,\nproper or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations,\napprovals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or\nany governmental entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.\n\u2022\nOpportunity for the Company\u2019s Stockholders to Vote. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Merger would\nbe subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders, and the Company\u2019s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote\nfor or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting.\n\u2022\nTiming of Completion. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the\nTransactions, including the Merger, and the structure of the Merger and concluded that the Transactions, including the Merger, could be\ncompleted in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered that the potential\nfor closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which the Company\u2019s business would be subject to the\npotential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.\n\u2022\nOperating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides the Company sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in\nthe ordinary course consistent with past practices until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the termination of the Merger\nAgreement (as more fully described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Covenants Regarding Conduct of Business by Covetrus Prior to\nMerger\u201d).\n35\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. The Company\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of\nParent and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nCommitment by CD&R. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the commitment of CD&R VFC Holdings in the Support and\nRollover Agreement to, among other things:\n\u2022\nvote or cause to be voted at the special meeting any shares of Company common stock owned by it in favor of the Merger and the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement and the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or necessary or desirable in\nfurtherance of the Merger and the other Transactions, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nSupport and Rollover Agreement, and against any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the\nconditions to the consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled (as more fully described under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014CD&R\u2019s Obligation to Vote in Favor of the Merger\u201d and \u201cSupport and Rollover Agreement\u201d).\n\u2022\nUnderstanding of Different Interests. the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) made their evaluations of\nthe Merger Agreement and the Merger based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the\ninterests of CD&R and its affiliates in the Merger.\nIn the course of their deliberations, The Transaction Committee and the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors\nconcerning the Transactions, including:\n\u2022\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all cash\ntransaction means that the Company would no longer exist as an independent public company following the consummation of the Merger\nand that the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings) will not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will\nnot benefit from any appreciation in value of the Surviving Corporation.\n\u2022\nClosing Conditions and Financing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019\n\u2022\nClosing Conditions and Financing. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019\nobligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders, as well as\nthe risk that the equity or debt financing contemplated by the equity and debt commitment letters will not be obtained, resulting in Parent\nand Merger Sub not having sufficient funds to complete the Transactions.\n\u2022\nRisks Associated with Parent and Merger Sub. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that Parent and Merger Sub\nare newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the limited guarantees, provided by each of the Equity Investors, guarantees\nParent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement only with respect to payment of the termination fee of $197,950,000\npayable by Parent and certain other reimbursement obligations.\n\u2022\nInterim Operating Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which, despite providing sufficient\nflexibility for the Company to operate its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices, could delay or prevent the\nCompany from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take with respect to the operations\nof the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.\n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the possibility that the\nTransactions, including the Merger, might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have\nexperienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transactions\u037e\n36\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Company will have incurred significant transaction costs\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s continuing business relationships with customers, partners and employees may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe trading price of shares of Company common stock could be materially and adversely affected\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perceptions of the Company\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that subject to certain exceptions, the\nMerger Agreement precludes the Company from soliciting or entertaining alternative acquisition proposals and requires the Company to\npay Parent a termination fee of $88,315,000 in certain circumstances.\n\u2022\nRemedies. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the Company\u2019s remedies in the event that the Merger\nAgreement is terminated may be limited to the termination fee of $197,950,000, payable by Parent under certain circumstances and certain\nassociated enforcement costs and reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to compensate the Company for any damage\ncaused.\n\u2022\nEffects of Transaction Announcement. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the effect of the public announcement of the\nMerger Agreement, including effects on the Company\u2019s stock price, and the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel during\nthe pendency of the Transactions, as well as the potential for legal proceedings, judgments or settlements following the announcement of\nthe Transactions and the associated costs, burden and inconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and\nsettlements.\n\u2022\nRisks Related to CD&R. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that CD&R VFC Holdings\u2019s ownership interest in\nthe Company would likely be taken into account by third parties considering whether to make an unsolicited acquisition proposal prior to\nthe receipt of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders, and the fact that, if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated in connection with the Company\u2019s entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, such third parties would\nlikely seek to have CD&R VFC Holdings agree to vote its shares of Company common stock in favor of such superior proposal.\n\u2022\nTiming Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that\ncompletion of the Merger depends on factors outside of the Company\u2019s or Sponsors\u2019 control (including the approval of the Merger by the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the\nexecution of the Merger Agreement could divert the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and have an adverse impact on the Company,\nincluding its client and other business relationships.\n\u2022\nTaxable Consideration. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the fact that the exchange of Company common stock for\ncash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nOther Risks. The Transaction Committee and the Board considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy\nstatement, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 incorporated by reference\nherein and the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Transaction Committee and the Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were\noutweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.\nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Transaction Committee and the Board also considered that some of the Company\u2019s directors\nand executive officers have interests that may be different from,\n37\nTable of Contents\nor in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them at the time it\napproved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the Company\u2019s stockholders. See the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Transaction Committee and the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but\nincludes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Transaction Committee and the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors\nconsidered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters,\nneither the Transaction Committee nor the Board find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors\nconsidered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.\nNeither the Transaction Committee nor the Board undertook to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any\nparticular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Transaction Committee and the Board each based their\nrecommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the Transaction\nCommittee and the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth\nin the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.\u201d\nThe Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) believe that sufficient procedural safeguards were and are present to\nensure the fairness of the Merger and to permit the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) to represent effectively the\ninterests of the unaffiliated stockholders. These procedural safeguards include the following:\n\u2022\nthe Board formed the Transaction Committee, consisting of three of the Company\u2019s independent directors who are independent of, and not\naffiliated with, CD&R or its affiliates, to evaluate and consider any potential or actual proposal from CD&R and any other alternative\nproposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company, including the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe members of the Transaction Committee will not personally benefit from the consummation of the Transactions in a manner different from\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings and the other holders of excluded shares), except for indemnification and\ncontinuing directors and officers liability insurance coverage and the vesting of certain Company equity awards upon the closing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company retained independent financial and legal advisors to evaluate the Merger, and the Transaction Committee was empowered to\nand did review and negotiate the Merger Agreement, the Transactions, including the Merger and the Merger Consideration, and any\nalternatives thereto, and to make a recommendation to the Board as to what actions, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect\nthereto\u037e\n\u2022\nat the direction of the Transaction Committee, the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, were\nextensively negotiated by the Transaction Committee and the Company\u2019s independent financial and legal advisors, and were closely\nreviewed and scrutinized by the Transaction Committee, and, through negotiations, the Transaction Committee was able to increase the\nMerger Consideration from $20.00 per share to $21.00 per share\u037e\n\u2022\nthe approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of\nCompany common stock entitled to vote on such matter (as more fully described under \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Vote Required for\nApproval\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe various terms of the Merger Agreement, including the ability of the Company to receive, negotiate and, under specified circumstances,\nto terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal (as more fully described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d)\u037e\n38\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) made their evaluations of the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of CD&R and its affiliates in\nthe Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe members of the Transaction Committee and the Board met frequently through the execution of the Merger Agreement to receive\nupdates\u037e to review, among other things, the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, its strategic and\ncompetitive positioning and historical and projected financial performance, its valuation, its long-range plans and the risk in achieving those\nprospects and plans, as well as industry, economic and market conditions and trends\u037e to review the Company\u2019s strategic and commercial\nalternatives and options, including the results of the sale process conducted and the likelihood or unlikelihood of other parties being willing\nand able to engage in a stockholder-value-maximizing strategic transaction with the Company\u037e and to consider and evaluate discussions\nwith CD&R and, ultimately, the proposal from the Sponsors\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe members of the Board who are affiliated with CD&R have recused themselves and were excluded from all deliberations with respect to\nthe limited waiver of the standstill provisions of the Investment Agreement to allow the Sponsors to submit a proposal, the subsequent\nnegotiation, evaluation and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.\nIn the course of reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, the\nTransaction Committee and Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not consider the liquidation value of the Company, and did not believe it to be a\nrelevant methodology, because (1) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (2) they considered determining a liquidation value to be\nimpracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of the Company and (3) the Company will continue to operate its business\nfollowing the Merger. Further, the Transaction Committee and Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not consider net book value, an accounting\nconcept, of the Company as a factor because they believe that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern\nbut rather is indicative of historical costs and because net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions,\ntrends in the industries in which the Company operates or the business risks inherent in those industries. The Transaction Committee and Board (other\nthan the Recused Directors) were not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company\u2019s assets, or a purchase of a\ncontrolling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than CD&R, TPG and Company A with respect\nto the current transaction in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) did not seek to establish a pre-merger going concern value for the\nCompany to determine the fairness of the Merger, as they believed that such value was adequately reflected in the various analyses summarized in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d that they considered in making their respective\ndeterminations. In making its determination as to the fairness of the Merger, the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors)\nconsidered a number of factors as summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d including the opinion and analyses provided by Goldman Sachs as more fully summarized in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

        "Section Text": "Position of the CD&R Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, the CD&R Entities may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required\nto express their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. Parent and Merger Sub are making the statements included in this\nsection solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The view of\nParent and Merger Sub as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a\n39Table of Contents\nrecommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal. The CD&R Entities have\ninterests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition to, those of the unaffiliated stockholders of the Company.\nThe CD&R Entities did not participate in the deliberation of the Transaction Committee or the Board regarding, nor did they receive advice from the\nrespective legal or other advisors of the Transaction Committee or the Board as to, the fairness of the Merger. While two directors affiliated with the\nCD&R Entities are on the Board, as discussed in \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Background of the Merger,\u201d such Recused Directors were excluded from all Board\ndeliberations relating to the approval of the Merger Agreement. The CD&R Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any\nvaluation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. Based on, among other things, the\nfactors considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Board and the Transaction Committee discussed in \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons\nfor the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d (which analysis and resulting conclusions the CD&R Entities adopt), the CD&R\nEntities believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the unaffiliated stockholders. In particular, the CD&R Entities considered the following:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the shares of Company common stock, including the market performance of the shares of\nCompany common stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the\nMerger Consideration of $21.00 per share represented a premium of approximately 39% to the Company\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average\nprice per share as of the unaffected date of May 13, 2022 and a premium of approximately 35% to the Company\u2019s 30-day volume weighted\naverage price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to\nacquire the Company was publicly filed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors) unanimously approved and declared advisable\nthe Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject\nto the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and\nits stockholders (including the unaffiliated stockholders)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing the unaffiliated stockholders to immediately realize a certain and fair value\nfor their shares, which value represents a significant premium over the Company\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of the\nunaffected date of May 13, 2022 and over the Company\u2019s 30-day volume weighted average price per share as of May 19, 2022, the last\ntrading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the unaffiliated stockholders without the delays that would otherwise be necessary in\norder to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that there are no conditions to the Merger that are unlikely to be satisfied, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be\nconsummated and that the consideration to be paid to the unaffiliated stockholders in the Merger will be received\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe potential risks to the Company of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and global\neconomic uncertainty.\nThe CD&R Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the unaffiliated stockholders based upon, among other things, the following\nfactors:\n\u2022\nthe fact that a sale process was conducted, which included communication by the Company, together with Goldman Sachs and Lincoln, with\n24 potential strategic and financial sponsor parties believed by the Company, Goldman Sachs and Lincoln to be most likely to be interested\nin, and capable of entering into, a transaction to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company\u037e\n40\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Board was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the CD&R Entities in the Merger differed from those of the\nunaffiliated stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Recused Directors were excluded from certain Board discussions (including all discussions related to the Board\u2019s\nconsideration of the initial offer from TPG and the subsequent offer from CD&R and TPG and the evaluation and negotiation of the\nTransactions)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Board formed a transaction committee consisting solely of non-management independent members of the Board not\naffiliated with CD&R, which was empowered to and did review and negotiate the Merger Agreement, the Transactions, including the Merger\nand the Merger Consideration, and any alternatives thereto, and was empowered to make a recommendation to the Board as to what\nactions, if any, should be taken by the Company with respect thereto\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Company retained, and the Transaction Committee and the Board had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal\nand financial advisors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Transaction Committee\u2019s arm\u2019s length negotiations with Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nnotwithstanding the fact that the opinion of Goldman Sachs was delivered solely to the Transaction Committee and the Board, and not to\nthe CD&R Entities, in connection with their consideration of the Merger, and is not a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of\nCompany common stock should vote with respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal or any other matter, and that the CD&R Entities are\nnot entitled to, nor did they, rely on such opinion, the fact that the Transaction Committee and the Board received an opinion from Goldman\nSachs that, as of May 24, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set\nforth therein, the $21.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of\nCompany common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in\ndiscussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding acquisition proposals that constitute, or are reasonably likely to lead to, superior\nproposals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement related to a superior proposal, subject to paying Parent a termination fee of $88,315,000 in cash, subject to and in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights to the Company\u2019s stockholders who comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for\nexercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company common stock.\nThe CD&R Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the proposed\nMerger, including:\n\u2022\nthe unaffiliated stockholders will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in value or growth of the Company\u2019s business and will\nnot benefit from any potential sale of the Company or its assets to a third party in the future\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all\u037e\n\u2022\nthat Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the funding commitments of the Equity\nInvestors and the Debt Commitment Parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which\nmay delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business\n41\nTable of Contents\nopportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company pending\ncompletion of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could potentially have on the Company\u2019s business\nand relationships with its employees, vendors and customers\u037e\n\u2022\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating,\nknowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer constituting, or that could reasonably\nbe expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including payment to\nParent of a termination fee of $88,315,000 in cash, and the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity\nfor Parent to make revisions to its proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire the\nCompany\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to the Company\u2019s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the CD&R Entities in connection with its evaluation of the\nfairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but includes all material factors considered by them. The CD&R Entities did not find it practicable\nto, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather,\nthe CD&R Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The CD&R Entities believe\nthese factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated stockholders. This\nposition should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The CD&R Entities\nmake no recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their shares relating to the Merger. The CD&R Entities attempted to\nnegotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the unaffiliated stockholders of the Company, and, accordingly, did\nnot negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such stockholders.\nBased on the CD&R Entities\u2019 knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, the Transaction Committee and the Board, as well\nas discussions with the Transaction Committee, the Board and members of the Company\u2019s senior management regarding the Company and its business\nand the factors considered by, and findings of, the Transaction Committee and the Board and discussed in \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d the CD&R Entities believe that the Merger is fair to the unaffiliated stockholders.\nCertain Financial Projections Utilized in Connection with the Merger\nAlthough Covetrus periodically provides guidance to the public regarding its financial performance for the then-current fiscal year, Covetrus does not, as\na matter of course, publicly disclose other financial forecasts given, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of these\nforecasts and the associated underlying assumptions.\nHowever, Covetrus is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management (the\n\u201cFinancial Forecasts\u201d) that has not previously been publicly disclosed, in order to provide Covetrus stockholders with access to information that was\nmade available to the Transaction Committee and the Board in connection with their evaluation of the proposed Merger and the Merger Consideration.\nThe Financial Forecasts with respect to Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2025 were\nprovided to the Sponsors in February 2022. In addition, the Financial Forecasts, including for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through\nDecember 31, 2028, and with respect to Unlevered Free Cash Flow, were provided to Goldman Sachs and were used by\n42\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Transaction Committee and the Board and the performance of the related financial\nanalyses, as described in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d beginning on page 45, but the Financial\nForecasts for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2026 through December 31, 2028 were not provided to Parent or the Sponsors prior to entering into the\nMerger Agreement.\nThe inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement is not intended to influence any Covetrus stockholder with respect to the Merger\nAgreement Proposal or for any other purpose, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to a stockholder\u2019s shares of Company\ncommon stock.\nThe Financial Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, nor were they prepared with a view\ntoward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. These projections are not fact and should not be relied upon as\nnecessarily indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial\ninformation. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the Financial Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the Financial\nForecasts or the achievability of the results reflected in the Financial Forecasts, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with,\nthe Financial Forecasts. The Financial Forecasts may differ from published analyst estimates and the Financial Forecasts do not take into account any\nevents or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger (nor, relatedly, any failure of the Merger to be\nconsummated).\nAlthough presented with numerical specificity, the Financial Forecasts are subjective in many respects and, thus, are subject to interpretation and reflect\nnumerous variables, estimates and assumptions made by Covetrus management that Covetrus management believed were reasonable at the time\nprepared, taking into account relevant information available to management at that time. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in such\nFinancial Forecasts not being achieved include the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the\nMerger Agreement and the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the\nprincipal terms thereof or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the Merger, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or\nrefuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Transactions, and risks and uncertainties pertaining to Covetrus\u2019 business, including the factors\nlisted under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in Covetrus\u2019 reports filed with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. In addition,\nthe Financial Forecasts may be affected by Covetrus\u2019 ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period. The\nassumptions upon which the Financial Forecasts are based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, industry performance and\ncompetition, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, and other future events, and future business decisions that may not\nbe realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including,\namong other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industry in which Covetrus operates, and the risks\nand uncertainties described under the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d beginning on page 115, all of\nwhich are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond Covetrus\u2019 control. The Financial Forecasts also reflect assumptions\nthat are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for Covetrus\u2019\nbusiness, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not\nanticipated when the such forecasts were prepared. Therefore, Covetrus cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the Financial\nForecasts will be realized. In addition, given that the Financial Forecasts pertain to multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater\nuncertainty with each successive year beyond their preparation. The estimates and assumptions in early periods have a\ncompounding effect on the projections shown for later periods. Thus, any failure of an estimate or assumption to\n43\nTable of Contents\nbe reflective of actual results in an early period would have a greater effect on projected results failing to be reflective of actual events in later periods.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Financial Forecasts will be realized, and actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those\nshown.\nThe inclusion of the Financial Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Covetrus, Goldman Sachs, the\nSponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the CD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or\nconsider the Financial Forecasts necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the Financial Forecasts should not be relied upon as such. None of\nCovetrus, Goldman Sachs, the Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the CD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Financial Forecasts, and Covetrus undertakes no obligation to update or\notherwise revise or reconcile the Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date such Financial Forecasts were generated or to reflect\nthe occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts are shown to be in error. None of\nCovetrus, or, to the knowledge of Covetrus, the Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub or the CD&R Entities intends to make publicly available any update or\nother revisions to the Financial Forecasts, unless required by applicable law. None of Covetrus, Goldman Sachs, the Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub, the\nCD&R Entities or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any\nstockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of Covetrus compared to the information contained in the Financial Forecasts or that\nforecasted results will be achieved.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, included in the Financial Forecasts, are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial\nperformance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow were utilized by Goldman\nSachs in connection with its opinion and by the Transaction Committee and the Board in connection their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules that\nwould otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures\nincluded in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy\nstatement. In addition, reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its\nopinion or by the Transaction Committee or the Board in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Covetrus has not provided a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA or Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and any non-GAAP financial measures as\nused by Covetrus may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are certain limitations in non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Financial Forecasts:\n($ in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\nRevenue\n$ 4,916\n$ 5,330\n$ 5,775\n$ 6,233\n$ 6,600\n$ 6,918\n$ 7,208\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n285\n$\n349\n$\n397\n$\n459\n$\n500\n$\n537\n$\n570\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Covetrus, before interest expense, net income tax expense, net depreciation and\namortization, as adjusted by excluding (i) share-based compensation, (ii) strategic consulting costs, transaction costs, formation of Covetrus\nexpenses, separation programs and executive severance (collectively, \u201cSpecified Expenses\u201d), (iii) goodwill impairment charges, capital structure-\nrelated fees, other impairments, the proportionate share of the adjustments of consolidated and nonconsolidated affiliates where Covetrus\nownership is less than 100%, and (iv) other income and expense items, net.\n44\nTable of Contents\n($ in millions)\nQ2-Q4\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(1)\n$\n170\n$ 175\n$ 197\n$ 247\n$ 278\n$ 319\n$ 345\n(1)\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (i) less Specified Expenses, (ii) less cash tax expense, (iii) less capital expenditures and\n(iv) adjusted for net working capital changes over the projection period.\nThe material estimates and assumptions made by Covetrus management in connection with the Financial\nForecasts include:\n\u2022\nWith respect to Covetrus\u2019s distribution business, projected compound annual growth rate in revenue through 2025 of approximately 6% to\n9%, depending upon the geographic region\u037e\n\u2022\nWith respect to Covetrus\u2019s technology business (which includes SmartPak, Covetrus\u2019s practice information management software systems\nand its North American veterinary storefront), projected compound annual growth rate in revenue through 2025 of approximately 15.5%\u037e\n\u2022\nWith respect to Covetrus\u2019s distribution business, improvement of gross margin of approximately 0.6% through 2025 as a result of, among\nother things, increasing penetration rates of high-margin private label products (depending upon the geographic region), partially offset by\nsupplier margin pressure and customer consolidation\u037e\n\u2022\nWith respect to Covetrus\u2019s technology business, improvement of gross margin of approximately 1.4% through 2025\u037e\n\u2022\nRevenue growth and improvements of gross margin for 2026 through 2028 assumed generally in line with prior years\u037e\n\u2022\nDecline in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, reflecting scale and leverage in Covetrus\u2019s technology business and continued\ngains in operating efficiency in Covetrus\u2019s distribution business, partially offset by 3% annual inflation\u037e and\nCapital expenditures and changes in net working capital generally scaling in line with revenue.\nFor the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Financial Forecasts.\nCOVETRUS DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE ABOVE FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING\nAFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE\nASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT REALIZED.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

The full text of the written presentation made by Goldman Sachs to the Board and the\nTransaction Committee on May 23, 2022 has been attached as Exhibit (c)(2) to the Schedule 13e-3 in connection with the Transactions, including the\nMerger, and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety (the \u201cGS May 2022 Presentation\u201d). The following summary, however, does not purport to be\na complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or\nweight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The\ntables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before\nMay 19, 2022, the last trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed, and\nis not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for the shares of Company common stock for the\nperiod beginning on February 8, 2019 and ending May 19, 2022. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of shares of\nCompany common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Company common stock on May 19, 2022, the\nlast trading day before the Schedule 13D/A disclosing the proposal by CD&R and TPG to acquire the Company was publicly filed, (ii) the volume\nweighted average price (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as \u201cVWAP\u201d) per share of Company common stock for the\npreceding 30-, 60- and 90-trading day periods ended May 19, 2022, (iii) the closing price per share of Company common stock on May 13, 2022, the last\ntrading day before it appeared that the price of the shares of Company common stock may have been affected by market rumors or otherwise, and (iv) the\nVWAP per share of Company common stock for the preceding 30-, 60- and 90-trading day periods ended May 13, 2022.\nThis analysis indicated that the price per share of Company common stock to be paid to Company stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nrepresented:\n\u2022\na premium of 16.5% based on the closing price per share of Company common stock of $18.02 on May 19, 2022\u037e\n47\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\na premium of 34.8% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $15.58 for the 30-trading day period ended May 19, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 29.4% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.23 for the 60-trading day period ended May 19, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 25.7% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.71 for the 90-trading day period ended May 19, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 37.5% based on the closing price per share of Company common stock of $15.27 on May 13, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 38.8% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $15.13 for the 30-trading day period ended May 13, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 30.3% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.12 for the 60-trading day period ended May 13, 2022\u037e\nand\n\u2022\na premium of 25.6% based on the VWAP per share of Company common stock of $16.71 for the 90-trading day period ended May 13, 2022.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the\nCompany. Using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.5%, reflecting estimates of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of March 31, 2022, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the second, third and fourth quarters of\n2022 and the years 2023 through 2028 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated\nby applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the\nCompany, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied exit terminal year EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from 6.5x to 10.7x). Goldman Sachs derived\nsuch discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as\n\u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-\ntax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the net debt of the Company of $904 million as\nof March 31, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, to derive\na range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully\ndiluted outstanding shares of the Company as of May 20, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use\nby the management of the Company, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Company common\nstock ranging from $14.76 to $27.02.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative\nfuture price per share of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of the\nCompany\u2019s equity as a function of the Company\u2019s estimated future earnings and its assumed price to future earnings per share multiple. For this analysis,\nGoldman Sachs used the Forecasts to derive a range of theoretical future enterprise values for the Company for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by\napplying a range of illustrative multiples of enterprise value to next twelve months (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement\nas \u201cNTM\u201d) EBITDA (which is referred to for purposes of this section of the proxy statement as \u201cNTM EV/EBITDA\u201d) of\n48\nTable of Contents\n10.0x to 13.0x to NTM EBITDA estimates for the Company, based on the Forecasts. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs\nutilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical NTM EV/EBITDA multiples for the shares of Company common stock\nduring the period beginning January 1, 2022, and ending May 19, 2022, and certain selected distribution companies described in the section below\ncaptioned \u201c\u2014Selected Public Company Comparables.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs then derived a range of theoretical future values per share of Company common stock for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024 by\nsubtracting the Company\u2019s projected net debt as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, and dividing the result by the estimated fully-diluted\nshares of Company common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, all as reflected in the Forecasts. Using an\nillustrative discount rate of 11.7%, reflecting Goldman Sachs\u2019 estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value the\nrange of theoretical future values per share of Company common stock it derived for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs derived the\nillustrative discount rate of 11.7% by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well\nas certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of\nCompany common stock of $17.32 to $27.73.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the distribution,\ncompanion animal health and healthcare information technology industries since 2012 with a total enterprise value of at least $1 billion.\nFor each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on\nthe consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s EBITDA over the last twelve month (which is referred to for purposes of\nthis section of the proxy statement as \u201cLTM\u201d) period ended prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction (which is referred to for purposes of\nthis section of the proxy statement as \u201cEV/LTM EBITDA\u201d). While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions is directly\ncomparable to the Company, the companies included in the selected transactions are companies that operate in the distribution, companion animal health\nor healthcare information technology industries with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company\u2019s\nresults, market size and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEV/LTM EBITDA Multiple\nDistribution Industry\nJanuary 2021\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation\nMajority of Alliance Healthcare\nBusiness from Walgreens Boots\nAlliance, Inc.\n12.0x\nOctober 2012\nMcKesson Corporation\nPSS World Medical, Inc.\n11.9x\nOctober 2013\nMcKesson Corporation\nCelesio AG\n11.0x\nAnimal Health Industry\nJanuary 2015\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation\nMWI Veterinary Supply, Inc.\n19.3x\nJanuary 2017\nMars, Incorporated\nVCA Inc.\n18.3x\nMay 2015\nPatterson Companies, Inc.\nAnimal Health International, Inc.\n16.2x\nMay 2013\nBC Partners, Inc.\nAllflex Europe UK Ltd.\n13.0x\nDecember 2014\nBC Partners, Inc.\nPetSmart, Inc.\n9.3x\nHealthcare Information Technology Industry\nJune 2018\nVerscend Technologies, Inc.\nCotiviti Holdings, Inc.\n18.0x\n49\nTable of Contents\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEV/LTM EBITDA Multiple\nJanuary 2021\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated\nChange Healthcare, Inc.\n14.9x\nDecember 2021\nOracle Corporation\nCerner Corporation\n14.8x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and experience, Goldman\nSachs applied an illustrative range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 19.3x to the Company\u2019s LTM Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period\nended March 31, 2022 of $250 million, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of the\nCompany, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values the net\ndebt of the Company of $904 million as of March 31, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs divided the results by the number of fully\ndiluted outstanding shares of Company common stock as of May 20, 2022, as provided by the management of the Company and approved for Goldman\nSachs\u2019 use by the management of the Company, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied values per share of Company common\nstock of $12.74 to $27.02.\nPremia Paid Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 36 acquisition transactions\nthat closed during the time period from January 1, 2010 through May 18, 2022 involving a public company in the healthcare industry, excluding\ntransactions involving targets in the biopharmaceutical sector, involving a target based in the United States where the disclosed enterprise value for the\ntransaction was between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the mean, 25th\npercentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to\nannouncement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a mean premium of 36.2% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile\npremium of 23.9% and 75th percentile premium of 41.6% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative\npremia of 23.9% to 41.6% to the (i) closing price per share of Company common stock of $18.02 as of May 19, 2022 and calculated a range of implied\nequity values per share of Company common stock of $22.33 to $25.52 and (ii) unaffected closing price per share of Company common stock of $15.27 as\nof May 13, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Company common stock of $18.92 to $21.62.\nSelected Public Company Comparables. Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared EV/EBITDA multiples for the\nCompany and the following selected group of publicly traded companies in the distribution industry, each with a market capitalization in excess of $1\nbillion and headquartered in the U.S. and listed on a U.S. stock exchange, which are referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the \u201cselected\ncompanies\u201d:\n\u2022\nHenry Schein, Inc.\n\u2022\nMcKesson Corporation\n\u2022\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation\n\u2022\nPatterson Companies, Inc.\n\u2022\nCardinal Health, Inc.\n\u2022\nOwens & Minor, Inc.\nAlthough none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Goldman Sachs selected these companies because they are publicly\ntraded companies that operate in the distribution industry with certain operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain\noperations of the Company.\n50\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of May 19, 2022 as a multiple of EBITDA for calendar year 2022 for each of the Company\nand the selected companies, in each case based on Institutional Brokers\u2019 Estimate System estimates and publicly available market data.\nThe results of this analysis are summarized as follows:\nSelected Companies\nEV/2022E\nEBITDA\nMultiple\nCompany (as of May 19, 2022)\n12.7x\nCompany (as of May 13, 2022)\n11.3x\nHenry Schein, Inc.\n12.0x\nMcKesson Corporation\n11.3x\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation\n11.2x\nPatterson Companies, Inc.\n10.3x\nCardinal Health, Inc.\n9.5x\nOwens & Minor, Inc.\n8.6x\nOther Information. For reference purposes only, Goldman Sachs reviewed (i) the price targets for the Company\u2019s common stock reflected in five publicly\navailable Wall Street research analyst reports as of May 19, 2022, which indicated low to high price targets per share of Company common stock of $16.00\nto $26.00, with a median price target per share of Company common stock of $22.00 per share, and (ii) the 52-week trading range of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock based upon market data for the period ending May 19, 2022, which indicated low to high intra-day prices per share of Company common\nstock during such period of $13.39 to $29.02.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to the Company or Parent or the contemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board and Transaction Committee as to the fairness\nfrom a financial point of view of the $21.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of\nshares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual\nfuture results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to\nuncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Parent,\nGoldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved by the Board and\nTransaction Committee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any\nspecific amount of consideration to the Company, its Board, or the Transaction Committee, or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the\nonly appropriate consideration for the Merger.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board and Transaction Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board\nand the Transaction Committee in making their respective determinations to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to\nbe a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference\nto the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and\nemployees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any\ntime purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps\nand other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including CD&R and TPG, and any of their\nrespective affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Transactions, including the Merger.

        "Section Text": "Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Discussion Materials Provided to CD&R and TPG\nIn connection with the Transactions, CD&R and TPG engaged Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm, to provide limited financial advisory services to CD&R and TPG. In connection with Deutsche Bank\u2019s engagement, Deutsche\nBank provided to representatives of CD&R and TPG, for informational purposes only, (i) discussion materials dated April 29, 2022 (the \u201cApril 29 DB\nDiscussion Materials\u201d), (ii) discussion materials dated May 5, 2022 (the \u201cMay 5 DB Discussion Materials\u201d), (iii) discussion materials dated May 7, 2022\n(the \u201cMay 7 DB Discussion Materials\u201d) and (iv) discussion materials dated May 13, 2022 (the \u201cMay 13 DB Discussion Materials\u201d and, together with the\nApril 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials, the \u201cDB Discussion Materials\u201d). Copies\nof the DB Discussion Materials have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13e-3 and are incorporated herein by reference. The DB Discussion Materials\nwill be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of the Company during its regular business hours by any interested\nequity security holder of the Company or a representative thereof who has been so designated in writing. The description of the DB Discussion Materials\nset forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such DB Discussion Materials.\nThe DB Discussion Materials were provided for the information of CD&R and TPG in connection with the proposed Transactions and were not provided\nto the Company, the Transaction Committee or the Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and it did\nnot, among other things, (i) assist with any price or other negotiations in connection with the Transactions or otherwise, (ii) render or deliver any\nopinion (whether as to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise) or\n(iii) provide any recommendation as to how to vote or act on any matters relating to the Transactions or otherwise. In addition, the financial analyses\nand observations reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were not analyses or observations with respect to the fairness of any consideration\n(including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise, did not reflect an opinion of Deutsche Bank as to the fairness\nof any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise and should not be viewed as a factor\nconsidered by the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company\u2019s management or otherwise with respect to the fairness of\nany consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Further, the DB Discussion Materials do\nnot constitute a recommendation to the CD&R Entities, TPG, the Board, the Transaction Committee, the Company\u2019s management or otherwise with\nrespect to the fairness of any consideration (including, without limitation, the Merger Consideration), the Transactions or otherwise. Deutsche Bank\nexpressed no view as to, and it did not address, the underlying business decision of any party to the Transactions to effect or enter into the Transactions,\nthe relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for any such party or the effect of any other\ntransaction which any such party might engage in or consider. The DB Discussion Materials were preliminary and informational and are not reflective\nof certain procedures typically applicable to materials or presentations in connection with delivering an opinion.\nWhile the DB Discussion Materials include various analyses and observations (as described below), the CD&R Entities and TPG believe that those\nanalyses and observations were preliminary only and did not take into account all relevant factors\u037e therefore, the CD&R Entities and TPG did not\nconsider such materials in determining an appropriate price for the Company or any of its business divisions, either in connection\n56Table of Contents\nwith the Transactions or in future possible exit scenarios. The CD&R Entities and TPG did not rely on the DB Discussion Materials in negotiating the\nconsideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions or in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement or the\nTransactions. This section and the DB Discussion Materials have nevertheless been provided in response to certain regulations governing Schedule\n13e-3 transactions.\nIn preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify,\nany information, whether publicly available or furnished to, discussed with or reviewed by Deutsche Bank, concerning the Company, its business\ndivisions or any other entity or business, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the preparation of the DB\nDiscussion Materials. Accordingly, for purposes of the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank assumed and relied upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain\nor review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise), of\nthe Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company, its\nbusiness divisions or any other entity or business under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Deutsche Bank expressed no view\nas to any pending or potential litigation, claims or governmental, regulatory or other proceedings or investigations or the potential impact thereof on the\nCompany, its business divisions or any other entity or business, the Transactions or otherwise.\nDeutsche Bank did not have access to or otherwise engage in any communications with the Board, the Transaction Committee, the management of the\nCompany or any of their respective advisors in preparing the DB Discussion Materials. Deutsche Bank relied primarily on the portion of the Financial\nForecasts provided to CD&R and TPG by the Company\u2019s management. Deutsche Bank assumed that the financial and other information prepared or\nprovided by or discussed with CD&R and TPG were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments\nas to the matters covered thereby. Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of any financial forecasts and projections or other\ninformation utilized in its analyses or the assumptions on which they were based or the consideration payable in the Transactions.\nThe DB Discussion Materials did not in any manner address the value of Company common stock or the Company taken as a whole or the prices at\nwhich Company common stock or other securities would trade following the announcement or consummation of the Transactions. Deutsche Bank did not\nexpress any view with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to accounting, tax or other\nconsequences resulting from the proposed Transactions or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and other laws,\nregulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting the Company, its business divisions or any other entity or business or the Transactions.\nThe preliminary financial considerations and other information in the DB Discussion Materials reflected market data proximate to such DB Discussion\nMaterials and were based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances in effect on, and information made available\nto Deutsche Bank as of, the respective dates on which the DB Discussion Materials were prepared, as well as the portion of the Financial Forecasts\nprovided to CD&R and TPG by the Company\u2019s management. Subsequent developments may affect the DB Discussion Materials and Deutsche Bank\nexpressly disclaims any undertaking or obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the DB Discussion Materials or to advise any person of any change in any\nfact or matter affecting the DB Discussion Materials of which Deutsche Bank may become aware after the respective dates of the DB Discussion\nMaterials.\nIn preparing the DB Discussion Materials, Deutsche Bank reviewed a variety of preliminary financial and comparative matters, including those\nsummarized below. Deutsche Bank also considered industry performance, general financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and\ncircumstances existing as of dates\n57\nTable of Contents\nproximate to the DB Discussion Materials, many of which are beyond the control of the CD&R Entities, TPG and the Company.\nThe estimates or results contained in the DB Discussion Materials are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the DB Discussion Materials. In addition, the results of a financial review of\nthe value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or\nacquired. Accordingly, the estimates utilized and results reflected in the DB Discussion Materials were inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nDeutsche Bank was not requested to, and it did not, recommend, determine or otherwise participate in the negotiation of the consideration payable in the\nTransactions. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Transactions were determined through negotiations among the CD&R Entities and\nTPG, on the one hand, and the Company, the Transaction Committee and the Board (other than the Recused Directors), on the other hand, and the\ndecision to enter into the Merger Agreement was that of the parties to the Merger Agreement. The DB Discussion Materials were viewed by the CD&R\nEntities and TPG as having limited relevance and were not relied on by the CD&R Entities or TPG in arriving at the decision to enter into the Merger\nAgreement or the Transactions, and the DB Discussion Materials had no influence on the CD&R Entities\u2019 and TPG\u2019s analysis or negotiation of the\nconsideration payable in the Transactions or any other terms of the Transactions.\nThe summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses and observations performed by Deutsche Bank, nor\ndoes the order of the financial analyses or observations described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses or\nobservations by Deutsche Bank. Certain financial analyses and observations summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand the financial analyses and observations, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary as the tables alone do\nnot constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and observations. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses and observations, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the financial analyses and\nobservations, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses and observations. Future results may be different from those\ndescribed and such differences may be material.\nSummary of the DB Discussion Materials.\nThe April 29 DB Discussion Materials, the May 5 DB Discussion Materials and the May 7 DB Discussion Materials were each prior iterations of the May\n13 DB Discussion Materials and contain the same topics, financial analyses and observations and substantially similar information as those included in\nthe May 13 DB Discussion Materials.

        "Section Text": "Plans for the Company After the Merger\nFollowing completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a\nsubsidiary of Parent. The shares of Company common stock are currently listed on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act. Following\ncompletion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the shares of Company common stock and, as soon as possible following the Effective Time,\nCompany common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, deregistered under the Exchange Act and cease to be publicly traded.\nGiven CD&R VFC Holdings\u2019 long-standing ownership stake in the Company, the CD&R Entities currently anticipate that the Company\u2019s strategy and\noperations will initially be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company\nwill cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent). Following completion of the Merger, the\n67Table of Contents\nCD&R Entities, together with TPG, will continue to assess the Company\u2019s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business,\nproperties and personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable to enhance the business and operations of the Company.\nThe names of the persons expected to become the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time will be added to this proxy\nstatement prior to its mailing. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are expected to be the\nofficers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their\nearlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company.\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our\ndirectors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Covetrus stockholders generally. The\nTransaction Committee and the Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the Merger Agreement and\nrecommended that Covetrus\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition to the matters described below, two directors, Sandra Peterson (an Operating Partner at CD&R) and Ravi Sachdev (a Partner at CD&R), were\ndesignated by CD&R VFC Holdings as directors on the Board (and they recused themselves from deliberations regarding the Merger due to their\naffiliation with CD&R).\nEquity Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the acceleration and cash-out of all outstanding equity awards upon the consummation of the Merger, including\nthose held by our executive officers and directors.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time each outstanding equity award will be treated as follows:\nTreatment of Stock Options.\nOutstanding options to purchase shares of Company common stock (other than rights to purchase shares of Company common stock under the ESPP\n(described below)) (each, an \u201cOption\u201d) granted under the Company\u2019s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, whether vested or unvested, will be\ntreated as follows: (i) if the per share of Company common stock exercise price of such Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such\nOption will terminate and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have\nno further force or effect and (ii) if the per share of Company common stock exercise price of such Option is less than the Merger Consideration, such\nOption will terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash\npayment in the amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nmultiplied by (y) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price (the product of (x) and (y), the \u201cOption Payment\u201d).\nFrom and after the Effective Time, each Option will no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but will only entitle such holder to the Option\nPayment, if any. The Option Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar\ndays thereafter), net of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nTreatment of Restricted Stock Units.\nOutstanding restricted stock units that are subject to time-based vesting conditions (a \u201cRestricted Stock Unit\u201d or \u201cRSU\u201d), granted under the Company\u2019s\n2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan that are outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested will\nfully vest (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Restricted Stock Unit would not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be\n68\nTable of Contents\nautomatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to\n(i) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the product of (i)\nand (ii), the \u201cRestricted Stock Unit Payment\u201d). From and after the Effective Time, no Restricted Stock Unit will remain outstanding and each former holder\nof any such Restricted Stock Unit will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment. The\nRestricted Stock Unit Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days\nthereafter), net of any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nTreatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units.\nOutstanding performance restricted stock units that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a \u201cPerformance Restricted Stock Unit\u201d or\n\u201cPRSU\u201d) granted under the Company\u2019s 2019 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan that are outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the\nEffective Time, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Performance Restricted Stock Unit\nwould not otherwise vest) and will terminate and be automatically cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to\nreceive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Performance Restricted\nStock Unit that would vest based on the target level of achievement (provided that in no event will such number of shares of Company common stock\nexceed 990,000), multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (the product of (i) and (ii), the \u201cPerformance Restricted Stock Unit Payment\u201d). From and after\nthe Effective Time, no Performance Restricted Stock Unit will remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Performance Restricted Stock Unit\nwill cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Performance Restricted Stock Unit Payment. The Performance Restricted\nStock Unit Payment will be made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), net\nof any taxes withheld pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nTreatment of Company Restricted Stock.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of Company common stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time will fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive Merger Consideration and be treated in the same\nmanner as all other shares of Company common stock for such purposes.\nTreatment of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe Company has agreed to take all actions necessary to terminate the ESPP and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately prior to the\nEffective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d). The offering or purchase period under the ESPP that would\nbe in effect as of the Effective Time (the \u201cFinal Offering Period\u201d) will terminate no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the\nCompany has agreed to cause the exercise date applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on the termination date of the ESPP with\nrespect to any then-outstanding purchase rights. All amounts allocated to each participant\u2019s account under the ESPP at the end of the Final Offering\nPeriod will thereupon be used to purchase whole shares of Company common stock under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares of\nCompany common stock will be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as all\nother shares of Company common stock. Following the purchase of the shares of Company common stock, the Company will return to each participant\nthe funds, if any, that remain in such participant\u2019s account after such purchase. The Company has agreed to take such steps as may be necessary such\nthat, between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the Closing, (i) no new participants may commence participation in the ESPP, (ii) no\ncurrent participant in the ESPP may increase his or her rate of contribution under the ESPP and (iii) no new offering period will commence after the date the\nMerger Agreement was signed.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the number of shares of Company common stock underlying outstanding RSUs, PRSUs and Options that would be held by\nour executive officers as of September 15, 2022 assuming the Merger closes on such date (solely for the purposes of the table below) (taking into account\nany vesting of their outstanding awards that occurs prior to such date) and the cash proceeds that such awards will be converted into in connection with\nthe Merger, assuming a price per share of $21.00, which is the price per share of Company common stock to be paid in connection with the Merger.

For Dustin Finer, Georgina Wraight, Matthew Malenfant and Matthew\nFoulston, such period commences two months prior (or the earlier date of execution of a definitive agreement to effectuate a change in control) and ends\n12 months following the consummation of the change in control.\nFor each named executive officer, assuming their employment was terminated as a Qualifying Termination, the total severance payments would be as\nfollows: (i) for Benjamin Wolin, a lump sum payment equal to eighteen (18) months of base salary in the amount of $1,575,000 plus his target pro-rated\nannual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $656,250 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $45,980\u037e (ii) for Matthew\nFoulston, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $600,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments\nover the twelve (12) month\n70\nTable of Contents\nperiod following the termination in the amount of $540,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $32,667\u037e (iii) for\nMatthew Malenfant, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $575,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 payable in equal\ninstallments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $460,000 and eighteen (18) months of COBRA insurance\ncoverage in the amount of $47,108\u037e (iv) for Georgina Wraight, twelve (12) months of base salary continuation in the amount of $550,000 plus her target\nannual bonus for 2022 payable in equal installments over the twelve (12) month period following the termination in the amount of $412,500 and twelve (12)\nmonths of COBRA insurance coverage in the amount of $31,813\u037e and (v) for Dustin Finer, a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of base salary\nin the amount of $480,000 plus his target annual bonus for 2022 in the amount of $360,000 and twelve (12) months of COBRA insurance coverage in the\namount of $31,813.\nIn addition, upon a Qualifying Termination, all equity awards held by the executive officers that are subject to time-based vesting would become fully\nvested, and any equity awards that are subject to performance-based vesting will vest based on the \u201ctarget\u201d level of performance (for Benjamin Wolin) or\nbased on the greater of \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d performance at the time of termination (for Georgina Wraight, Matthew Foulston, Matthew Malenfant and\nDustin Finer) in accordance with the relevant award agreements.\nOn August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the \u201cFoulston Amendment\u201d) to Mr. Foulston\u2019s employment agreement, dated as of May 11,\n2020, in order to retain Mr. Foulston\u2019s services through December 31, 2022 (the \u201cExpiration Date\u201d). The Foulston Amendment provides for, among other\nterms: (i) the vesting of outstanding equity grants held by Mr. Foulston on the earlier of the Expiration Date and the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) the payment of Mr. Foulston\u2019s annual bonus at an amount equal to the greater of Mr. Foulston\u2019s 2022 target\nbonus and the amount earned based on the actual achievement of performance goals under the Company\u2019s 2022 annual bonus plan\u037e (iii) severance of\n$2,020,000 paid over twelve months following the Expiration Date\u037e (iv) eighteen-months COBRA continuation\u037e and (v) the payment of his base salary\nthrough the Expiration Date if his employment is terminated prior to the Expiration Date. In the event that Mr. Foulston\u2019s employment is terminated prior\nto the Expiration Date, either by the Company without \u201ccause,\u201d by Mr. Foulston for \u201cgood reason\u201d or by reason of death or \u201cdisability\u201d (each as defined\nin the Foulston Amendment), Mr. Foulston will continue to be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, as well as payment of his base\nsalary and provision of health benefits through the Expiration Date.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to Mr. Finer\u2019s employment agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, in order to clarify that\nMr. Finer will continue to be an employee of the Company on unpaid leave from August 16, 2022 through the earlier of the consummation of the Merger\nand December 31, 2022 (at which time his employment will terminate) and that Mr. Finer, will be entitled to receive certain benefits upon the consummation\nof the Merger, including the vesting of all vested and unvested outstanding equity grants.\nNew Management Arrangements\nIt is expected that the Company and CD&R and TPG will work together to develop a new long-term incentive plan for the Company to be implemented\nfollowing the closing, and representatives of CD&R and TPG have held and may hold further preliminary discussions with certain members of the\nCompany\u2019s management team regarding employment with, and the right to purchase (including by reinvesting all or a portion of their existing equity in\nthe Company) or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. However, as of the date of this proxy statement, neither the Company\nnor Parent or any of its affiliates has entered into any agreements, arrangements or understandings with the Company\u2019s executive officers with respect to\nthe foregoing, and there can be no assurances that the terms of any such agreements, arrangements or understandings will be agreed upon with any\nexecutive officers in the future. If Parent or its affiliates and the Company\u2019s executive officers do not enter into agreements regarding employment with\nParent or its affiliates, then the Company\u2019s executive officers will remain subject to their existing arrangements with the Company.\n71\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Header": "Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger\nOur directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company\ncommon stock owned directly by them in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Merger-Related Compensation\nProposal. As of September 7, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 872,688\nshares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, or collectively approximately 0.6% of all the outstanding shares of Company\ncommon stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\nThe Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and\nhold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, determined as of the Effective Time (the\n\u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines, losses,\nclaims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,\nadministrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger Agreement\nand the Transactions)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or\nis or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person prior to the Effective Time, in each case,\nwhether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company\nwould have been permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such person is a party, the\nCompany\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person (and Parent and the Surviving\nCorporation will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law\u037e provided that the person to whom expenses are\nadvanced will provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to\nindemnification). Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, will, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable, in the aggregate, with respect to\nindemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents\nof any subsidiary). The right of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise\nmodified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party.\nPrior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to,\nobtain and fully pay for \u201ctail\u201d insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier\nwith the same or better credit rating as the Company\u2019s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary\nliability insurance (collectively, \u201cD&O Insurance\u201d) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing policies with\nrespect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions)\u037e\nprovided, however that in no event will the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium in excess of three- hundred percent\n(300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such \u201ctail\u201d insurance\npolicies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a\nperiod of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with benefits and\nlevels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Company\u2019s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or the\nSurviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period\n73Table of Contents\nwith benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company\u2019s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nprovided, however that in no event will the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual\npremium amount in excess of three- hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance\u037e and, provided,\nfurther that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage\navailable for a cost not exceeding such amount.\nCertain Effects of the Merger\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved by the Company stockholders, and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or\n(to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Covetrus upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nAs the Surviving Corporation, Covetrus will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nFollowing the Merger, all of Covetrus\u2019 equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Parent, and none of Covetrus\u2019 current stockholders will,\nby virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the surviving corporation or Parent after the completion of the Merger\n(except CD&R VFC Holdings will have an indirect ownership interest in Covetrus as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Support and\nRollover Agreement). As a result, Covetrus\u2019 current stockholders (other than CD&R VFC Holdings) will no longer benefit from any increase in the value,\nnor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Company common stock. Following the Merger, Parent will benefit from any increase in\nCovetrus\u2019 enterprise value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Covetrus\u2019 enterprise value.\nFor information regarding the effects of the Merger on Covetrus\u2019 outstanding equity awards, see the sections entitled \u201cSpecial Factors\u2014Interests of\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 68, and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\u037e\nCompany ESPP,\u201d beginning on page 86.\nCompany common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCVET.\u201d Following the completion of\nthe Merger, the shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on NASDAQ or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the\nshares of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Covetrus will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports\nwith the SEC with respect to Company common stock. Termination of registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the\ninformation required to be furnished by Covetrus to Covetrus\u2019 stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such\nas the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of\nSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders\u2019 meetings pursuant to Section 14(a)\nof the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Covetrus to the extent that they apply solely as a result of the registration of Company common stock under\nthe Exchange Act.\nThe primary detriments of the Merger to stockholders unaffiliated with Parent, CD&R and TPG include the lack of an interest of such stockholders in the\npotential future earnings, growth or value realized by the Company after the Merger.\nConsequences if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not\nreceive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your shares of Company common stock. Instead, Covetrus will remain a public company, and the\nCompany common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar\nto that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Company common stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and\nopportunities as they currently are subject to with\n74\nTable of Contents\nrespect to their ownership of Company common stock. If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of Company common stock, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to the extent\nthat the current market price of Company common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement\nProposal is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any\nother transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, (i) Covetrus may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$88,315,000 or (ii) Parent may be required to pay Covetrus a termination fee of $197,950,000. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees,\u201d beginning on page 110.\nYou should also read and consider carefully the other information in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this proxy statement and the documents\nincorporated by reference herein, including the risk factors contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. See the\nsection entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the disposition of Company common stock for cash in the Merger\nto \u201cU.S. Holders\u201d (as defined below). This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal\nincome taxation that might be relevant to U.S. Holders. This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), existing, proposed and temporary regulations thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in\neffect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service\n(which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be\ngiven that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS.\nThe summary applies only to U.S Holders in whose hands shares of Company common stock are capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode. This summary does not address foreign, state or local tax consequences of the Merger, nor does it address the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the transactions to special classes of taxpayers (e.g., stockholders that beneficially own (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the\ntotal fair market value of the shares of Company common stock, small business investment companies, S corporations, regulated investment companies,\nreal estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, qualified foreign pension funds or qualified\ncollective investment vehicles, persons that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, cooperatives, banks and certain other financial\ninstitutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, governmental organizations, retirement plans, stockholders that are, or hold\nshares of Company common stock through, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, stockholders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders that mark-to-market\ntheir securities, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, stockholders holding shares of Company common stock that are part of a\nstraddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated security transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, stockholders who properly\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Company common stock, stockholders who hold their shares of Company common stock as\n\u201cqualified small business stock\u201d or \u201csection 1244 stock,\u201d stockholders who received shares of Company common stock in compensatory transactions\n(including pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights, as restricted stock or otherwise as\ncompensation), stockholders who are not exchanging shares of Covetrus shares for cash, and stockholders who\n75\nTable of Contents\nactually or constructively own an interest in Parent). In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (including any\nU.S. federal estate or gift tax consequences), or any aspect of the U.S. alternative minimum tax or Medicare tax on net investment income.\nIf a partnership, or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of the Company common\nstock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the\npartnership\u2019s activities. Accordingly, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold shares of\nCompany common stock, and partners or members in those entities, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to them of the Merger.\nThis discussion does not address the tax consequences of acquisitions or dispositions of shares of Company common stock outside the Merger, or\ntransactions pertaining to options or other equity awards of the Company in connection with the Merger.\nFor purposes of this summary, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, is or is treated as: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e (ii) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e (iii) an estate, the\nincome of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or (iv) a trust, if (A) a United States court is able to exercise primary\nsupervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have authority\nto control all of the trust\u2019s substantial decisions or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S.\nHOLDERS. WE URGE U.S. HOLDERS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO\nTHE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT\nAND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER APPLICABLE U.S. TAX TREATIES AND STATE, LOCAL\nOR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.\nTax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S.\nHolders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of\ncash received and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or\nloss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (that is, shares of Company common stock acquired at the same\ncost in a single transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss would be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the\nholding period for such block of shares of Company common stock is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital\ngains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital\nlosses by a U.S. Holder is subject to certain limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds received by a holder\npursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies\nunder penalty of perjury that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form).

by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach by the\nCompany in any material respect of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and that the Board (acting on the recommendation of the\nTransaction Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior

Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period, to consider any adjustments\nproposed in writing by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement\nceases to constitute a Superior Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial\nadvisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing\nby Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation\nor to so terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties\nunder applicable law.\nIntervening Event Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision\nNotwithstanding anything to the

inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Board (acting on the recommendation of the Transaction Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its\noutside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, the\nfailure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law.\n\u201cIntervening Event\u201d means a material effect that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the execution of the Merger\nAgreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which

None of the parties, including their respective subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, will take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit\nto take, any action which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the contemplated transactions, unless\notherwise agreed to by the parties.\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, neither CD&R nor TPG (solely with respect to the TPG\nCapital platform) will directly or indirectly (but subject in all respects to the immediately succeeding sentence) acquire or agree to acquire by merger or\nconsolidation with, or by purchasing the assets of or equity in, any person, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation\nof such a transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay past the Termination Date (as defined below) the satisfaction of the governmental\nconsent condition to Closing.

communication or inquiry, such party will provide the other party and its counsel a\nreasonable opportunity to review, and will consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,\ncommunication or inquiry\u037e\n\u2022\npromptly following the submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any

investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any governmental\nentity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any governmental entity relating\nthereto.\nParent, including its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any\ngovernmental entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable antitrust laws or laws relating to foreign investment with respect to the\nTransactions and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in\nany suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the Transactions.\nIf any administrative or judicial proceeding, including any such proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the\nMerger or any other Transaction as violative of any antitrust law or laws relating to foreign investment, each of the Company and Parent will use its\nreasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,\ninjunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the\nMerger.\nHowever, the Merger Agreement also provides that notwithstanding any of the obligations with respect to efforts relating to antitrust laws and laws\nrelating to foreign investment described above or any other provisions of the Merger Agreement, nothing in the Merger Agreement will require Merger\nSub, Parent or any of their affiliates (including CD&R and TPG or any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by,\nCD&R or TPG or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of CD&R, TPG or of any\nsuch investment fund or investment vehicle) to, and the Company will not, without the prior written consent of

information concerning its or any of its subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock,\nbusiness and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Merger\u037e provided, that no investigation will affect or be\n99\nTable of Contents\ndeemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Covetrus\u037e and provided further, that the foregoing will not require Covetrus to permit any\ninvasive environmental sampling or any inspection or to disclose any information, to the extent that (A) in the reasonable good faith judgment of\nCovetrus\u2019 outside legal counsel, any applicable law requires Covetrus or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information or\ndisclosure thereof would expose Covetrus to an unreasonable risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive personal information, (B) in the reasonable good\nfaith judgment of Covetrus, the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or its disclosure would violate the terms of any\nconfidentiality agreement or other contract that is binding on Covetrus or any of its subsidiaries, or (C) disclosure of any such information or document\nwould result in the waiver or loss of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other legal privilege\u037e provided further, that with respect to the\nforegoing clauses (A) through (C), Covetrus will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to\nprovide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Covetrus\nand (3) in the case of clauses (A) and (C), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a\nmanner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary)\nor entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would\nreasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to the\nforgoing right of access will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. All\nrequests for information made pursuant to the foregoing right of access will be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such person as may be\ndesignated by any such executive officer.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\nThe Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and\nhold harmless the Indemnified Parties against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees),\njudgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether\ncivil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger\nAgreement and the Transactions)), arising out of or based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the\nCompany, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person prior to the Effective Time, in each\ncase, whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the\nCompany would have been permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such person is a party,\nthe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person (and Parent and the\nSurviving Corporation will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law\u037e provided that the person to whom\nexpenses are advanced will provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not\nentitled to indemnification).

damage would occur and that the parties would not have any\nadequate remedy at law in the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties to the Merger Agreement were not\nperformed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate\nremedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will be entitled to seek an injunction or\ninjunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions\nof the Merger Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other\nsecurity therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party has agreed that it will not\noppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or\nthat any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the\nforegoing, the parties have further acknowledged and agreed that prior to the Closing, the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance to\nenforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub\nunder the Merger Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company\u2019s right to\nterminate the Merger Agreement and seek money damages (including\n111\nTable of Contents\ndamages based on loss of the expected economic benefits of the transaction to the Company).

Under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as \u201cSection 262\u201d), holders of shares of Company common stock with respect to which\nappraisal rights are properly demanded and perfected and not withdrawn or lost are entitled, in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration, to have the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of their shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) at the Effective Time\njudicially determined and paid to them in cash by complying with the provisions of Section 262. Covetrus is required to send a notice to that effect to\neach stockholder not less than 20 days prior to the special meeting. This proxy statement constitutes that notice to the record holders of Company\ncommon stock.\nThe following is a brief summary of Section 262, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not\na complete statement of the applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached to\nthis proxy statement as Annex D. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in\nAnnex D. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 may result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL. If you\nhold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult\nwith your bank, broker or the other nominee. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a\nrecommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\nStockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must do ALL of the following: (i) not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement, (ii) deliver in the manner set forth below a written demand for appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares of Company common stock to the\nSecretary of Covetrus before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting, (iii) continuously hold the shares of record from\nthe date of making the demand through completion of the Merger and (iv) otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262.\nOnly a holder of record of Company common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for\nappraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder\u2019s name as it appears on\nthe certificates representing shares. If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must\nbe executed by the fiduciary. If shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal\nfor a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose that, in exercising the demand, the agent is acting\nas agent for the record owner or owners.\nA record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as a nominee for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less\nthan all beneficial owners of shares as to which the holder is the record owner. In that case, the written demand must set forth the number of shares\ncovered by the demand. Where the number of shares is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares outstanding in the name of\nthe record owner.\nBeneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record owner to determine the\nappropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with respect to the beneficial owner\u2019s shares. Any holder of shares held\nin \u201cstreet name\u201d who desires appraisal rights with respect to those shares must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper\ndemand for appraisal is made by the record owner of the shares.\n127Table of Contents\nShares of Company common stock held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record\nin the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust Company\u2019s nominee. A demand for appraisal with\nrespect to such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and it must identify the depository nominee as the record owner. Any\nbeneficial holder of shares desiring appraisal rights with respect to such shares which are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial\ninstitution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder.\nAs required by Section 262, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Covetrus of the identity of the record holder (which\nmight be a nominee as described above) and of such holder\u2019s intention to seek appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares.\nStockholders of record who elect to demand appraisal of their shares must mail or deliver their written demand to:\nCovetrus, Inc.\n7 Custom House Street, Portland, ME 04101\nAttention: Margaret Pritchard, Interim General Counsel and Secretary\nThe written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder\u2019s name and mailing address. The written demand must reasonably inform Covetrus that\nthe stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of his, her or its shares. The written demand must be received by Covetrus prior to the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting. Neither voting (via the virtual meeting website or by proxy) against, abstaining from voting\non or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will alone suffice to constitute a written demand for appraisal within the meaning of\nSection 262. In addition, the stockholder must not vote its shares of Company common stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. An executed\nproxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and will cause the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal to be lost. Therefore, a stockholder who desires to exercise appraisal rights should either (x) refrain from executing and\nsubmitting the enclosed proxy card or (y) vote by proxy against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or affirmatively register an abstention with\nrespect thereto.\nWithin 120 days after completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who has timely and properly\ndemanded appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares and who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,\nor any beneficial owner for which a demand for appraisal has been properly made by the record holder, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a\npetition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares of all stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Covetrus\nas the Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the Surviving\nCorporation will file such a petition or that the Surviving Corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares.\nAccordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights\nwithin the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.\nWithin 120 days after completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon\nrequest given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the\nnotice of appraisal), to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock not\nvoting in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and the number of holders of\nsuch shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of\n128\nTable of Contents\nshares held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from the Surviving\nCorporation for the statement described in the previous sentence. Such statement must be given within 10 days after the request therefor has been\nreceived by the Surviving Corporation.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a Covetrus stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, then the Surviving\nCorporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified\nlist containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares of Company common stock have not been reached. After notice to stockholders who have demanded appraisal,\nif such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine\nthose stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require\nthe stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to\nthe Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. The Delaware Court of Chancery must dismiss an appraisal\nproceeding as to all Covetrus stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\noutstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares\nseeking appraisal exceeds $1,000,000, or (iii) the Merger was approved pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL. Where proceedings are not\ndismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted, as to the shares of Company common stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the\nrules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.\nAfter a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and thereafter will\nappraise the shares owned by those stockholders, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the\nDelaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in subsection (h) of Section 262,\ninterest from the date the Merger is completed through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharges) as established from time to time during the period between the date the Merger is completed\nand the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the combined company may pay to each former\nCovetrus stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 only upon the sum\nof (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)\ninterests theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered in an appraisal proceeding and that \u201c[f]air\nprice obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making\nthis determination of fair value the court may consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any\nother facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262\nprovides that fair value is to be determined \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of\nproof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\n129\nTable of Contents\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could be more than, the\nsame as, or less than the Merger Consideration they are entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek appraisal of their\nshares, and that opinions of investment banking firms as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction are\nnot opinions as to fair value under Section 262. Covetrus reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Company common stock is less than the applicable Merger Consideration.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. The Delaware Court of Chancery may\norder that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by such stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of\nsuch a determination of assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nFrom and after the date of completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after\ncompletion of the Merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to completion of the Merger.\nWithin 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger became effective to each of Covetrus\u2019\nstockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262. At any time within 60 days after\ncompletion of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded appraisal and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the cash to which the stockholder is entitled\npursuant to the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal only with the written approval of the\nSurviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after completion of the Merger,\nstockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal will cease and all stockholders will be entitled only to receive the Merger Consideration as provided for in the Merger\nAgreement. No petition timely filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal will be dismissed as to any stockholders without the approval\nof the Delaware Court of Chancery, and that approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. However, the\npreceding sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding as a named\nparty to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after completion of the\nMerger.\nThe foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a\ncomplete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached as\nAnnex D to this proxy statement.\nFailure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your\nappraisal rights.\n130\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND DATA\nCompany common stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCVET.\u201d\nAs of the close of business on September 7, 2022, the record date, there were 140,122,753 shares of Company common stock outstanding and entitled to\nvote, held by approximately 442 holders of record of the shares of Company common stock. Because many of the shares of Company common stock are\nheld by brokers and other institutions on behalf of Company stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by\nthese record holders.\nThe closing price of Company common stock on NASDAQ on May 19, 2022, the last trading day prior to the day CD&R publicly disclosed the proposal\nletter in an amendment to its Schedule 13D filings with respect to the Company, was $18.02, and on May 24, 2022, the last trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, was $19.66 per share of Company common stock. On September 9, 2022, the most recent\npracticable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for the shares of Company common stock on NASDAQ was\n$20.90 per share.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales price of shares of Company common stock on the NASDAQ.\nFiscal Year\nHigh\nLow\nDividend\nPaid\n2020\nFirst Quarter\n$15.59\n$ 4.05\n\u2014\nSecond Quarter\n$19.52\n$ 6.26\n\u2014\nThird Quarter\n$25.52\n$16.97\n\u2014\nFourth Quarter\n$32.17\n$22.94\n\u2014\n2021\nFirst Quarter\n$40.78\n$27.50\n\u2014\nSecond Quarter\n$31.24\n$24.65\nThird Quarter\n$27.30\n$18.08\n\u2014\nFourth Quarter\n$21.00\n$16.52\n\u2014\n2022\nFirst Quarter\n$20.22\n$15.56\n\u2014\nSecond Quarter\n$21.20\n$13.39\n\u2014\nIf the Merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, will be deregistered under the Exchange Act and will cease to be\npublicly traded.\nYou are encouraged to obtain current market prices of the shares of Company common stock in connection with voting your shares of Company common\nstock. Following the Merger, there will be no further market for Company common stock, and Company common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and\nderegistered under the Exchange Act.\nCovetrus has not historically paid dividends on its common stock, and under the terms of the Merger Agreement, prior to the Closing (or the earlier\ntermination of the Merger Agreement), Covetrus is prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividend or other distribution on the shares of Company\ncommon stock without Parent\u2019s written consent.\n131Table of Contents",
