        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL\nMEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting, the merger\nand the merger agreement. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you. You should read the more\ndetailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or\nincorporated by reference in this proxy statement.\n \nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\n \nA:\nOn December 11, 2022, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of\nParent.\nYou are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in favor of the merger agreement proposal\nand the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting described below under \u201c\u2014What proposals will be considered at the special\nmeeting?\u201d \n \nQ:\nAs a holder of Company common stock, what will I receive in the merger?\n \nA:\nIf the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $81.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes,\nfor each share of Company common stock that you own immediately prior to the effective time.\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more detailed description of the\nUnited States federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of how the\nmerger will affect your federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. taxes.\n \nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting of our stockholders?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting of Company stockholders will be held on February 23, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time, in a virtual-only meeting format. We\nare conducting the special meeting in a virtual-only format, so our stockholders can participate from any geographic location with Internet\nconnectivity. We believe this enhances accessibility to the special meeting for all of our stockholders and reduces the carbon footprint of our\nactivities. We have worked to offer the same rights and opportunities to participate as would be provided at an in-person meeting, while\nproviding an online experience available to all stockholders regardless of their location. Company stockholders will not be able to physically\nattend the special meeting. You must register to attend the meeting prior to the start of the meeting.

Once you have registered for the meeting, you will receive an email\nconfirmation containing additional information regarding the virtual special meeting. We encourage you to access the special meeting before\nthe start time of 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Please allow ample time to log into the audio webcast and test your computer systems.\n \nQ:\nWho is entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nOnly Company stockholders of record at the close of business on January 23, 2023, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to\nnotice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any postponement or\n \n \n16\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents\nadjournment thereof. As of the close of business on January 19, 2023, the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement, there\nwere 75,541,300 shares of Company common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each Company stockholder is entitled to one vote per\nshare of Company common stock held by such Company stockholder on the record date on each of the proposals presented in this proxy\nstatement.\nIf on January 23, 2023, you were a \u201crecord\u201d holder of Company common stock (that is, if you held Company common stock in your own name\nin the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cComputershare\u201d)), you are entitled to attend and\nvote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you intend to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to authorize\na proxy to vote now, online, by phone or by mailing a proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted.\nIf on January 23, 2023, you were the beneficial owner of Company common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d (that is, if you held Company common\nstock through your bank, broker or other nominee), then these materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. You may direct your\nbank, broker or other nominee how to vote your Company common stock by following the voting instructions on the enclosed form provided\nby your bank, broker or other nominee. If you hold any Company common stock through your bank, broker or other nominee and wish to\nattend the virtual special meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting but may not be able to vote unless you first obtain a legal proxy\nissued in your name from such broker, bank or other nominee. Once you have received a legal proxy issued in your name from your bank,\nbroker or other nominee, please email a scan or image of it to the Inspector of Elections for the special meeting, Mediant Communications Inc.\n(\u201cMediant\u201d), at DSMsupport@mediant.com with \u201cLegal Proxy\u201d noted in the subject line.\nFor additional information on how to vote at the special meeting, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\n\u2014Voting Procedures\u201d. \nAt the virtual special meeting and for 10 days prior to the special meeting, the names of Company stockholders entitled to vote at the special\nmeeting will be available for inspection for any purpose germane to the meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, at\nthe Company\u2019s principal executive offices located at 1855 S. Grant Street, San Mateo, CA 94402, by contacting the Corporate Secretary of the\nCompany.\n \nQ:\nWhat proposals will be considered at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nAt the special meeting, Company stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n \n\u2022\nthe merger agreement proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe advisory compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe adjournment proposal.\n \nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\n \nA:\nThe Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger agreement proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the merger agreement proposal, please\nsee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u201d. \nIn addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of the\nCompany\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\nstockholders generally. Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger\u201d. \n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n17\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe holders of a majority of all of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or\nrepresented by proxy, constitutes a quorum of Company stockholders for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Virtual attendance\nat the special meeting constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares\npresent for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted as shares present for purposes of\ndetermining the presence of a quorum unless your bank, broker or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the proposals\npresented in this proxy statement. If a quorum is not present or represented at the special meeting of the Company stockholders, the Chair of\nthe Board or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, without notice, if the\ntime and place of the new meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which Company stockholders and proxy holders may be\ndeemed to be present and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the special meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If,\nhowever, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, we will\nprovide a notice of the adjourned meeting to each Company stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting. In the event that a\nquorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting,\nthe special meeting may be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\n \nA:\nThe approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding\nshares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required\nvote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to\napprove the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa. Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to\nauthorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder\u2019s behalf) and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nagreement proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on\nsuch proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to\nauthorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder\u2019s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory\ncompensation proposal.\nThe approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal\nat the special meeting. Abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company stockholder\u2019s behalf) and\nbroker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal, regardless of whether a quorum is present at the special\nmeeting. The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger agreement proposal is approved at the special meeting.\nA broker \u201cnon-vote\u201d occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal\nbecause the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owner, but does have discretionary voting power over other \u201croutine\u201d items and submits votes for those matters. The Company\ndoes not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide\nsuch organization with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine\u201d, whereas each of the proposals to be\npresented at the special meeting is considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be permitted to vote your\nshares of Company common stock at the special meeting without receiving instructions.\n \n \n18\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow do the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\n \nA:\nPursuant to the voting agreement, the Company\u2019s directors, solely in their capacity as stockholders of the Company, have agreed, among other\nthings and subject to certain conditions, to vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and\ncertain other matters. A fuller discussion may be found in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Voting Agreement\u201d. As of January\n19, 2023, the directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-director executive officers who are not party to the voting\nagreement, beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,584,775 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 2.1% of the outstanding shares\nof Company common stock as of January 19, 2023. We currently expect that all directors and executive officers of the Company, including non-\ndirector executive officers who are not party to the voting agreement, will vote their shares of Company common stock \u201cFOR\u201d each of the\nproposals to be presented at the special meeting. For more information regarding the voting agreement and security ownership of directors and\nexecutive officers of the Company, see the sections of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Voting Agreement\u201d and \u201cSecurity Ownership of\nCertain Beneficial Owners and Management\u201d.\n \nQ:\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, my\ninterests as a Company stockholder?\n \nA:\nIn considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting of Company stockholders, you should be aware that the Company\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a Company\nstockholder. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to authorize and approve\nthe execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and to recommend that Company stockholders approve the merger agreement\nproposal. These interests may include:\n \n\u2022\nthe treatment of Company equity awards, including those held by an executive officer or director, and the Company ESPP, in\nwhich executive officers participate, provided for under the merger agreement (as described below in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nTreatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Company ESPP\u201d)\u037e\n \n\u2022\neligibility of our executive officers to receive severance and other benefits payable in the case of certain qualifying terminations of\nemployment under the terms of individual severance and change in control agreements\u037e and\n \n\u2022\ncontinued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the organizational documents of the Company\nand its subsidiaries and indemnification agreements the Company and any of its subsidiaries has entered into with each of its\ndirectors and executive officers.\nThese interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d. \n \nQ:\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the merger?\n \nA:\nEach Company equity award will be treated as follows:\n \n\u2022\neach Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, vested (including any Company Option that vests automatically solely as a\nresult of the merger) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such vested\nCompany Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share\nexercise price of such vested Company Option, except that any\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n19\nTable of Contents\nvested Company Option with a per share price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective\ntime, be canceled for no consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will\nbe canceled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company\ncommon stock for which such unvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the\nmerger consideration over the per share exercise price of such unvested Company Option, which cash amount will continue to\nvest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the replaced Company Option, subject to the holder\u2019s\ncontinued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries), except that any\nCompany Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective\ntime, be canceled for no consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and vested (including any Company RSU that vests automatically solely as a\nresult of the merger) and a portion of certain Company RSUs that would have vested on or prior to January 31, 2024 (as described\nbelow under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d), in each case, outstanding as of immediately prior\nto the effective time, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number\nof shares of Company common stock subject to such vested or deemed vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the\neffective time, multiplied by the merger consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach Company RSU that remains unexpired, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than\nany deemed vested Company RSU) will be canceled and replaced with an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of\nshares of Company common stock subject to such unvested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time,\nmultiplied by the merger consideration, which cash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions\nas applied to the replaced unvested Company RSU, subject to the holder\u2019s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates\n(including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries)\u037e and\n \n\u2022\neach Company PSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (or as otherwise\ndescribed below under The Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d), will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such\nCompany PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time (with such number of shares generally determined by deeming the\napplicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of target performance and actual performance, with actual performance\ndetermined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), multiplied by the merger consideration, except that\neach Company PSU granted to the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer on July 28, 2022. will be canceled in exchange for no\nconsideration in accordance with its terms.\nWith respect to the awards described above, the payments described above will be made subject to any applicable withholding taxes.\nPayments in respect of vested or deemed vested Company equity awards described above will be made promptly following the effective time\n(and in no event later than the first payroll date that occurs more than five business days following the effective time). Payments in respect of\ncash replacement amounts described above will be made no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that occurs more than five\nbusiness days following the date on which such amount vests.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Treatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d. \n \nQ:\nWhat will happen to my participation in the Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan?\n \nA:\nIf the effective time occurs prior to the end of any outstanding offering period in existence under the Company ESPP as of December 11, 2022,\nall outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP will\n \n \n20\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nautomatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, no later than five business days prior to the effective time and\nthe Company ESPP will terminate at such time. Each share of Company common stock purchased on the final exercise date will be canceled at\nthe effective time and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in the same manner as other Company stockholders (less\napplicable tax withholding).\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if I transfer my Company common stock before the special meeting?\n \nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own Company common stock on the record date\nand transfer your shares after the record date but prior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of Company\ncommon stock at the special meeting. However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred\nyour shares of Company common stock.\n \nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a Company stockholder of record or hold my shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\n \nA:\nIf you are a Company stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the special meeting by completing, signing,\ndating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided or by granting your proxy electronically over the internet or\nby telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting and\nvoting during the live webcast.\nIf your shares of Company common stock are held in a stock brokerage account by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the\nbeneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee\nthat is considered the Company stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker\nor other nominee on how to vote your shares via the internet or by phone if the bank, broker or other nominee offers these options to you or\nby completing, dating, signing and returning a voting instruction form by mail. Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you instructions\non how to submit your voting instructions for your shares of Company common stock. To vote at the virtual special meeting, which will have\nthe same effect as revoking any previously submitted voting instructions, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other\nnominee and register in advance. Please see \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Registering for the Special Meeting\u201d for information on how to register\nin advance.\nFor more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special\nMeeting\u2014Voting Procedures\u201d. \nWhether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend\nthe virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you have already voted by proxy.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\n \nA:\nThe approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of outstanding\nshares of Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter. If you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual\nspecial meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, the effect will be that the shares of Company common\nstock that you own will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger agreement proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nagreement proposal.\nThe approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by\nproxy) of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or\nvote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n21\nTable of Contents\ninstruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote, it will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will not be\nconsidered votes cast and therefore, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory compensation proposal\nor the adjournment proposal.\n \nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?\n \nA:\nYes. For the Company stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy and before the proxy is exercised, you may revoke or\nchange your vote in one of four ways:\n \n\u2022\nyou may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) in accordance with the\ninstructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u2014Voting Procedures\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nyou may submit a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy\u037e\n \n\u2022\nyou may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company\u2019s Corporate Secretary at Coupa Software Incorporated, 1855 S.\nGrant Street, San Mateo, CA 94402\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nyou may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in\nitself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.\nPlease note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should\nensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the\nspecial meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker, bank or other nominee and in\naccordance with its procedures. If your broker, bank or other nominee allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by telephone, you may\nbe able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or by mail).

For example, if you hold your Company common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting\ninstruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold Company common stock.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of their ongoing review of the Company\u2019s business, the Board and the Company\u2019s management periodically review and evaluate the\nCompany\u2019s business and long-term strategy, competitive position, historical performance, future prospects and opportunities to increase\nstockholder value. These reviews have included discussions as to whether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a standalone\ncompany, pursue various buy-side acquisitions or pursue a sale of the Company. As part of these reviews, the Board and Company management\nhave considered from time to time potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value along with the potential benefits and risks of such\nalternatives, and have periodically discussed such potential alternatives with Qatalyst Partners, the Company\u2019s historic financial advisor. In addition,\nat least since going public in 2016, the Company has routinely received requests for and had meetings with both strategic parties and financial\nsponsors to discuss developments in the software industry and/or to express an interest in working with the Company in some fashion.\nIn connection with such discussions, on May 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners introduced Rob Bernshteyn, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of the Company, to a representative of Thoma Bravo who they believed would be a useful contact for the Company in light of\nThoma Bravo\u2019s activity and experience in the software industry. On May 24, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn had an introductory telephonic conference call\nwith a representative of Thoma Bravo, during which call they discussed general trends in the industry. At no point during the call did the\nrepresentative of Thoma Bravo make a proposal to acquire the Company or state that Thoma Bravo wanted to pursue such an acquisition.\nDuring the summer of 2022, representatives of each of Thoma Bravo and two other private equity firms, which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d\nand \u201cFinancial Sponsor B\u201d, contacted Mr. Bernshteyn to propose meetings to discuss developments in the software industry, and Mr. Bernshteyn\nmet with representatives of Financial Sponsor B in response to this outreach. At no point during this meeting did the representatives of Financial\nSponsor B make a proposal to acquire the Company or state that Financial Sponsor B wanted to pursue such an acquisition. Mr. Bernshteyn did not\nmeet with representatives of Thoma Bravo or Financial Sponsor A in response to these requests until the interactions described below.\nDuring their regular meetings to discuss developments at the Company, Mr. Bernshteyn and Roger Siboni, the Company\u2019s lead independent director,\ndiscussed these interactions and agreed that this type of outreach would not alter the Company\u2019s focus on executing its standalone plan absent a\nsubstantive proposal that could be considered by the Board.\nOn September 6, 2022, after market close, the Company announced results for its second fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022. On the Company\u2019s\nearnings call, Mr. Bernshteyn noted that the current economic environment was highly dynamic and that it was unknown how the macroeconomic\npicture would play out. He stated that in the event that the economy were to experience a softer landing and the demand environment remained\nrelatively healthy, the Company would continue to thoughtfully invest for growth and balance such investments with profitability and, in the event\nof a recession, the Company would moderate its investments appropriately and, in more extreme cases, exercise significantly increased spending\ndiscipline.\n \n \n38\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents\nOn September 22, 2022, in response to the earlier outreach from Financial Sponsor A, Mr. Bernshteyn met with representatives of Financial Sponsor\nA for dinner, during which representatives of Financial Sponsor A told Mr. Bernshteyn that they were interested in learning more about the\nCompany.\nOn September 27, 2022, in response to the earlier outreach from Thoma Bravo, Mr. Bernshteyn met with representatives of Thoma Bravo for dinner,\nduring which the representatives of Thoma Bravo indicated interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company and stated that Thoma Bravo\nwould be willing to pay a premium of approximately 25% to the current share price of the Company\u2019s common stock (which had closed at $61.44 that\nday). Mr. Bernshteyn stated that he would discuss this indication of interest with the Board, noting that he did not believe the proposed premium\nwould be well received by the Board given the Company\u2019s standalone prospects. Mr. Bernshteyn told the representatives of Thoma Bravo that he\nwould put them in touch with Qatalyst Partners.\nOn September 28, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn called Mr. Siboni to discuss the recent interactions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Also on\nSeptember 28, 2022, a representative of Qatalyst Partners called a representative of Thoma Bravo to discuss the assumptions underlying Thoma\nBravo\u2019s proposal, and indicated that Thoma Bravo would need to improve the proposal for the Board to consider entering into discussions with\nrespect to a potential acquisition of the Company.\nOn September 30, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in acquiring\nthe Company in an all-cash transaction. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that Financial Sponsor A would need to make a more\nspecific proposal if the Board were to consider a potential transaction.\nThe representatives of Financial Sponsor A reached out to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners again on October 2, 2022 and presented a verbal,\nnon-binding proposal for an all-cash acquisition of the Company at a price between $78.00 and $82.00 per share, which proposal they were making\nbased on publicly available information. The closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on September 30, 2022, the last trading day prior to the\nreceipt of such proposal, was $58.80 per share. Financial Sponsor A also requested certain non-public information about the Company, which they\nindicated might help them to refine their view on the per share price that they would be willing to pay in an acquisition. Financial Sponsor A also\nstated to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it would want to speak to its limited partners in order to ensure that it could put together the\nequity financing for the transaction in light of conditions existing in the debt and equity financing markets. Later on October 2, 2022, representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners had a call with Mr. Bernshteyn to inform him of Financial Sponsor A\u2019s proposal and request for non-public information.\nOn October 3, 2022, Mr. Bernshteyn and Mr. Siboni met virtually to discuss the recent interactions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, and\ndetermined to set up a meeting of the full Board to discuss the situation.\nOn October 5, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo called representatives of Qatalyst Partners and presented a verbal, non-binding proposal for an\nall-cash acquisition of the Company at a price of $80.00 per share, which proposal was based on publicly available information. Thoma Bravo also\nrequested certain non-public information about the Company to better inform its perspective regarding valuation. Thoma Bravo stated that it also\nwanted to speak to its limited partners in order to ensure that it could arrange the equity financing for the transaction.\nOn October 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance\nto discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board\nfinancial information and metrics with respect to the two proposals and a preliminary illustrative financial analysis of the Company utilizing publicly\navailable information, including research analyst forecasts for the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed with the Board\nother parties who they believed might be interested in an acquisition of the Company and considerations for the Board regarding how they might\nrespond to the two proposals. The Board agreed to reconvene a few days later to continue discussing the proposals. The Board agreed that Qatalyst\nPartners should inform Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A that the Board was\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n39\nTable of Contents\nevaluating their offers. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A after the meeting to deliver\nthis message.\nOn October 10, 2022, Qatalyst Partners provided to the Company and the Board a disclosure statement identifying prior and current engagements\nand relationships between Qatalyst Partners and Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and the other parties identified by\nQatalyst Partners and reviewed with the Board at the October 6, 2022 meeting as being potentially interested in an acquisition of the Company.\nOn October 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nrepresentatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, the Company\u2019s outside counsel (which we refer to as \u201cFreshfields\u201d), in attendance to\nfurther discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board\nfinancial information and metrics with respect to the proposals, the Company\u2019s historical stock price performance and a preliminary financial analysis\nof the Company utilizing, for illustrative purposes, research analyst forecasts for the Company. Representatives of Freshfields reviewed with the\nBoard its fiduciary duties and other legal matters generally and in the context of an evaluation of a potential sale transaction. Following the\ndiscussion, the Board determined that it would be helpful to update the Company\u2019s existing long-term management financial plan and forecast and\nfor Qatalyst Partners to perform a financial analysis utilizing that updated plan and forecast before deciding whether to engage in discussions with\nThoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A and whether to reach out to additional parties regarding a potential acquisition of the Company, and\nrequested that management prepare an updated plan and forecast. The Board discussed whether it should create a transaction committee, but\ndeferred any decision on whether it should create such a committee until there was more clarity on how the overall situation would develop.\nOn October 21, 2022, the Board held another meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nFreshfields in attendance to further discuss the proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A. Company management informed the\nBoard that it had prepared an updated preliminary management plan and forecast, which it had provided to Qatalyst Partners for use in its financial\nanalysis with respect to the Company. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board financial metrics and information with respect to\nthe proposals, the Company\u2019s historical stock price performance and a preliminary illustrative financial analysis of the Company utilizing the updated\npreliminary management plan and forecast. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that the price of the Company\u2019s common stock had\ndeclined approximately 11% since the date of Financial Sponsor A\u2019s proposal and declined approximately 19% since the date of Thoma Bravo\u2019s\nproposal, broadly in line with the average stock price movement of companies in the mid-growth subscription software cohort (while the Nasdaq\ncomposite index had traded up 1% and down 4%, respectively, since such dates), and also that a price of $80.00 per share represented a premium of\n53% to the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on October 19, 2022. Representatives of the Company\u2019s management team then reviewed\nwith the Board the key components of the updated preliminary management plan and provided their perspective on the Company\u2019s recent\nperformance and outlook, including that overall the Company was going to face a challenging period over the next several years as overall business\nand macroeconomic conditions were likely to be difficult and present significant challenges for the Company\u2019s financial results, namely revenue\ngrowth and margins. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that research analyst forecasts for the Company were assuming better\nperformance than the updated preliminary management plan. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reviewed data showing that subscription\nsoftware revenue multiples had reached all-time highs in 2020 and 2021, but in 2022 had retreated meaningfully. The Board discussed the updated\npreliminary management plan with Company management and requested that management hold another session with the Board to more fully review\nthe underlying assumptions, including an analysis of potential upsides to the plan.\nAfter further discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the significant risks inherent in the Company\u2019s standalone plan and prospects relative\nto the price per share implied by the proposals made by Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, it made sense to provide limited additional non-\npublic information to the parties, as well as a management presentation and information session, to see if Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A\ncould provide offers that provided certain and compelling value to the Company\u2019s stockholders relative to its standalone prospects. The Board also\ndiscussed that, in light of the importance of certainty of funding, each of\n \n \n40\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nThoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A should also be permitted to contact a discrete number of their existing limited partners so that they could\nconfirm their ability to arrange the necessary equity financing for a transaction and authorized Qatalyst Partners to respond to those requests. The\nBoard also discussed whether to contact any other parties to see if they might be interested in a potential transaction with the Company and\ndiscussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Company management which financial and strategic parties would be most likely to be\ninterested in doing so. After discussion, the Board authorized Qatalyst Partners to contact Financial Sponsor B and two additional financial\nsponsors (referred to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor C\u201d and \u201cFinancial Sponsor D\u201d) to see if they were interested in a potential transaction with the Company\nand, if so, to ask them to provide a preliminary indication of interest based on public information as Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had done.\nThe Board determined not to contact any potential strategic acquirors at this time given the risk of a potential leak, as the most likely strategic\nacquirors operated in the same industry as the Company, but agreed to consider the matter further at a subsequent Board meeting. At the meeting,\nthe Board also reviewed the disclosure statement that had previously been provided by Qatalyst Partners and determined that the disclosure\nstatement did not present any material conflicts that would impair the ability of Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor. The\nBoard then discussed the formal engagement of Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor, noting Qatalyst Partners\u2019 long-standing relationship with\nthe Company as well as Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and the\nindustry in which it operates. The Board then approved the terms of the proposed form of engagement letter providing for Qatalyst Partners\u2019\nengagement as the Company\u2019s financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of the Company, which was executed by the Company and\nQatalyst Partners the following day.\nOn October 22, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A to inform them that the Company was\nwilling to provide them with limited non-public information and authorized them to contact limited partners as potential equity sources, and shared a\ndraft confidentiality agreement that had been prepared by Freshfields. On the same day, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Financial\nSponsor B and Financial Sponsor C indicating that the Company had received acquisition proposals, and inquired if they would be interested in a\npotential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners invited Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C to make\npreliminary proposals based on public information and sent the draft confidentiality agreement to each of them. On October 24, 2022, representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners reached out and sent the draft confidentiality agreement to Financial Sponsor D, indicating that the Company had received\nacquisition proposals, and invited them to make a preliminary proposal based on public information. The Company and Freshfields negotiated the\nterms of the confidentiality agreements with Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B over the next several days and executed the\nconfidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor A on October 26, 2022, and with each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor B on October 28,\n2022. All of these confidentiality agreements included customary standstill provisions that would terminate if, among other things, the Company\nentered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party. During the course of the negotiations of the\nconfidentiality agreements and discussions with Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, as authorized by the Board, Qatalyst Partners (in\nconsultation with Company management) separately agreed with each of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A which limited partners they would\nbe permitted to contact.\nOn October 27, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor C contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and stated that they might be interested\nin a potential transaction, and that based on their review of public information they were providing a verbal, non-binding proposal for an all-cash\nacquisition of the Company at a price of between $70.00 and $75.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that this would\nlikely not be sufficient to move forward. Following that discussion, the representatives of Financial Sponsor C contacted the representatives of\nQatalyst Partners again and indicated they could likely get to a price in the mid-$70s per share.\nAlso on October 27, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and expressed an interest in a\npotential transaction and provided an oral indication of value of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated that this would\nlikely not be sufficient to move forward.\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n41\nTable of Contents\nAlso on October 27, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent certain non-public financial and operating information regarding the Company to\nFinancial Sponsor A, and on October 28, 2022, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent the same information to Thoma Bravo.\nOn October 28, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor D informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that Financial Sponsor D was not\ninterested in proceeding with a potential acquisition of the Company because they did not believe they would be able to reach an acceptable value in\na competitive sale process. Financial Sponsor D never signed a confidentiality agreement with the Company.\nOn October 30, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management to review the updated preliminary management plan\nand forecast reflecting the feedback from the Board at the meeting on October 21, 2022. The Board provided input on the updated preliminary\nmanagement plan and forecast, noting areas where the preliminary management plan that had originally been presented by Company management on\nOctober 21, 2022 could be updated to include an alternative near-term macroeconomic scenario that was more optimistic in various respects,\nincluding with respect to cost reductions and margin improvement.\nOn October 31, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nFreshfields in attendance. Representatives of Company management reported that information had been provided to each of Thoma Bravo and\nFinancial Sponsor A, and management presentations had been scheduled for later in the week. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided an\nupdate on the oral indications that had been received from Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C. After discussion, the Board determined not\nto proceed with discussions with Financial Sponsor B or Financial Sponsor C at this stage or to provide them with non-public information regarding\nthe Company, as any leak or market rumor that indicated that the Company might be willing to consider a sale transaction at prices below those\nreflected in the current proposals from Thoma Bravo or Financial Sponsor A would be detrimental in extracting the highest price possible from those\ntwo bidders. The Board also considered contacting strategic parties and concluded, after discussion with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nCompany management, that three companies (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic Party E\u201d, \u201cStrategic Party F\u201d and \u201cStrategic Party G\u201d) were the strategic\nparties most likely to be interested in a potential transaction. The Board considered other strategic parties and concluded that those parties were not\nlikely to be interested in a potential transaction, given the Board\u2019s understanding of the likely areas of focus and strategic direction of those strategic\nparties. The Board instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to contact each of Strategic Party E, Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G.\nFollowing the Board meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C and\ncommunicated that their respective offers were not sufficient to warrant providing non-public information.\nLater that day, Mr. Bernshteyn reached out to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E to request a telephonic meeting.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G on October 31, 2022 and November 1, 2022, respectively, to\nask if they would be interested in a potential acquisition of the Company. Later on November 1, 2022, representatives of each of Strategic Party F and\nStrategic Party G told the representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were not interested in pursuing such an acquisition.\nAlso on November 1, 2022, in the morning, representatives of the Company met representatives of Thoma Bravo in person to provide the Company\u2019s\nmanagement presentation. Later on November 1, 2022, the representatives of the Company met representatives of Financial Sponsor A in person to\nprovide the Company\u2019s management presentation.\nAlso on November 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor C sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the\nCompany at a price between $70.00 and $75.00 per share, to formally register\n \n \n42\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\ntheir interest. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reiterated to representatives of Financial Sponsor C that their price was not sufficient to move\nforward in the process.\nAlso on November 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to indicate that they may be willing\nto increase their proposed price to between $80.00 and $82.00 per share if they were provided with non-public information about the Company, but\nexplained that this was a proposal Financial Sponsor B had limited confidence in given that they had not completed the diligence that would be\nrequired to fully understand the business. Based on this increase in indicative value, on November 2, 2022, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nprovided to Financial Sponsor B the non-public financial and operating information regarding the Company that had been provided to Thoma Bravo\nand Financial Sponsor A.\nOn November 3, 2022, the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E called Mr. Bernshteyn following Mr. Bernshteyn\u2019s initial outreach on October 31,\n2022. Mr. Bernshteyn told the chief executive officer of Strategic Party E that the Company had received inbound acquisition proposals and asked\nhim if Strategic Party E would be interested in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company. The chief executive officer of Strategic Party E told\nMr. Bernshteyn that Strategic Party E was interested in exploring a potential acquisition and would like to review non-public information regarding\nthe Company. Over the next two weeks, the parties negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement. During the pendency of that two-week\nperiod, the representatives of Qatalyst Partners engaged in a number of conversations with representatives of Strategic Party E to encourage them to\nmove more quickly as other parties were progressing with receiving non-public information and access to a management presentation.\nOn November 7, 2022, representatives of the Company met with representatives of Financial Sponsor B in person to provide the Company\u2019s\nmanagement presentation.\nOn November 9, 2022, despite the message from Qatalyst Partners that its proposed price was not sufficient, Financial Sponsor C executed a\nconfidentiality agreement with the Company. The confidentiality agreement included a customary standstill provision that would terminate if, among\nother things, the Company entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party.\nOn November 10, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they would be in a position to provide a\nrevised proposal by the following week. Also on November 10, representatives of Qatalyst Partners told representatives of Financial Sponsor A and\nFinancial Sponsor B, respectively, that they would need to provide revised proposals by November 17, 2022.\nOn November 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with Financial Sponsor A to understand how they were progressing, since\nFinancial Sponsor A had indicated they would be in a position to provide a revised indication by this date. Financial Sponsor A stated that it was\ntrying to remain in their initial range of $78.00 to 82.00 per share, and while it continued to work diligently, it would need access to full due diligence\nand access to debt financing sources to be able to put forth a revised, fully informed and certain proposal.\nAlso on November 16, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with a representative of Financial Sponsor B, and the representative of\nFinancial Sponsor B stated that, despite its prior indication that Financial Sponsor B might be able to get to a valuation range of between $80.00 and\n$82.00 per share, it was not likely to be able to do so and, based on the trends in the Company\u2019s business, Financial Sponsor B reverted back to its\ninitial price of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Financial Sponsor B also stated that they would need a partner to effect a transaction.\nOn November 17, 2022, the Company and Strategic Party E executed a confidentiality agreement that included a customary standstill provision that\nwould terminate if, among other things, the Company entered into an agreement providing for a change of control transaction with a third party. Later\nthat day, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Strategic Party E to provide the Company\u2019s management\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n43\nTable of Contents\npresentation. Given the Company\u2019s uncertainty at this stage about Strategic Party E\u2019s level of interest in an acquisition of the Company and the fact\nthat Strategic Party E was a potential competitor of the Company, Strategic Party E was not provided with the non-public financial and operating\ninformation regarding the Company that had been provided to Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B.\nAlso on November 17, 2022, in the evening, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent a letter to representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a non-binding\nproposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $75.00 per share. The letter noted that $75.00 per share represented a 55% premium to the\nCompany common stock\u2019s closing share price of $48.34 on that day and requested 30 days of exclusivity. On the same day, representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor A reached out to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and reaffirmed that they were continuing to work with their partners to\nremain within their initial indicative range of $78.00 to $82.00 per share.\nOn November 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and\nFreshfields in attendance to receive an update on the interactions that had occurred to date with various parties regarding a potential sale\ntransaction involving the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners stated that each of Strategic Party E, Strategic Party F and Strategic\nParty G had been contacted, and that Strategic Party F and Strategic Party G had both declined to pursue a potential transaction. The representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners said that Strategic Party E had expressed interest in pursuing a potential transaction, but that they were moving very slowly\ndespite strong encouragement from Qatalyst Partners to move more deliberately if they were genuinely interested. The representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed the revised and reaffirmed proposals received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, respectively, and reported that both\nThoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had stressed the importance of being able to conduct full due diligence and to talk to both equity and debt\nfinancing sources in order to be able to put forward firm proposals that were certain and actionable. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners then\nprovided updates on other interactions with financial sponsor parties, noting that Financial Sponsor D had declined to participate in the process.\nThe representatives of Qatalyst Partners also reported on the conversation with Financial Sponsor B, noting that they had not remained within their\nrevised indicative range of $80.00 to $82.00 per share, were now back to their initial indication at $70.00 per share and needed to add an equity partner\nin order to put forth a firm offer, citing the Company\u2019s recent deceleration in growth and declining bookings.\nAlso at the meeting, representatives of the Company\u2019s management team reviewed with the Board an updated preliminary management plan that\nreflected two scenarios, the first of which was consistent with the plan discussed with the Board at its meeting on October 21, 2022, and the second\nof which reflected the potential upsides discussed by management and the Board at that meeting and again at the meeting of the Board on October\n30, 2022. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed the Company\u2019s preliminary financial information and Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analysis with\nrespect to the Company utilizing the updated preliminary management plan. After discussion, the Board asked management to prepare a further\nrevised plan and forecast reflecting the conservative revenue growth assumptions in one of the two scenarios in light of the macroeconomic outlook,\nbut reflecting additional cost reductions by the Company in order to strengthen and improve margins, expressing the Board\u2019s view that such a\nforecast would reflect the Board\u2019s best estimates for the future outlook for the Company. After further discussion, the Board determined that, in light\nof the Company\u2019s standalone prospects and outlook, it would be beneficial to continue discussions with the parties that had expressed meaningful\ninterest in a potential acquisition of the Company and to allow them to complete their due diligence, receive and mark-up a merger agreement and\narrange financing so that the Company and the Board would then be in a position to have the firmest bids possible to evaluate if they provided\nsuperior value for stockholders relative to the Company\u2019s risk-adjusted standalone value. The Board determined to provide full due diligence access\nto Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, and also authorized representatives of Qatalyst Partners to provide diligence access at a future date to\nany other bidders who submitted proposals with an appropriate value range and had demonstrated conviction regarding a potential transaction,\nincluding as a potential equity partner to Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A or another bidder. The Board also discussed that, were the Company\nultimately to agree to a transaction, it would be optimal to announce the transaction on or prior to December 12, 2022, the scheduled date of the\nCompany\u2019s quarterly earnings call, because if the\n \n \n44\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nCompany common stock continued to trade negatively after the earnings announcement, there was significant risk that interested parties would\nreduce their offers based on any adverse market reaction to the earnings announcement.\nAlso at the Board meeting on November 18, 2022, the Board determined that it would be beneficial to create a committee so that a smaller group of\ndirectors would be available to Company management and the financial and legal advisors, including at times when it was not practicable to convene\nthe full Board. The Board then created a committee of the Board, which we refer to as the \u201ctransaction committee\u201d, for that purpose, comprised of\nindependent director Ms. Brennan, lead independent director Mr. Siboni and independent director Tayloe Stansbury. The transaction committee was\nnot created to address any actual or perceived conflict of interest.\nLater on November 18, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor B presented representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a verbal non-binding\nproposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price of $70.00 per share. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor B that they would not be moving forward.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Company made available to Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A due diligence materials through a virtual data room,\nand between November 21, 2022 and December 11, 2022, representatives of Company management and Qatalyst Partners had numerous calls and\nmeetings with representatives of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A regarding due diligence. Also on November 21, 2022, representatives of\nanother financial sponsor, which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor H\u201d reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in a\npotential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives of Financial Sponsor H to provide a\npreliminary indication of value based on public information.\nOn November 22, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Freshfields\nin attendance to review the key terms of the draft merger agreement that was being prepared by Freshfields before submitting the draft to potential\nbidders. After discussion, the transaction committee determined that the initial draft merger agreement should include, among other terms, (1) a go-\nshop period of 50 days, (2) a termination fee payable by the Company equal to 1.0% of the Company\u2019s fully diluted equity value based on the merger\nconsideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a superior proposal received prior to the end of\nthe go-shop period, (3) a termination fee payable by the Company equal to 2.0% of the Company\u2019s fully diluted equity value based on the merger\nconsideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain other circumstances and (4) a termination fee payable by the potential acquiror\nequal to 8.0% of the Company\u2019s fully diluted equity value based on the merger consideration if the merger agreement was terminated under certain\nother circumstances. The transaction committee instructed the representatives of Freshfields to update the draft merger agreement based on the\ndiscussions in the meeting.\nOn November 22, 2022, the compensation committee of the Board held a meeting by videoconference with representatives of Freshfields in\nattendance to review the treatment of equity awards in the draft merger agreement, as well as some of the key compensation and benefits-related\nterms of the draft merger agreement. The compensation committee noted that the draft merger agreement contemplated that Mr. Bernshteyn\u2019s July\n2022 Company PSUs would be treated in accordance with the terms of the underlying award agreement, which would likely result in those Company\nPSUs being cancelled for no consideration.\nAlso on November 22, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor I\u201d, reached out to representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives\nof Financial Sponsor I to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.\nOn November 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor I sent a letter to Qatalyst Partners detailing a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of\nthe Company at a price of $75.00 per share. While Financial Sponsor I\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n45\nTable of Contents\ninitially indicated that it would expect to lead an acquisition, it later informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they would instead be better\npositioned as an equity partner to another financial sponsor.\nAlso on November 23, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor H sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the\nCompany at a price per share of between $65.00 and $68.00 and stating that they would expect to co-lead the acquisition with one or more equity\npartners.\nAlso on November 23, 2022, representatives of Freshfields sent a draft merger agreement reflecting the terms approved by the transaction committee\nto representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Thoma Bravo\u2019s legal counsel (which we refer to as \u201cKirkland\u201d), and to representatives of Financial\nSponsor A\u2019s legal counsel.\nIn the afternoon of November 23, 2022, Bloomberg published an article stating that a certain financial sponsor was exploring an acquisition of the\nCompany but that no deal was imminent. Following the Bloomberg report, the Company\u2019s stock price closed at $58.93 on November 23, 2022,\ncompared to $45.72 on November 22, 2022 (the trading day ended immediately prior to the Bloomberg report).\nOn November 25, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to representatives of Financial Sponsor C to inform them that they would be\nprovided with access to non-public information regarding the Company. During the call, the representatives of Financial Sponsor C informed the\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were still in the range of $70.00 to $75.00 per share proposed in the letter they had sent to the Board on\nNovember 1, 2022. Later that day, the Company made available to Financial Sponsor C due diligence materials through the virtual data room.\nOn November 25, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent a draft confidentiality agreement to Financial Sponsor I, and the Company and Financial\nSponsor I executed the agreement on November 26, 2022.

Among the stockholders voicing concerns, some indicated that they would oppose a transaction for a sale of\nthe Company unless it were at a price above the price ultimately agreed to by Thoma Bravo, while others indicated that a price below that level would\nbe acceptable. Stockholders encouraging the Company to pursue a transaction indicated that they believed a well-run process would likely result in\nan acceptable value. All of these communications were shared with the Board.\nOn November 26, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Sponsor J\u201d, reached out to representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners told the representatives of\nFinancial Sponsor J to provide a preliminary indication of value based on public information.\nOn November 27, 2022, the draft merger agreement was posted to the virtual data room so that other parties (as well as Thoma Bravo and Financial\nSponsor A) would have access to it once they received data room access.\nOn November 28, 2022, representatives of Strategic Party E called representatives of Qatalyst Partners to communicate that they did not wish to\ncontinue discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company based on Strategic Party E\u2019s view of the Company\u2019s expected growth and\nmargins, operational challenges and integration complexity. Also on November 28, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as\n \n \n46\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\n\u201cFinancial Sponsor K\u201d, reached out to representatives of Qatalyst Partners to express an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company.

In both\nmeetings, it was discussed that Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A had completed the most work to date. It was also discussed that Strategic\nParty E had withdrawn from the process. It was also discussed that Financial Sponsor I had made a proposal at $75.00 per share, but that they had\ninformed Qatalyst Partners that they were more interested in acting as a financing source to another financial sponsor and so Qatalyst Partners had\nprovided them with access to the virtual data room. It was also discussed that Financial Sponsor H had provided an indication of interest at a price\nof between $65.00 and $68.00 per share, but given that their indication was so much lower than other involved parties, Financial Sponsor H would\nnot be given access to the virtual data room. The Board members were also informed of the outreach from Financial Sponsor K, Financial Sponsor L\nand Financial Sponsor M and that the representatives of Qatalyst Partners had told them to put forward a written non-binding proposal based on\npublic information for consideration by the Board if they were interested in doing so. During the transaction committee meeting, the transaction\ncommittee discussed with the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Freshfields a potential timeline for seeking fully diligenced and fully financed\nproposals for a potential transaction. The transaction committee instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to reach out to Thoma Bravo and\nFinancial Sponsor A (the two parties that were the most advanced in their efforts) to ask whether either party believed they would be able to finalize\ntheir due diligence and arrange financing by December 12th, which was the scheduled date of the Company\u2019s quarterly earnings call.\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n47\nTable of Contents\nAlso on November 30, 2022, after the Board meeting, representatives of Financial Sponsor M presented representatives of Qatalyst Partners with a\nverbal non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the Company at a price per share of between $70.00 and $75.00, subject to confirmation based on\nadditional diligence.\nOn December 1, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor K sent a letter to the Board with a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of the\nCompany at a price between $68.00 and $71.00 per share. Also on December 1, representatives of Financial Sponsor L called representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to say that they would be interested in playing a role in a potential acquisition of the Company as an equity partner to another\nbidder and at a price of between $70.00 and $80.00 per share. On the same day, representatives of Financial Sponsor J called representatives of\nQatalyst Partners to state that their interest was in potentially making an equity investment in the Company as opposed to an acquisition.\nLater on December 1, 2022, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Financial Sponsor I to provide the Company\u2019s\nmanagement presentation.\nOn December 2, representatives of Financial Sponsor A\u2019s legal counsel sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Freshfields.\nThis draft of the merger agreement (1) eliminated the go-shop provision, (2) proposed a Company termination fee of 3.75% of the fully diluted equity\nvalue of the Company based on the merger consideration, (3) provided that the Company was to reimburse Financial Sponsor A\u2019s transaction\nexpenses up to $40 million if the deal was terminated due to the Company\u2019s failure to obtain stockholder approval and (4) proposed an acquiror\ntermination fee of 4.25% of the fully diluted equity value of the Company based on the merger consideration.\nAlso on December 2, Mr. Siboni and a representative of Company management met with representatives of the large stockholder that had reached\nout to the Company on November 29, 2022. The stockholder expressed its views regarding a potential transaction and regarding the Company\u2019s\nstandalone prospects, and suggested that they may be supportive of a sale of the Company at a price at or below the price ultimately agreed to by\nThoma Bravo. Mr. Siboni and the representative of the Company were in \u201clisten only\u201d mode during the entirety of the meeting given that the\nCompany was in a quiet period leading up to quarterly earnings and because the Company had not made any public comment on the market\nspeculation regarding a potential sale.\nOn December 4, 2022, the transaction committee held a meeting by videoconference with Company management and representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners and Freshfields in attendance to receive an update on the status of discussions with the various potentially interested parties. The\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners reported that Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A continued to be the two parties that were working the\nhardest to complete due diligence and finalize their financing as promptly as practicable, including trying to see if a transaction could be finalized\nprior to December 12th (when the Company would be reporting its quarterly earnings). The representatives of Qatalyst Partners stated that Financial\nSponsor A indicated that it was possible they would need to partner with another financial sponsor as a financing source in order to obtain\ncommitted financing. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that, in thinking about who to partner with Financial Sponsor A (were they to\nneed a partner), an important consideration was whether a partner would impair getting the highest price by not being willing to support a bid at a\nvalue that the lead partner in the potential consortium was willing to pay. In that regard, they noted that Financial Sponsor I, who had expressed an\ninterest in participating in a transaction but had stated that they would not be able to effect a transaction on their own and would prefer to be a\npartner to another bidder, had given an indication of interest at a price of $75.00 per share of Company common stock and seemed to be fully\nengaged in due diligence. Other potential partners, on the other hand, either seemed less engaged and informed than Financial Sponsor I or had\nexpressed an interest in a transaction at lower values.

After further\ndiscussion, the Board instructed the representatives of Qatalyst\n \n \n50\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nPartners to let Thoma Bravo know that they were not the highest bidder and, as a result, if they were not able to improve their bid the Company\nwould not transact with them and would go in a different direction. The Board also instructed the representatives of Qatalyst Partners to let Financial\nSponsor A know that there were a number of places in their draft transaction documents where the Board wanted to see improvement. The\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners conveyed these messages to representatives of Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A, respectively, shortly\nafter the meeting.

After\ndiscussion, the Board determined that it needed to obtain improved proposals at higher prices from each bidder, and that the best way to achieve\nthis objective was to set a final bid deadline for the following day at which time both bidders would need to have all of their transaction\ndocumentation finalized and then submit \u201cbest and final bids\u201d so that the Board could have the firmest bids possible so it could then evaluate\nwhether the bids provided superior value for stockholders relative to the Company\u2019s risk-adjusted standalone value.

The Board discussed the proposals that had been received from Thoma Bravo and Financial Sponsor A with\nCompany management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Freshfields and concluded that the Thoma Bravo proposal was more favorable\nto the Company on financial and legal terms. A representative of Freshfields delivered a legal presentation outlining the terms of the final draft of the\nmerger agreement and the final drafts of the debt and equity financing documentation that representatives of Thoma Bravo had delivered, and\nreviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties. Following the legal presentation, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its\nfinancial analyses of the merger consideration proposed by Thoma Bravo and, at the request of the Board, rendered to the Board its oral opinion,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B,\nto the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters\nset forth therein, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of\nshares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n51\nTable of Contents\nParent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d. The Board also reviewed an updated disclosure statement from Qatalyst\nPartners identifying prior or current engagements or relationships between Qatalyst Partners and affiliates of Thoma Bravo, Financial Sponsor A,\nFinancial Sponsor C, Financial Sponsor I and certain equity financing sources of the foregoing. The Board then recessed and the compensation\ncommittee conducted a meeting with the full Board in attendance, and reviewed and approved the treatment of the Company\u2019s outstanding equity\nawards in the merger agreement as well as certain other compensation and benefits-related matters in the merger agreement. Following the meeting of\nthe compensation committee, the Board reconvened.\nAfter discussion and consideration of a variety of factors, including those discussed under \u201c\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u201d, the Board resolved to\nproceed with the proposal from Thoma Bravo and unanimously (1) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the\nCompany of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the\nmerger, (2) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to enter into the merger agreement and\ndeclared the merger agreement advisable, (3) directed that the Company submit the adoption of the merger agreement to a vote of the holders of\nCompany common stock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company common\nstock adopt the merger agreement.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board, the parties executed the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the voting agreement,\nthe debt and equity commitment letters and the limited guarantee.\nThe following morning, on December 12, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the\nproposed terms of the acquisition by Thoma Bravo.",

The merger consideration of $81.00\nper share was an attractive value for the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and represented:\n \n\u2022\na 77% premium over the $45.72 closing price of the Company common stock on November 22, 2022 (the last full trading day\nprior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company)\u037e\n \n\u2022\na 72% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $47.12 reported for the five-trading\nday period ended November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\na 64% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $49.41 reported for the 30-trading\nday period ended November 22, 2022\u037e and\n \n\u2022\na 37% premium over the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock of $59.02 reported for the 90-trading\nday period ended November 22, 2022\u037e\n \n\u2022\nRisks relating to remaining a stand-alone company. The Board evaluated the Company\u2019s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an\nindependent public company, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation included the Board\u2019s\nreview of the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the\nindustry in which the Company competes, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified) of those factors on the trading\nprice of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Board ultimately determined that the certainty of value provided by the acquisition of the\nCompany by Parent for $81.00 per share in cash was more favorable to Company stockholders than the risk-adjusted value of remaining\nan independent public company, after accounting for the risks and uncertainties that the Company would face if it continued to operate\non a standalone public company basis. Such risks include:\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the industry in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, the competitive market for BSM\nsoftware\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the Company\u2019s ability to sustain its historical revenue growth given the deceleration of momentum in the\nbusiness amid a turbulent macroeconomic environment that has contributed to a meaningful decline in new ACV bookings\ngrowth during fiscal year 2023\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks related to the Company\u2019s ability to meet public market analysts\u2019 expectations of future growth, including the fact that\nmanagement\u2019s forecasted revenue growth for fiscal year 2024 and 2025 in the Financial Forecasts is considerably lower than\npublic market analysts\u2019 estimates\u037e\n \n\u2022\nchallenges of making potential investments to achieve long-term growth prospects while a publicly traded company that is\nsubject to scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance, including the likely need for organizational changes to\noptimize the Company\u2019s business if the Company were to remain a standalone company\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s recent third quarter 2023 financial results, which were below certain analyst expectations of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial performance.\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including\nemployment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations\u037e\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n53\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the operation of the Company, including, but not limited to, adverse global economic conditions, including\nrising interest rates, macroeconomic headwinds, volatility in the public markets, the deterioration or disruption in the software\nmarket, financial markets or global supply chains, including the impact of geopolitical events, including the possibility that\nbusiness conditions, for the Company and the larger economy, may not improve and could get worse\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the Company\u2019s sale of its services to enterprises with complex operating environments, which tend to result in\nlong and unpredictable sales cycles\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to existing customers\u2019 subscription renewals and purchase of additional subscriptions\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to ongoing lawsuits and claims related to intellectual property rights or other legal and regulatory matters\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to any failure of the Company to protect its intellectual property rights\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the Company\u2019s ability to integrate its platform with a variety of third-party technologies\u037e\n \n\u2022\nrisks relating to the Company\u2019s substantial debt obligations, including the Convertible Notes and other obligations, which could\nimpair the Company\u2019s financial condition and adversely affect its ability to settle conversions of, or to refinance, repurchase or\nredeem, the Convertible Notes and to fund its operations or other capital requirements\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2022 and on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2022, July 31, 2022 and October 31,\n2022.\n \n\u2022\nProcess to explore a sale of the Company. The Board considered the process it undertook, with the assistance of its independent\nfinancial advisor, for soliciting and responding to offers from the financial and strategic third parties that were believed to be the most\nwilling and able to pay the highest and best price for the Company, which included contacting, or responding to, 14 potential acquirors,\nentering into non-disclosure agreements with seven potential acquirors, providing management presentations to five potential\nacquirors, granting access to a data room containing detailed due diligence materials to four potential acquirors, receiving non-binding\noffers from eight potential acquirors and receiving two final fully diligenced and financed proposals, one of which was from Thoma\nBravo, and the fact that, although several of the potential acquirors had noted the difficulty in obtaining financing and the terms\navailable in the current condition of the financing markets, Thoma Bravo had obtained committed debt and equity financing for the full\namount necessary to fund the aggregate merger consideration, including the fact that, despite the increased likelihood of interested\nthird parties as a result of Bloomberg\u2019s publication of an article on November 23, 2022 stating that a certain financial sponsor was\nexploring an acquisition of the Company, no other potential acquirors provided the Company with a proposal superior to that of Thoma\nBravo, as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u037e Change in Board\nRecommendation\u201d, in each case as further described above under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the\nMerger\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nStrategic alternatives to a sale of the Company. The Board considered the potential risks, benefits and uncertainties associated with\nremaining an independent public company as a possible strategic alternative to the sale of the entire Company (including the potential\nvalue to Company stockholders based on the Company\u2019s strategic plan that could be expected to be generated from remaining an\nindependent public company). Based on the foregoing, the Board determined that such alternatives were not likely to create more value\non a risk-adjusted basis than the merger consideration for the foreseeable future.\n \n\u2022\nNegotiations with interested parties. The Board considered the course and history of competitive, extensive and arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations with two third parties that submitted fully diligenced and fully\n \n \n54\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nfinanced offers, which negotiations the Board believed resulted in the Company obtaining the highest and best price that the Thoma\nBravo Fund was willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company\u2019s ability to increase the Thoma Bravo Fund\u2019s proposed\nprice per share of Company common stock from $75.00 in its November 17, 2022 initial written proposal to $81.00 per share in its\nDecember 11, 2022 final offer, as further described above under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the\nMerger\u201d. It is the Board\u2019s belief that, based on discussions with the Thoma Bravo Fund and other potential counterparties, the final\nproposal submitted by the Thoma Bravo Fund represented the best and final offer and the highest price per share of Company common\nstock that the Thoma Bravo Fund or any other potential counterparty would be willing to pay, particularly given the condition of the\nfinancing markets and broader macroeconomic climate, and any request for a further price increase or solicitation of additional bids from\nother third parties would have created a meaningful risk that the Thoma Bravo Fund might determine to withdraw its final proposal and\nto terminate negotiations, in which event Company stockholders would lose the opportunity to obtain the proposed $81.00 per share of\nCompany common stock in cash being offered.\n \n\u2022\nFinancial conditions, results of operations and prospects of the Company. The Board considered the Company\u2019s operating and\nfinancial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement, which reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management, and the inherent uncertainty of achieving\nsenior management\u2019s prospective forecasts, as set forth below under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c \u2014Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d, and that as a result the Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from senior management\u2019s\nforecasts. The Board also considered its assessment, taking into account the other factors described herein, of the Company\u2019s value on\na standalone basis relative to the $81.00 per share of Company common stock to be paid in cash in connection with the merger, and the\npossibility that the trading price of shares of Company common stock would not reach and sustain such price, or that doing so could\ntake a considerable period of time.\n \n\u2022\nEconomic conditions. The Board considered the then current state of the economy, debt financing markets and uncertainty\nsurrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near term and the long term, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial\nperformance.\n \n\u2022\nCash consideration. The Board considered the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, which provides certainty, immediate value\nand liquidity to holders of Company common stock, especially when viewed against any internal or external risks and uncertainties\nassociated with the Company\u2019s stand-alone strategy, immediately upon the closing of the merger. The Board weighed the certainty of\nrealizing a compelling value for shares of Company common stock by virtue of the merger against the uncertain prospect that the\ntrading value for the Company\u2019s common stock would approach the merger consideration within the foreseeable future, which the\nBoard considered unlikely. In reaching such a conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors, including that the Company\u2019s\nmarket value immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement likely reflected speculation on a potential acquisition of the\nCompany and that, if the Board were not to engage in a transaction, the Company\u2019s market value would likely decline, potentially\nsignificantly.\n \n\u2022\nOpinion of Qatalyst Partners. The Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Board by representatives\nof Qatalyst Partners, as well as the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, which written opinion is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex B, rendered to the Board, that as of December 11, 2022, and based upon and subject to the\nvarious qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received by the\nholders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such holders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described below in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d.\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n55\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nCapabilities of Thoma Bravo. The Board considered the consolidated financial strength and industry expertise of Thoma Bravo,\nincluding the successful track record that Thoma Bravo has developed in acquiring other companies, and in particular other public\ncompanies.\n \n\u2022\nAvailability and certainty of financing. The Board considered the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition, that the\nThoma Bravo Fund has obtained committed debt financing for the merger from reputable financing sources, and that the Thoma Bravo\nFund has committed to make available and provide to Parent, pursuant to the equity commitment letter, the full amount necessary, along\nwith the committed debt financing, to fund the aggregate merger consideration, as further described below in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d. The Board also considered the fact that if any portion of the debt financing for the\nmerger becomes unavailable, Parent is required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to\nconsummate the merger.\n \n\u2022\nMerger agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the structure of the transaction,\nthe all-cash form of the merger consideration, the limited conditions to closing and the customary nature of the representations,\nwarranties, covenants and agreements of the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Parent,\nwhich were conducted at arm\u2019s length and during which the Board was advised by experienced independent legal and financial\nadvisors. The Board took into account the terms of the merger agreement, including:\n \n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company to seek specific performance of Parent\u2019s obligations under the\nmerger agreement, including to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain debt financing\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, if the debt financing is available at closing, to force the equity\nfinancing to be funded and Parent to consummate the merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Company, in response to certain unsolicited takeover proposals, to\nfurnish information to and conduct discussions and negotiations with third parties prior to the Company stockholder approval\nunder certain circumstances and, under certain conditions, to accept a superior proposal, and the Company\u2019s corresponding\nright to terminate the merger agreement (subject to the payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $200 million and\ncertain rights of Parent to match the superior proposal) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the\nconsummation of such superior proposal\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe provisions of the merger agreement that permit the Board, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the merger agreement\nproposal, not to include, or to withdraw or modify in a matter adverse to Parent, its recommendation in the proxy statement to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders to vote to adopt the merger agreement under certain circumstances relating to a superior proposal or\nintervening event, subject to payment to Parent of the Company termination fee of $200 million if Parent elects to terminate the\nmerger agreement in such circumstances, and that the amount of the Company termination fee is comparable to termination\nfees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be\npaid unless the Company entered into a more favorable transaction\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe fact that the Thoma Bravo Fund has provided a limited guarantee, which supports Parent\u2019s obligation to pay the Parent\ntermination fee to the extent payable, in favor of the Company as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201c\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the debt and equity financing documents and the limited guarantee,\nwhich were reviewed by the Board with the\n \n \n56\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nCompany\u2019s financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between the parties.\n \n\u2022\nProbability of consummation of the merger. The Board considered the high probability that the merger would be consummated in a\nreasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner, which could reduce the period during which the Company\u2019s business would be subject\nto the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption. The Board based this consideration on, among other things, the absence\nof a financing contingency and the $435 million Parent termination fee, payable to the Company if the merger agreement is terminated in\ncertain circumstances, payment of which is guaranteed by the Thoma Bravo Fund as described under \u201c\u2014Financing of the Merger\u2014\nLimited Guarantee\u201d pursuant to the limited guarantee delivered by it, the Thoma Bravo Fund\u2019s ability to complete large acquisition\ntransactions and Thoma Bravo\u2019s experience with transactions in the software industry.\n \n\u2022\nThe Board\u2019s unanimous approval. The Board considered the fact that resolutions approving the merger were unanimously approved by\nthe Board, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors who are not affiliated with the Company and are not employees of\nthe Company or any of its subsidiaries.\n \n\u2022\nStockholders\u2019 ability to reject the merger. The Board considered the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of Company\nstockholders, and Company stockholders would be free to reject the merger by voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.\n \n\u2022\nAppraisal rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company stockholders who do not vote\nfor approval of the merger agreement and who comply with all of the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL\nin connection with the merger, including the fact that such stockholders will have the right to demand appraisal and payment of the fair\nvalue of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201c\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the merger agreement and\nthe merger, including the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n \n\u2022\nRisks associated with failure to consummate the merger on a timely basis or at all. The Board considered the risks and costs to the\nCompany if the merger does not close on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all due to a failure of certain conditions,\nincluding with respect to the required approval of the transaction by the required regulatory authorities, including:\n \n\u2022\nthe trading price of Company common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of the Company common stock\ncurrently reflects positive market assumptions that the merger will be consummated\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe potential negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, hire and retain key employees, as current and prospective\nemployees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company following the merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe potential disruption to the Company\u2019s business and distraction of its workforce and management team from day-to-day\noperations and from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to the Company, in each case without realizing any of\nthe benefits of having the merger completed\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nreputational harm to the Company\u2019s relationships with investors, customers, suppliers, business partners and other third\nparties due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the merger.\n \n\u2022\nRestrictions on the operation of our business. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business prior\nto the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent the\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n57\nTable of Contents\nCompany from undertaking certain significant financing transactions and business opportunities that may arise or any other action that\nit might otherwise take with respect to the operations and strategy of the Company, even if such actions would prove beneficial to the\nCompany.\n \n\u2022\nRegulatory risk. The Board considered the risk that the parties may incur significant costs and material delays resulting from seeking\nregulatory approvals and other clearances, consents and approvals necessary for consummation of the merger.\n \n\u2022\nAbility to respond to alternative proposals. The Board considered the fact that the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the\nCompany\u2019s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding alternative takeover proposals with third parties,\nsubject to specified exceptions, and that require the Company to negotiate with Parent (if Parent desires to propose revisions to the\nmerger agreement and negotiate) prior to the Company being able to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The\nBoard further considered the possibility that the Company\u2019s obligation to pay the Company termination fee of $200 million to Parent\nupon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirors from making an\nalternative proposal to acquire the Company.\n \n\u2022\nTransaction costs. The Board considered the significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and\nconsummating the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and integration costs, and the fact that if the merger is not\nconsummated, the Company may be required to bear such costs.\n \n\u2022\nFuture increases in the price of Company common stock. The Board considered the possibility that, although the merger provides the\nCompany stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which Company common stock traded prior to the public\nannouncement of the merger, the price of Company common stock might have increased in the future to a price greater than the merger\nconsideration.\n \n\u2022\nLitigation risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated therein.\n \n\u2022\nTax treatment. The Board considered the fact that an all-cash transaction would be taxable to the holders of common stock that are U.S.\nholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n \n\u2022\nOther risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the merger and the business of the Company, as more fully\ndescribed above in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nIn addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger\nthat may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company stockholders generally, as described more fully below in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors considered\nby the Board. The Board unanimously reached the conclusion to (1) authorize and approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company\nof the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (2)\ndetermine that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to enter into the merger agreement and declare the\nmerger agreement advisable, (3) direct that the Company submit the adoption of the merger agreement to a vote of the holders of Company common\nstock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and (4) resolve to recommend that the holders of Company common stock adopt the\nmerger agreement in light of the factors described above and other factors that the Board believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of\nfactors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of\n \n \n58\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nthe merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign\nrelative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether\nany particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board. Rather, the Board\nmade its recommendation based on the totality of the information available to the Board, including discussions with, and questioning of, the\nCompany\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the Board may have\ngiven different weights to different factors.\nThis explanation of the Board\u2019s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and,\ntherefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d.",

However, the Company has included in this proxy statement a summary of certain financial forecasts of the Company that were furnished\nto (1) the Board, Qatalyst Partners (the Company\u2019s financial advisor) and Thoma Bravo in connection with the discussions concerning the proposed\nmerger and (2) certain other parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company.\nThe Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the\nSEC regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nNo assurances can be made regarding future events and the estimates and assumptions underlying the Financial Forecasts involve judgments with\nrespect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not\nbe realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including,\namong other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic conditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates and\nthe risks and uncertainties described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u201d, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company and, upon consummation of the merger,\nwill be beyond the control of Thoma Bravo, Parent and the surviving corporation. Company stockholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s SEC\nfilings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying the\nFinancial Forecasts will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized. Actual results may differ materially from those reflected in\nthe Financial Forecasts, whether or not the merger is consummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial Forecasts should not be\nregarded as an indication that the Company, the Board, Qatalyst Partners, Thoma Bravo or any other person considered, or now consider, these\nforecasts to be a reliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they nor any underlying assumptions should be\nrelied on as being indicative of future results. Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial\nForecasts assumed that the Company would continue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impacts of the merger.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures.\u201d These are financial performance measures\nthat are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n59Table of Contents\nthat the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or\nprinciples and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company\u2019s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestors should also note that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement have no standardized meaning prescribed by\nGAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures in\nthis proxy statement and the accompanying footnotes may be calculated differently from, and may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled\nmeasures used by the Company\u2019s competitors and other companies, or any similarly titled measures used by Thoma Bravo or any of its affiliates.\nDue to the inherent limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a\nsubstitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The footnotes to the tables below\nprovide certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Financial Forecasts included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company\u2019s management. Ernst & Young\nLLP, the Company\u2019s independent auditor, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the\naccompanying Financial Forecasts and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements.\nIt does not extend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts were approved by the Board for use by Qatalyst Partners and were relied on\nby Qatalyst Partners for its financial analysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its consideration of the merger.\nFinancial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination\ntransaction, such as the Financial Forecasts, are excluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and\nregulations. As a result, the Financial Forecasts are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would\notherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied on by the Board or Qatalyst Partners in connection with their respective\nevaluations of the merger. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the\nFinancial Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nBy including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, neither the Company nor Thoma Bravo nor any of their respective\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the\ninformation contained in the Financial Forecasts. Accordingly, the Financial Forecasts should not be construed as financial guidance, nor relied on\nas such, and the Financial Forecasts may differ in important respects from the 2022 earnings guidance, some of which guidance was presented as a\nrange when first issued, and all of which was subsequently withdrawn, and which the Company\u2019s management prepared based on a different set of\nassumptions.

        "Section Header": "Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor",
        "Section Text": "Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\nThe Company retained Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction such as the merger and to evaluate\nwhether the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of\nCompany common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected\nQatalyst Partners to act as the Company\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 long-standing relationship with the Company as well as\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and the industry in which it\noperates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board\non December 11, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date\nthereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the merger\nconsideration to be received pursuant to, and in\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n61Table of Contents\naccordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent)\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, to the Board\nfollowing the meeting of the Board.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated December 11, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by reference\nherein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and\nqualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. Company stockholders should read the opinion carefully in\nits entirety. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of\nshares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the\nmerger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Company common stock should vote with respect to the merger\nor any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any\ntime. The summary of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, certain related documents and certain publicly available\nfinancial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the Financial Forecasts prepared\nby the management of the Company, described in the section above entitled \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Forecasts.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company.\nQatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared the financial performance\nof the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and\ntheir securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With\nrespect to the Financial Forecasts, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of the Company, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on\ndiscussions with the management of the Company and the Board, that the Financial Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the\nbest currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other\nmatters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to the Financial Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst\nPartners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed\nmerger agreement, and that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without any\nmodification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the merger,\nno delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits\nexpected to be derived in the merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners\nrelied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and\nproducts of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion has been approved by its opinion\ncommittee in accordance with its customary practice.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the\n \n \n62\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nopinion may affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to\nupdate, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the\nmerger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion\nis limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of\nthe merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst Partners\nexpressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of the\nCompany or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated December 11, 2022.\nThe analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering\nall analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion. For purposes of its\nanalyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the Financial Forecasts, described in the section above entitled \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d and third-\nparty research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 (which are referred to as the \u201cstreet case\u201d). Some of the summaries of the\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand\nthe financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth\nbelow without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the\nanalyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 financial analyses.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nQatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values\nfor Company common stock as of October 31, 2022 (which is the end of the Company\u2019s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance\nsheet date) by:\n \n\u2022\nadding:\n \n(a)\nthe implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows (which are referred to as the \u201cUFCF\u201d) of the\nCompany, based on the Financial Forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 (which implied\npresent value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 13.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of\ncapital for the Company)\u037e\n \n(b)\nthe implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by multiplying the Company\u2019s\nestimated UFCF in fiscal year 2028 of approximately $360 million, based on the Financial Forecasts (assuming a long-term cash tax\nrate of 15%, as provided by management of the Company), by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months\u2019\nestimated UFCF multiples of 20.0x to 32.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience), and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above\u037e\n \n(c)\nthe cash and cash equivalents of the Company as of October 31, 2022, as provided by management of the Company\u037e and\n \n(d)\nthe implied net present value of estimated federal tax savings due to its net operating losses for the fiscal years 2028 and beyond,\nas provided by management of the Company, discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a)\nabove\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nsubtracting:\n \n(a)\nthe face value of the outstanding Convertible Notes as of October 31, 2022, and the Company\u2019s redeemable non-controlling\ninterests in Coupa K.K.

The companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which\nwere selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded companies in similar lines of\nbusiness to the Company, have a similar business model, have similar financial performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.\nBased upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of December 9, 2022 and using the closing prices as of December 9, 2022 for shares\nof the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus\nrevenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the \u201cCY2023E revenue multiples\u201d), for each of the selected companies, as shown below:\n \nSelected Companies\nCY2023E\nRevenue\nMultiple\nServiceNow, Inc.\n8.8x\nAdobe Inc.\n7.9x\nBlackLine, Inc.\n7.5x\nQualys, Inc.\n7.4x\nKinaxis Inc.\n7.1x\nWorkiva, Inc.\n6.9x\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.\n6.8x\nWorkday, Inc.\n6.1x\nTenable Holdings, Inc.\n5.6x\nFive9, Inc.\n5.6x\nUiPath, Inc.\n5.1x\nBox, Inc.\n4.6x\nDocuSign, Inc.\n3.9x\nSalesforce, Inc.\n3.8x\nNew Relic, Inc.\n3.8x\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n3.8x\nQualtrics, LLC\n3.5x\nRingCentral, Inc.\n2.2x\nBased on an analysis of the CY2023E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst\nPartners selected a representative multiple range of 3.8x to 7.0x.\nQatalyst Partners then applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023, based on the Financial Forecasts and based on\nthe street case.

In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters.\nMany of these matters are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s business or the industry in\ngeneral, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in\nthe financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is\nnot in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nQatalyst Partners compared fifty-one selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines\nof business to the Company or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or similar characteristics.\nFor each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the\ntarget company as a multiple of last-twelve-months\u2019 revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cLTM revenue multiples\u201d) and (b)\nthe implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-\nmonths\u2019 revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the \u201cNTM revenue multiples\u201d).\n \nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\n10/27/22\nUserTesting, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n6.2x\n5.3x\n10/12/22\nKnowBe4, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n14.9x\n11.4x\n10/11/22\nForgerock, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.5x\n8.4x\n09/28/22\nBTRS Holdings Inc.\nEQT X Fund\n9.7x\n7.9x\n08/08/22\nAvalara, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n10.5x\n8.7x\n08/03/22\nPing Identity Holding Corp.\nThoma Bravo\n8.9x\n8.0x\n06/24/22\nZendesk, Inc.\nHellman & Friedman LLC & Permira Advisers\nLLC\n6.8x\n5.4x\n06/06/22\nAnaplan, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n16.0x\n12.8x\n04/11/22\nDatto Holding Corp.\nKaseya Inc. & Insight Partners, LLC\n9.7x\n8.3x\n04/11/22\nSailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n15.7x\n13.3x\n12/07/21\nMimecast Limited\nPermira Holdings Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n12/01/21\nBlue Prism Group PLC\nSS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n7.2x\n5.8x\n08/19/21\nInovalon Holdings, Inc.\nNordic Capital Limited\n10.0x\n8.8x\n08/05/21\nCornerstone OnDemand, Inc.\nClearlake Capital Group, L.P.\n6.3x\n5.9x\n07/26/21\nMedallia, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n13.0x\n10.8x\n06/28/21\nQAD Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n5.8x\n5.3x\n04/26/21\nProofpoint, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n10.8x\n9.4x\n03/10/21\nTalend S.A.\nThoma Bravo\n8.5x\n7.4x\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n65\nTable of Contents\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nLTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\n03/08/21\nPluralsight, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n9.8x\n8.4x\n12/21/20\nRealPage, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n9.1x\n8.2x\n12/17/19\nLogMeIn, Inc.\nFrancisco Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital\n3.5x\n3.4x\n12/04/19\nInstructure Holdings, Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n7.7x\n6.5x\n06/12/19\nMedidata Solutions, Inc.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes SE\n8.8x\n7.5x\n02/12/19\nEllie Mae, Inc.\nThoma Bravo, LLC\n7.0x\n6.8x\n02/04/19\nThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.\nInvestors Group Inc.\n10.0x\n8.4x\n12/24/18\nMINDBODY, Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management, LLC\n7.8x\n6.7x\n12/23/18\nMYOB Group Limited\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

Based on the fully diluted shares of Company\ncommon stock outstanding as of December 8, 2022 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis,\nwith the exception of assuming cash settlement of the Convertible Notes with an assumed make whole adjustment and cash settlement of the capped\ncalls related to the 2025 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes based on a Black-Scholes option calculation model), as provided by\nmanagement of the Company, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $43.13 to $92.31 per share.\nBased on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a\nrepresentative multiple range of 5.5x to 9.5x, then applied this range to the Company\u2019s estimated next-twelve-months\u2019 revenue (calculated as the four\nquarters ending on October 31, 2023) based on the street case. Based on the same fully diluted share count as used in the immediately preceding\nparagraph, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $47.07 to $92.83 per share.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the merger. In evaluating the selected\ntransactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company\u2019s\nbusiness or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial condition and\nprospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value\nof the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean,\nmedian, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of\nthese transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.\nMiscellaneous\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes\nof rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary\ndescription. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses\nas a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have\ngiven various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less\nprobable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to\nbe Qatalyst Partners\u2019 view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with\nrespect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of the Company. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nQatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common\nstock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which\nCompany common stock might actually trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.\nQatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the Board in deciding to approve the merger\nagreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n67\nTable of Contents\nas determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms\nof the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Company common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Board\nwould have been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration payable in the merger was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between the Company and Thoma Bravo and was approved by the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during\nthese negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Company or that any specific consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which\nconflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Thoma Bravo, Parent or certain of\ntheir respective affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst\nPartners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Thoma Bravo or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its\naffiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company, Thoma\nBravo or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided the Company with financial advisory services in connection with the merger\nfor which it will be paid an aggregate amount currently estimated at approximately $90 million, $5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its\nopinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation\nof the merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company\nhas also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and\nany person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws,\nand certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 engagement.",

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company\ncommon stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair\nvalue of their shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your\nshares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger consideration that you\nare otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are known as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice\nof such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nThey will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Company common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by,\nthe Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company common stock\ndetermined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive\npursuant to the merger agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all\nof the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the\ncomplexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors\nbefore attempting to exercise such rights.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.

Any person who desires to\nexercise his, her or its appraisal rights should carefully review Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal and financial advisors before\nelecting or attempting to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a\nrecommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. As used in this section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d, the word\n\u201cstockholder\u201d means a holder of record of shares of Company common stock, the words \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d mean a person who is the beneficial\nowner of shares of Company common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person and the word \u201cperson\u201d means any\nindividual corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to\nreceive the merger consideration under the merger agreement.\nA holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (1) continuously holds such shares through the effective time, (2)\nhas not voted in favor of or otherwise consented to the merger in writing or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (3) strictly complies\nwith the procedures under Section 262, (4) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (5) in the case of a\nbeneficial owner, a person who (a) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (b)\nprovides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial\n \n \n72\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents\nownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (c) provides an address at which\nsuch beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled\nto receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair\nvalue.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that\nappraisal rights will be available not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section\n262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription\nor cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger,\nin compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of\nSection 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to\nthe Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Company common stock before the taking of the vote on the merger, which demand\nmust reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or\nits shares of Company common stock and, for beneficial owners only, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such\nbeneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and\nmust provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List\u037e\nyou must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e you must hold your shares of Company common stock\ncontinuously through the effective time\u037e and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of Section 262.\nA Company stockholder or beneficial owner who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the\nfollowing address:\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n1855 S. Grant Street\nSan Mateo, CA 94402\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nA record holder who holds shares of Company common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record\nowner. In such case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of Company common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of\nshares of Company common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Company common stock outstanding\nin the name of such record owner. If you hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish such\nholder, as the holder of record of your shares of Company common stock, to exercise appraisal rights on your behalf, you should consult with your\nbank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker\nor other nominee.\nWithin ten days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the merger has become effective to each of (1) each\nCompany stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement and (2) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any\nperson who\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n73\nTable of Contents\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the merger consideration\nspecified by the merger agreement for that person\u2019s shares of Company common stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and timely demanded\nappraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy\nappraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy\nserved on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock,\ndemanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Company common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no\npresent intent on the part of the Company or the surviving corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights\nshould assume that the Company and the surviving corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value\nof shares of Company common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their shares of Company common stock appraised should initiate\nany petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within 120\ndays after the effective time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded\nappraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration under the merger agreement.\nIn addition, within 120 days after the effective time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be\nentitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company\ncommon stock not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the surviving corporation and the\naggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand for\nappraisal, the record holder of such shares will not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate\nnumber). Such statement must be given within ten days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within\nten days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation\nshall be required to, within 20 days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and with whom the\nsurviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by\nthe Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving\ncorporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will determine which persons have\ncomplied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have\ndemanded an appraisal of their shares of Company common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of\nshares of Company common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person\nfails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, the shares\nof the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court will dismiss the appraisal\nproceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal\nexceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such\ntotal number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its\ndiscretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of\n \n \n74\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nthe persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally\ndetermined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including\nany rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of\nCompany common stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time through the\ndate the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time\nduring the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings,\nthe surviving corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment\nonly on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Company common stock as determined\nby the Delaware Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the\nperson.\nWhen the fair value of the shares of Company common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with interest\nthereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower\nthan, or the same as, the merger consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration\nto any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the relevant shares of Company common stock is less than the merger consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme\nCourt discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the\nnature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future\nprospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment\nor expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes not encompass known elements of value\u201d, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment\nor expectation.\nIn Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the\nDelaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person\u2019s\nexclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable in\nthe circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and\nexpert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and\nincurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses,\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n75\nTable of Contents\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company common\nstock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction\nunder Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nFrom and after the effective time, no person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote for any purpose\nany shares of Company common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for\ndividends or distributions payable to Company stockholders at a date prior to the effective time.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval\nmay be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application\nto the Court made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred\ntwenty (120) days after the effective time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled\nonly to the merger consideration under the merger agreement.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will\ngovern.",

The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to adopt the\nmerger agreement and to recommend that Company stockholders approve the merger agreement proposal.\nThe Company\u2019s executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Robert Bernshteyn (Chief Executive Officer, Director and Chair of the\nBoard), Anthony Tiscornia (Chief Financial Officer), Robert Glenn (Executive Vice President, Global Sales), Mark Riggs (Chief Customer Officer) and\nTodd Ford (former President, Finance and Operations). Mr. Ford transitioned to a non-executive role effective April 1, 2022 and continues to provide\ntransition and advisory services as an employee of the Company. The Company\u2019s directors for purposes of the discussion below are Michelle\nBrennan, Roger Siboni, Kanika Soni, Tayloe Stansbury, Scott Thompson, Frank Van Veenendaal and Leslie Campbell. Mrs. Campbell retired from the\nBoard as of the annual meeting of Company stockholders in 2022 and has no interests in the merger different from those interests of the Company\nshareholders generally.\nTreatment of Company Common Stock and Equity Awards\nFor information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of Company common stock by each of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers\nand all of such directors and executive officers as a group, please see the section entitled \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and\nManagement\u201d. Each of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each share of Company common stock he or she\nholds, the same per share merger consideration in cash in the same manner as other Company stockholders.\nCompany Options\nEach Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, vested (including any Company Option that vests automatically solely as a result of the\nmerger) and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,\nwithout interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such vested Company Option has not then been exercised\n \n \n76\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software IncorporatedTable of Contents\nmultiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of such vested Company Option, except that any vested\nCompany Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, as of the effective time, be canceled for\nno consideration.\nEach Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and\nreplaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock for which such\nunvested Company Option has not then been exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price\nof such unvested Company Option, which cash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the\nreplaced Company Option, subject to the holder\u2019s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its\nsubsidiaries), except that any unvested Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will,\nas of the effective time, be canceled for no consideration.\nCompany RSUs\nEach Company RSU that is unexpired, unsettled and vested (including any Company RSU that vests automatically solely as a result of the merger) or\nthat is deemed to be vested as described in the following sentence, in each case, outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, will be\ncanceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company common stock subject\nto such vested Company RSU or deemed vested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration.\nA percentage of each unvested Company RSU that was granted on or prior to December 11, 2022, is outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time and would have vested on or prior to January 31, 2024 (such Company RSU, a \u201cNear-Term Company RSU\u201d) will be accelerated and\ndeemed vested as of immediately prior to the effective time.\nThe percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that will be accelerated and deemed vested will be based on a ratio of $65 million to the total value\nof all shares of Company common stock underlying each Near-Term Company RSU, multiplied by the merger consideration. Based on the total value\nof all Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding as of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement) and\nassuming that no Near-Term Company RSUs vest or are forfeited following January 19, 2023, the percentage of each Near-Term Company RSU that\nwould be accelerated and deemed vested is equal to approximately 43%. The actual percentage of Near-Term Company RSUs that are accelerated and\ndeemed vested will not be known until the closing of the merger and will be based on the actual number of Near-Term Company RSUs outstanding at\nsuch time. Once the percentage described above has been calculated, it will be applied pro rata to each Near-Term Company RSU on each regularly\nscheduled vesting date between the closing date and January 31, 2024.\nEach Company RSU that remains unexpired, unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (other than any deemed vested\nCompany RSU described above) will be canceled and replaced with an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the number of shares of Company\ncommon stock subject to such unvested Company RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time, multiplied by the merger consideration, which\ncash amount will continue to vest on substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the replaced unvested Company RSU, subject to the\nholder\u2019s continued employment with Parent and its affiliates (including the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries).\nCompany PSUs\nEach Company PSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (or is otherwise described in the\nfollowing sentence) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the number of shares of\nCompany common stock subject to such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time (with such number of shares generally\ndetermined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of target performance and actual performance, with actual\nperformance determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), multiplied by the merger consideration, except that each\nCompany PSU granted to the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n77\nTable of Contents\non July 28, 2022 will be canceled for no consideration in accordance with its terms. In the event that a Company PSU granted on March 20, 2020 is\nforfeited prior to March 20, 2023 in accordance with its terms due to the failure to achieve the applicable performance-based vesting condition,\nsubject to the holder of each such forfeited Company PSU remaining employed by the Company through the effective time, such forfeited Company\nPSU will be treated as an outstanding Company PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time.\nAs of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement) and assuming that (1) all Company equity awards are\nvalued based on the merger consideration of $81.00 per share, and (2) the directors do not receive any Company equity awards or forfeit any\nCompany equity awards following January 19, 2023, each of the Company\u2019s current non-employee directors held 2,470 unvested Company RSUs\nwith a value of $200,070, which Company RSUs will accelerate and become vested immediately prior to the effective time pursuant to the Company\u2019s\ncompensation program for non-employee directors. None of the Company\u2019s current non-employee directors holds unvested Company Options or\nunvested Company PSUs. Mrs. Campbell, who is no longer a Company director, does not hold any Company equity awards.\nThe Company\u2019s executive officers hold vested Company Options, which are included in the section entitled \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain\nBeneficial Owners and Management\u201d, and unvested Company Options, all of which have an exercise price that is greater than the merger\nconsideration and will be canceled for no consideration. See \u201c\u2014 Quantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d below for the estimated value of the\nCompany RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of the Company\u2019s executive officers.\nCompany Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIf the effective time occurs prior to the end of any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP, all outstanding purchase rights under the\nCompany ESPP will automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, no later than five business days prior to the\neffective time and the Company ESPP will terminate at such time. Each share of Company common stock purchased on the final purchase date will be\ncanceled at the effective time and converted into the right to receive the same per share merger consideration in cash in the same manner as other\nCompany stockholders (less applicable tax withholding). The following table sets forth the estimated number of shares of Company common stock\nthat may be purchased under the Company ESPP assuming that each executive officer will purchase shares of Company common stock on March 15,\n2023 (the current purchase date under the Company ESPP) based on accumulated payroll deductions as of January 19, 2023 (the latest practicable\ndate before the filing of this proxy statement) at approximately $57.44 per share, which represents a 15% discount to the offering price as determined\nunder the Company ESPP, which is estimated to be $67.58 per share, and the estimated value of such shares of Company common stock based on the\nmerger consideration of $81.00 per share.\n \nExecutive Officer\nEstimated\nNumber\nof Shares\nof\nCompany\nCommon\nStock\nIssuable\nunder\nCompany\nESPP\nEstimated\nValue of\nShares of\nCompany\nCommon\nStock\nIssuable\nunder\nCompany\nESPP\nRob Bernshteyn\n371\n$\n30,051\nAnthony Tiscornia\n101\n$\n8,181\nRobert Glenn\n371\n$\n30,051\nMark Riggs\n157\n$\n12,717\nTodd Ford\n371\n$\n30,051\nFollowing the date the Company entered into the merger agreement, no new offering periods or purchase periods may be commenced pursuant to the\nCompany ESPP and no employees may newly participate in, or increase their contribution rates pursuant to, the Company ESPP.\nSeverance Entitlements\nSeverance and Change in Control Agreements\nEach executive officer is a party to an Amended and Restated Severance and Change in Control Agreement with the Company (each, a \u201cSeverance\nAgreement\u201d). Each Severance Agreement (other than Mr. Ford\u2019s Severance\n \n \n78\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\nAgreement, which is described below) provides that if the executive is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or the executive resigns for\n\u201cgood reason\u201d (as defined in the applicable Severance Agreement) (each, a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d), in each case within the period beginning three\nmonths prior to and ending 12 months following a change in control of the Company (the \u201cCIC Protection Period\u201d), such as the merger, the executive\nwould receive (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of the executive\u2019s base salary plus the executive\u2019s target annual bonus (or 18\nmonths\u2019 annual base salary plus 150% of target bonus for Mr. Bernshteyn) and (2) payment or reimbursement for the cost of continued health\ninsurance coverage for the executive and the executive\u2019s eligible dependents for up to 12 months (or up to 18 months for Mr. Bernshteyn). In\naddition, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, 100% of the unvested portion of each executive\u2019s outstanding Company\nequity awards would vest in full, and in the case of Company PSUs, performance would be deemed achieved at the greater of target performance and\nactual performance unless otherwise set forth in an applicable award agreement.\nEach of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is subject to the executive officer\u2019s execution of a general release of claims. In addition,\npursuant to their respective Severance Agreements, in the event that any payment or benefit payable to an executive officer would constitute a\nparachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), then the executive officer\nwould either receive all such payments and benefits in full or such payments and benefits would be reduced to the greatest amount that does not\ntrigger the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, whichever results in the greater after-tax amount for the executive officer.\nTransition Agreement and Severance Agreement with Mr. Ford\nIn connection with his transition to a non-executive role effective April 1, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Ford (the\n\u201cTransition Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Mr. Ford will continue to provide transition and advisory services as an employee of the Company for a\none-year term, which may be extended by mutual agreement. Pursuant to the Transition Agreement, upon the conclusion of Mr. Ford\u2019s transitional\nservices, Mr. Ford will be entitled to payment or reimbursement for the cost of continued health insurance coverage for him and his eligible\ndependents for up to six months, regardless of whether a change in control of the Company occurs. In addition, pursuant to Mr. Ford\u2019s Severance\nAgreement, he will automatically experience a Qualifying Termination on a change in control of the Company, such as the merger, and will be entitled\nto accelerated vesting of Company equity awards as described above. Mr. Ford is not eligible to participate in the Company\u2019s bonus program and is\nnot entitled to any cash severance under his Transition Agreement or his Severance Agreement.\nSee \u201c\u2014Quantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d below for the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits that may be become\npayable to the Company\u2019s executive officers.\nNew Management Arrangements\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers have entered into any agreement or engaged in discussions with Parent or any\nof its affiliates regarding employment or compensation arrangements with Parent and its affiliates on a going forward basis. Prior to or following the\nclosing of the merger, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with Parent or one of its affiliates\nregarding employment or compensation arrangements with Parent and its affiliates, but the merger is not conditioned upon any such agreements or\ndiscussions.\nParent and the Company have agreed that for the benefit of the Company\u2019s existing employees, including the Company\u2019s executive officers (other\nthan the Chief Executive Officer), the Company may grant up to 987,654 Company RSUs in fiscal year 2024 in the ordinary course of business as part\nof its annual fiscal performance review process and subject to the Company\u2019s standard award agreements. Any Company RSUs granted after entry\ninto the merger agreement that are unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time\n \n \nCoupa Software Incorporated\nNotice and Proxy Statement\n79\nTable of Contents\n(which we refer to as \u201cNewly Granted RSUs\u201d) will be treated in the same manner as all other unvested Company RSUs as described above, except no\nsuch Newly Granted RSUs will be subject to accelerated vesting (partial or otherwise) at the effective time other than in connection with a Qualifying\nTermination pursuant to the Severance Agreements.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and officers of the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification\nand coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies following the merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the\nmerger agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014\nIndemnification and Insurance\u201d.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers estimates of the\namounts of compensation that are payable in connection with or otherwise relate to the merger. The Company stockholders are being asked to\napprove, on a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be\nbinding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger agreement proposal is approved by the Company stockholders and\nthe merger is consummated, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to\nthe conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under \u201c\u2014Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors\nand Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (1) an\nassumption that the merger is consummated on March 31, 2023, (2) the per share merger consideration of $81.00, (3) the named executive officers\u2019\nsalary as in effect as of January 19, 2023, (4) the number of unvested Company equity awards held by the named executive officers as of January 19,\n2023 (the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement), and assuming no additional grants, vesting or forfeitures of Company\nequity awards will occur following January 19, 2023, and (5) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination of\nemployment immediately following the consummation of the merger under circumstances that entitle such named executive officer to receive\nseverance (i.e., a termination without \u201ccause\u201d or resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d).\nAs such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions\ndescribed in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger. As a\nresult, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers\n \nName\nSeverance\n($)(1)\nCompany Equity\nAwards ($)(2)\nPerquisites /\nBenefits ($)(3)\nTotal\n($)\nRob Bernshteyn\n2,100,000\n54,905,364\n57,000\n57,062,364\nAnthony Tiscornia\n640,000\n2,868,858\n36,000\n3,544,858\nRobert Glenn\n850,000\n4,911,111\n25,000\n5,786,111\nMark Riggs\n807,500\n5,327,046\n36,000\n6,170,546\nTodd Ford\n\u2014\n3,449,547\n\u2014\n3,449,547\n \n \n80\nNotice and Proxy Statement\nCoupa Software Incorporated\nTable of Contents\n \n(1)\nThe amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of the cash severance each named executive officer is eligible to receive upon\na Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. For Mr. Bernshteyn, the cash severance payment consists of an amount equal to 18\nmonths of his annual base salary, plus 150% of his target annual bonus, payable in a lump-sum. For Messrs. Tiscornia, Riggs and Glenn, the\ncash severance payment consists of an amount equal to 12 months of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary, plus 100% of his target bonus,\npayable in a lump-sum. Each such named executive officer\u2019s cash severance payment is a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payment, as it would only be\npayable in the event of a Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. Mr. Ford is not entitled to any cash severance payments.\n(2)\nThe amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of each named executive officer\u2019s unvested Company RSUs and\nunvested Company PSUs (assuming deemed achievement at target levels of performance) as further detailed in the table below. The estimated\npayments in respect of each named executive officer\u2019s Company RSUs that are accelerated and deemed vested as of immediately prior to the\neffective time and Company PSUs are \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payments, as such payments will be made shortly after the effective time regardless of\nwhether the executive officer experiences a Qualifying Termination within the CIC Protection Period. The estimated payments in respect of all\nother Company RSUs are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payments, which would only be payable subject to the named executive officer\u2019s Qualifying\nTermination within the CIC Protection Period (which, for Mr. Ford, will occur at the effective time). The estimated amounts shown in this\ncolumn do not include the value of Company PSUs granted to Mr. Bernshteyn on July 28, 2022, which will be canceled without consideration at\nthe effective time in accordance with their terms, and also do not include unvested Company Options, because all such Company Options held\nby the Company\u2019s named executive officers have an exercise price that is greater than the merger consideration of $81.00.

Until surrendered as\ncontemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right\nto receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.\n(c) Transfer Books\u037e No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company\nCommon Stock on the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have\nbeen paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry\nShares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers\non the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares are presented to\nthe Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.\n(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit (in\ncustomary form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if\nrequired by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any\nclaim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,\nthe applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as\ncontemplated by this Article II.\n \nA-4\nTable of Contents\n(e) Termination of Payment Fund. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be\nentitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that has not\nbeen disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving\nCorporation (as general unsecured creditors thereof) for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the\nMerger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time that would otherwise\nescheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its\ndesignee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.\n(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or\nthe Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other\nabandoned property, escheat or similar Law.\n(g) Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the\nMerger Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to Article II of this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and\nwithheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d), or under any provision of state, local or non-\nU.S. Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for\nall purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.\nSection 2.03 Company Equity Awards.

        "Section Text": "Annex B\n \nDecember 11, 2022\nBoard of Directors\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n1855 S. Grant Street\nSan Mateo, CA 94402\nMembers of the Board:\nWe understand that Coupa Software Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), Project CS Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany (\u201cParent\u201d), and Project CS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), plan to enter into\nan Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) dated as of December 11, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will\nmerge with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the\nMerger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare, of the Company (\u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) (other than (i) Appraisal Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) shares of\nCompany Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section 2.01(b) of the Merger Agreement) shall be canceled and converted\nautomatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $81.00, without interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The\nterms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated December 11, 2022 (the \u201cDraft Merger\nAgreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.\nWe have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial\ncondition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity\nfor Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock\nfor Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock\nwith that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly\navailable, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as\nwe have deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information\nthat was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections,\nwe have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of\n \nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-1Table of Contents\n \nDirectors of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nmanagement of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the\nCompany Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ\nmaterially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of\nthe proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the\ncontemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we\nhave relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and\nproducts of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which will\nbecome payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has\nagreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date\nhereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P. or Parent pursuant to which\ncompensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and\nother financial services to the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P. or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.\nQatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from\nwhich conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short\npositions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Thoma Bravo, L.P., Parent or certain of their\nrespective affiliates.\nThis opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the\nBoard of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a\nrecommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company\nCommon Stock will trade at any time.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of,\nthe date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any\nobligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the\nMerger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to\n \nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-2\nTable of Contents\n \nany of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.\nBased on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders\npursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\n \nYours faithfully,\n/s/ Qatalyst Partners LP\nQatalyst Partners LP\n \nOne Maritime Plaza | 24th Floor | San Francisco, CA 94111\nTel: 415.844.7700 | www.qatalyst.com | Fax: 415.391.3914\nB-3\nTable of Contents\nAnnex C",
