Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including\nthe merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the\nAntitrust Division (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) of the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and the\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been\nsatisfied. Buyer and Echo filed their Premerger Notification and Report Forms on September 23, 2021, in\nconnection with the merger, and the waiting period will therefore expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on October 25, 2021.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the\nHSR Act.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (page 58)\nOn October 12, 2021, two lawsuits related to the merger were filed against the Company and its directors.

These questions and answers may not\naddress all of the questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to\nthe more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy\nstatement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you\nshould read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into\nthis proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled \u201cWhere You\nCan Find Additional Information.\u201d\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn September 9, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a\ndirect and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving\nthe merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The merger agreement provides for the Buyer to\nacquire the Company in a merger for a price of $48.25 per share in cash, without interest. You are\nreceiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company\u2019s Board in\nfavor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and to approve the other related proposals to be\nvoted on at the Special Meeting.\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nThe Special Meeting will be held virtually, on November 19, 2021, at 9:00 a.m. CT (including any\nadjournment or postponement thereof). This Special Meeting will be a virtual meeting conducted solely\nonline. You will be able to attend the Special Meeting online by logging in at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECHO2021SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting\nin person.\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nOnly holders of record of the Company common stock as of the close of business on October 20, 2021,\nthe record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their\nshares at the Special Meeting. Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding as of the\nclose of business on the record date will be entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to a vote\nat the Special Meeting.\nWhat matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?\nYou will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\nto approve the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the\nCompany and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer\u037e\nto approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and\nto approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to\nsolicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger\nagreement or in the absence of a quorum.\nMay I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?\nAs the Special Meeting is being conducted via an audio webcast, there is no physical meeting location.\nTo attend the Special Meeting, log in at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECHO2021SM. You will\nneed your unique control number included on your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied\nyour proxy materials. We recommend that you log in a few minutes before the meeting to ensure you are\nlogged in when the meeting starts. If you encounter any technical difficulties accessing the virtual\nmeeting, a toll-free number will be available to assist.\nIf your shares are held through a broker, trustee or other nominee, it is likely that they are registered in\nthe name of the nominee, and you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name.

Your broker, trustee or other nominee has provided a voting\ninstruction card for you to use in directing how your shares are to be voted. As a beneficial owner, you\nwill need to obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from our broker, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares online\nduring the virtual Special Meeting. If you lose your control number, you may join the Special Meeting\nas a \u201cGuest\u201d or by dialing 1-877-328-2502 (toll free) or 1-412-317-5419 (International Dial in) and\nreferencing \u201cEcho\u201d but you will not be able to vote, ask questions or access the list of stockholders as\nof the record date.\nWhy did we choose to hold a virtual Special Meeting?\nOur Board decided to hold the Special Meeting virtually in response to public health concerns over\nlarge gatherings of people in order to help limit potential transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, our\nexperience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and stockholder\nparticipation can be well served by the virtual format.\nHow many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\nA quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of\nthe Company issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are present virtually or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the holders of a majority of the\nshares present in person or presented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote at the meeting, may\nadjourn the meeting to another time and/or place.\nAs of the close of business on October 20, 2021, the record date for the Special Meeting, there were\n26,630,895 shares of common stock outstanding.\nIf you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on\nthe proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present\nat the Special Meeting.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve the merger agreement?\nApproval of the merger agreement requires the vote of a majority of the shares of common stock\noutstanding at the close of business on the record date for the Special Meeting \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\napprove the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from\nvoting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement. If\nyour shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the\nnominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted upon at the Special\nMeeting?\nEach of the advisory (non-binding) proposals to approve certain compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the\nproposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional\nproxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\nshares of our common stock present, in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting.\nAn abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock\n(including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d these proposals. Because all proposals for the Special Meeting are\nnon-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes for such proposals.\nHow does the Company\u2019s Board recommend that I vote?\nOur Board unanimously recommends that Echo stockholders vote:\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement\u037e\n16 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cFOR\u201d the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to the named executive officers of Echo in connection with the merger\u037e and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Company\u2019s Board considered in determining to recommend the\napproval of the merger agreement, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u202f-\u202fReasons\nfor the Merger\u037e Recommendation of Echo\u2019s Board.\u201d In addition, in considering the recommendation of\nour Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and\nexecutive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company\nstockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\n(Proposal 1)\u202f-\u202fInterests of Echo\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nHow do Echo\u2019s directors and officers intend to vote?\nWe currently expect that Echo\u2019s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the\nproposal to approve the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the Special\nMeeting, although they have no obligation to do so.\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\nAs of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger during the second\nhalf of calendar year 2021. However, completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of\nthe conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described in this proxy statement and include\nregulatory clearances, and it is possible that the merger will not be completed until a later time, or at all.\nThere may be a substantial amount of time between the Special Meeting and the completion of the\nmerger. After the requisite vote is obtained, our Board will not have the right to terminate the merger\nagreement in order to accept any alternative acquisition proposal. We expect to complete the merger\npromptly after the requisite vote is obtained and all required regulatory clearances have been received.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nIf the merger agreement is not approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders, or if the merger is not\ncompleted for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of\ncommon stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Echo will remain a public company, and shares of\nour common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on\nthe Nasdaq. In the event that the Company fails to promptly pay the company termination fee or the\nBuyer fails to promptly pay the buyer termination fee, and in order to obtain such payment, the Buyer,\non the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a legal proceeding that results in a\njudgment against the Company for the company termination fee, or any portion thereof, as applicable,\nthe Company shall pay the Buyer, or the Buyer shall pay the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-\npocket costs and expenses (including attorney\u2019s fees) in connection with such legal proceeding\n(including interests) (the amounts referred to in the foregoing, the \u201cCollection Costs\u201d)\u037e provided, that in\nno event shall the Collection Costs exceed $10,000,000.\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?\nWe urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and\nthe documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger\naffects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own.\nVoting Virtually\nStockholders of record will be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of\nrecord, but instead hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other\nnominee, you must provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in\norder to be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting.\n17 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIt is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of\ncommon stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions\npromptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually.\nAttending the meeting virtually does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can also ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy via:\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed\npostage-paid envelope\u037e\ntelephone, by viewing the proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com and using a touch-tone phone\nand the toll-free number 1-800-690-6903\u037e or\nthe Internet, at www.proxyvote.com and the 12-digit control number on the enclosed proxy card.\nThe telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. ET on\nNovember 18, 2021.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a\nproposal, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d  (1) the proposal to approve the merger agreement, (2) the advisory\n(non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the\nCompany\u2019s the named executive officers in connection with the merger, and (3) the proposal to approve on or\nmore adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies\nif there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the\nmerger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve\nthe merger agreement and on the other two proposals (assuming, in the case of a failure to vote, that a\nquorum is present).\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the\ndirections provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or\nother nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the\nproposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in\nconnection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate,\nincluding to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to\napprove the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying Echo at Echo Global Logistics, Inc., 600\nWest Chicago Avenue, Suite 725, Chicago, IL 60654, Attention: Zach Jecklin, or by submitting a new\nproxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the\nenclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke\nyour proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting virtually\u037e however, simply attending the\nSpecial Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should\ninstead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior\nvoting instructions. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by\nvoting virtually at the Special Meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker,\nbank or other nominee in order to be able to vote virtually at the Special Meeting.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nThe requisite number of shares to approve each of the proposal to approve the merger agreement is\nbased on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the\nshares that are voted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to approve the merger\nagreement and the other two proposals, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each such\nproposal.\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nThe inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d)\u037e however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and\nthe vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not be binding on Echo or Buyer.\nIf the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-\nrelated compensation may be paid to our named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their\ncompensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nWill my shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for\nvoting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nNo. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a\ndifferent stockholder (that is, your custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of\ncommon stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own\nshares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a\ntrust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card\nfor those shares of common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares\nof common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the\nentity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of common\nstock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nThis means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, you should read carefully\nany proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nIf your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will\nreceive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards\nand voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet)\nto ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through\ncompletion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion\nof the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion of\nthe merger. If you transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the closing of\nthe merger, you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the merger\nconsideration.\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nNo. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the\npaying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common\nstock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are\nheld in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your\n19 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbroker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your\n\u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your stock certificates now.\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the per share merger consideration for my shares\nof common stock?\nYes. As a holder of Echo common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, in\nconnection with the merger if you take certain actions, meet certain conditions and fully comply with the\nrequirements set forth under the DGCL, including that you do not vote (virtually or by proxy) in favor of\nadoption of the merger agreement. These procedures are summarized in the section entitled \u201cAppraisal\nRights of Echo Stockholders.\u201d In addition, the text of the applicable appraisal rights provisions of\nDelaware law is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to strictly comply\nwith these provisions will result in the loss of dissenters\u2019 rights.\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or\nmore stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company\nprovides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to\nreceive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted\nhouseholding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has\nmultiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification\nfrom your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional\ncopies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy\nstatement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your\ndecision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nWhere can I find more information about Echo?\nYou can find more information about Echo from various sources described in the section entitled \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nIf you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting\nyour shares or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact\nD.F.

This summary does not purport to be complete\nand may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You are encouraged\nto read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.\nCertain Effects of the Merger\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is approved by Echo\u2019s stockholders\nand the other conditions to the closing of the merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with\nand into Echo, with Echo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.\nand into Echo, with Echo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of\ncommon stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than (1) shares owned by\nBuyer, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer and shares owned by Echo or any wholly\nowned subsidiary of Echo, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, (2) shares owned by\nstockholders of Echo who have complied with the applicable provisions of the DGCL prior to the effective\ntime and (3) Echo restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares (which will be converted as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Equity Awards\u201d)) will be\nconverted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $48.25 per share in cash, without interest.\nBuyer, Echo, Merger Sub, and the paying agent for the merger consideration will each be entitled to deduct\nand withhold any amounts due under applicable tax laws from the amounts that would otherwise be payable\nunder the terms of the merger agreement.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the symbol \u201cECHO.\u201d As a result of the merger, Echo will cease to be a publicly traded company and\nwill be indirectly wholly owned by Buyer. Following the completion of the merger, Echo common stock will be\ndelisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Echo will no longer be required to\nfile periodic reports with the SEC with respect to its common stock in accordance with applicable law, rules\nand regulations.\nBackground to the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key events that led to the signing of the merger agreement and\ndoes not purport to catalogue every conversation, nor the details of every conversation, involving the\nBoard, management or other representatives of the Company and other parties. Other than as described\nbelow and for contacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no material contacts between\nEcho and TJC in the two years preceding the signing of the merger agreement and TJC was not involved in\nthe 2016 Process or the 2019 Process (each as defined and discussed further below).\nThe Board and Echo\u2019s management regularly evaluate and consider Echo\u2019s historical performance, future\ngrowth prospects, overall strategic goals and objectives and various opportunities to enhance stockholder\nvalue, as well as industry conditions and development. As part of this ongoing evaluation process, Echo\nfrom time to time evaluates potential transactions that would further its strategic objectives.\nThe Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These potential strategic\nalternatives have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, Echo\u2019s\ncurrent business plan, with Echo remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) the investment in, and development\nof, new business lines and services\u037e (3) capital raising activities\u037e (4) potential expansion opportunities\nthrough acquisitions, partnership or other commercial relationships\u037e and (5) business combinations,\nacquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of Echo. While the Board\nregularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening our\nbusiness and enhancing stockholder value, Echo\u2019s receipt of unsolicited indications of interest in\ntransactions involving the potential sale of the Company have resulted in Echo\u2019s focused exploration of a\npotential sale through two processes in recent years (neither of which identified any actionable offers, as\ndescribed in further detail below).\n27 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn August of 2016, Echo received an unsolicited inquiry from a strategic party inquiring about Echo\u2019s interest\nin a sale of Echo. Thereafter, Morgan Stanley was retained by Echo to serve as the financial advisor to Echo.\nAt the time of its engagement, Morgan Stanley was well known to Echo and Echo management in light of\npast work performed on behalf of Echo and Morgan Stanley\u2019s experience in transactions similar to the one\nproposed, qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the Company and its business and\nthe industries in which the Company conducts its business. Under the direction of the Board, 21 strategic\nparties and 11 financial parties were contacted in September of 2016 in order to explore a potential\ntransaction (the \u201c2016 Process\u201d). Overall, 14 parties signed non-disclosure agreements and 12 parties\n(including the strategic party whose unsolicited inquiry led to the 2016 Process) received management\npresentations during the fall of 2016. Ultimately, no party submitted an indication of interest and the process\nwas terminated in early 2017.\nDuring June and July 2019, Echo received written, unsolicited and non-binding indications of interest from\nthree financial sponsors, including a portfolio company of one such sponsor, offering to purchase the\nCompany at prices ranging from $22.50 to $25.00 per share. The letters containing such indications of interest\nwere addressed to Mr. Waggoner and Mr. Waggoner, in turn, promptly shared such letters with the Board.\nIn July 2019, at the direction of the Board and in response to these indications of interest, Echo engaged\nMorgan Stanley as its financial advisor and initiated a process to consider strategic alternatives, including a\npotential sale of the Company (the \u201c2019 Process\u201d). At the time of its engagement in connection with the\n2019 Process, Morgan Stanley was well known to Echo and Echo management due to, among other things,\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s familiarity with Echo resulting from its engagement in connection with the 2016 Process\nand the other factors enumerated previously. In connection with the 2019 Process, at the direction of the\nBoard, Morgan Stanley gauged the interest of a number of financial sponsors and strategic parties, including\none such party that subsequently re-emerged in 2021 as a bidder to acquire Echo (which party we refer to as\n\u201cStrategic A\u201d).\nIn connection with the 2019 Process, Echo received nine non-binding indications of interest, of which three\nwere from strategic parties, including Strategic A, and six were from financial sponsors. The indications of\ninterest contemplated prices per share ranging from $24.00 to $28.64. Eight parties, including all three\nstrategic parties and five financial sponsors, were invited to participate in due diligence and asked to submit\nupdated proposals. None of those parties submitted a final proposal and all such parties withdrew from the\nprocess. In late 2019, Echo formally concluded the process and terminated its engagement of Morgan\nStanley.\nIn early 2020, the Board directed that management provide an assessment of the Company\u2019s competitive\nposition within the logistics industry and develop strategic initiatives to enhance such position. As part of\nconducting this assessment, the Board, together with management, focused on organic operational\nenhancements to our business plan that would be most likely to enhance stockholder value. As a result of\nthis process, Echo adopted the strategic objectives to (i) gain market share, (ii) grow EBITDA more than net\nrevenue, (iii) provide industry leading service to shippers and carriers and (iv) create enhanced profitability\nthrough technology and automation. Thereafter, Echo commenced various operating initiatives designed to\npromote these strategic objectives, including further digitizing and automating the pricing, sourcing, load\nmanagement and tracking systems on Echo\u2019s platform, driving growth of its brokerage business through\nimproved sourcing, competitive pricing, client acquisitions and restructured employee incentives, integrating\ntechnology and business processes to improve speed to market and functionality of its internal and external\ntechnology releases and expanding its managed transportation business through improved product offerings\nand service.\nImplementing these operating initiatives, navigating the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding the shift to remote work for substantially all of its employees, and seeking to capitalize on\nfavorable freight market opportunities and dynamics that began to emerge in the second quarter of 2020 and\ncontinued in 2021, the Company produced record operating results in 2020 and during the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2021, and raised its full year guidance in a press release dated April 28, 2021, announcing first\nquarter results for 2021.\nOn June 15, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a call from Renee Krug, an operating partner of TJC. TJC did not\nparticipate in the 2016 Process or the 2019 Process. Ms. Krug asked if Mr. Waggoner would be open\n28 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto a conversation to discuss a potential transaction between TJC and Echo. Mr. Waggoner agreed to a call,\nwhich was set for June 17, 2021.\nAlso on June 15, 2021, Mr. Waggoner contacted Echo\u2019s outside counsel, Winston & Strawn LLP\n(\u201cWinston\u201d), and Mr. Skinner, lead independent director of the Board, to discuss the outreach received from\nTJC. Mr. Waggoner was instructed to inform TJC that, if it wished to pursue a potential transaction with the\nCompany, it should submit a letter to the Board expressing such interest. Mr. Waggoner also agreed to\nprovide an update to both Winston and Mr. Skinner following the June 17, 2021 call with TJC.\nOn June 17, 2021, Mr. Waggoner participated in a call with Brian Higgins, Peter Suffredini and Renee Krug of\nTJC. Mr. Higgins asked Mr. Waggoner if Echo would be open to discussing a \u201ctake-private\u201d transaction and\nsolicited Mr. Waggoner\u2019s opinion on the most appropriate next steps in order to proceed with such a\ntransaction. Mr. Waggoner responded that the first step would be for TJC to submit a letter to the Board\nconfirming TJC\u2019s interest in Echo. Mr. Waggoner added that as Echo is a reporting company, TJC should\nhave access to sufficient publicly available information to enable it to develop an informed view on valuation\nand that such view should be included in TJC\u2019s letter to the Board. Finally, Mr. Waggoner indicated that if\nthe Board found TJC\u2019s letter compelling, the parties could enter into a non-disclosure agreement and,\nthereafter, engage in further discussions. Following the call, Mr. Waggoner provided a summary of the\ndiscussion with TJC to Winston and Mr. Skinner.\nOn June 24, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a letter from TJC (the \u201cTJC Indication of Interest\u201d) addressed to\nthe Board reflecting TJC\u2019s non-binding interest in acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of Echo for\ncash consideration of $40.00 per share, which reflected a 26.8% premium to the closing price of $31.55 on\nJune 23, 2021 and a 9.4% premium to the then all-time high closing share price of $36.56 on May 5, 2021. The\nTJC Indication of Interest did not request that Echo enter into exclusivity with TJC. Mr. Waggoner forwarded\na copy of the TJC Indication of Interest to the Board and scheduled a special meeting of the Board for the\nnext day, June 25, 2021, to consider the TJC Indication of Interest.\nOn June 25, 2021, the Board met and discussed both the TJC Indication of Interest and the major strategic\nalternatives available to Echo, including the continuation of Echo\u2019s business plan with Echo remaining an\nindependent company. Following this discussion, the Board concluded that the transaction contemplated by\nthe TJC Indication of Interest warranted further consideration. The Board also discussed the need to engage\na financial advisor to assist in such consideration and directed management to explore a potential\nengagement of Morgan Stanley due to, among other things, Morgan Stanley\u2019s familiarity with Echo resulting\nfrom its engagement in connection with the 2016 Process and the 2019 Process. The Board also directed\nmanagement to update its five-year plan to assist the Board in assessing the proposal from TJC and other\npotential strategic alternatives.\nPromptly following the meeting of the Board, Mr. Waggoner and Winston contacted Morgan Stanley to\ndiscuss, subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between the parties, the potential engagement of\nMorgan Stanley as a financial advisor in connection with the exploration of a potential strategic transaction\nwith TJC or other interested parties.\nOn June 30, 2021, Morgan Stanley sent a draft engagement letter to Winston and discussions ensued with\nMorgan Stanley, Winston, and Echo on the terms of Morgan Stanley\u2019s potential engagement. Morgan\nStanley also met with management of Echo to discuss a potential process and the management plan being\nprepared for the Board.\nOn July 1, 2021, Mr. Waggoner sent an email to TJC confirming that the Board was considering its proposal\nand would provide a further update following that consideration.\nOn July 6, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a text message from the president and chief executive officer of\nStrategic A (such officer of Strategic A, \u201cCEO A\u201d). In this text message, CEO A indicated he would be in\nChicago, Illinois on July 19, 2021, and invited Mr. Waggoner to dinner. Mr. Waggoner accepted the invitation\nand promptly advised Winston, Morgan Stanley, and Mr. Skinner of this contact.\nOn July 8, 2021, Mr. Waggoner participated in a call with Mr. Higgins and told him that Echo had held a\nBoard meeting and had begun the process of engaging a financial advisor.\n29 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 14, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was convened with Morgan Stanley and Winston in\nattendance. Mr. Waggoner updated the Board on the contact from CEO A and the planned dinner on July 19,\n2021. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided certain financial analysis and discussed the TJC\nIndication of Interest. As part of this discussion, the Morgan Stanley representatives provided certain\nbackground information on TJC, including TJC\u2019s experience in the freight and logistics industry, and noted\nthat Strategic A might be interested in an acquisition of Echo. The Board discussed next steps and\nconcluded that enlarging the process by approaching other potential buyers risked jeopardizing the serious\nand credible interest demonstrated by TJC and the potential that Strategic A would also emerge as a serious\nand credible bidder in the process. The Board also reviewed the preliminary management plan presented by\nEcho\u2019s management and directed management to update the plan to reflect opportunities presented by\nevolving market conditions and the impact of planned operating and technology initiatives. Winston then\nprovided an overview of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of a potential\nstrategic transaction. Winston also reviewed guidelines that had been utilized previously in the 2016 Process\nand the 2019 Process, which directed that management, including Mr. Waggoner, not engage in discussions\nwith any bidder concerning post-closing compensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted by\nthe Board. Finally, the Board reviewed the proposed terms of the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley and\napproved the retention of Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor pursuant to such terms. Following the\nmeeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted TJC to inform them that the Board had determined to\nprovide TJC with access to non-public business and financial information in order to allow TJC to improve\nupon its proposal. During that call, the Morgan Stanley representatives also discussed the transaction\nprocess, including the negotiation and execution of a non-disclosure agreement, a request that TJC develop\na list of diligence issues key to improving its valuation of Echo and the expectation that the financial model\nincluded in Echo\u2019s management plan would be made available after TJC\u2019s execution of a non-disclosure\nagreement. The Morgan Stanley representatives then briefed Mr. Waggoner on Morgan Stanley\u2019s discussion\nwith TJC and Mr. Waggoner, in turn, sent an email to the members of the Board summarizing the update\nprovided by Morgan Stanley and outlining next steps with respect to the consideration of a potential\ntransaction.\nOn July 15, 2021, Winston, through Morgan Stanley, sent a Form of Non-Disclosure Agreement to TJC. The\nparties exchanged drafts of such agreement and a non-disclosure agreement between the Company and TJC\nwas signed on July 22, 2021.\nOn July 19, 2021, Mr. Waggoner had dinner with CEO A in Chicago, Illinois. During the course of that dinner,\nCEO A indicated that Strategic A was interested in pursuing strategic transactions with complementary\nbusinesses and that Echo was a potential acquisition target. Mr. Waggoner and CEO A also discussed\nStrategic A\u2019s involvement in the 2019 Process. Although no details of a potential transaction between Echo\nand Strategic A were discussed at this dinner, Mr. Waggoner did indicate to CEO A that if Strategic A was, in\nfact, interested in pursuing a transaction with Echo it would be advisable for Strategic A to act promptly.\nOn July 20, 2021, Mr. Waggoner provided an update to each of Mr. Skinner and Winston on his dinner and\ndiscussion with CEO A.\nA special meeting of Echo\u2019s Board was held on July 23, 2021, at which representatives of Morgan Stanley\nand Winston were in attendance. At this meeting, Mr. Waggoner updated the full board on his dinner and\ndiscussion with CEO A. The Board also reviewed and approved an updated management plan, including the\nfive-year model contemplated thereby.\nTJC and its counsel were provided with the approved management plan on July 23, 2021 and access to the\nvirtual data room containing business and legal diligence materials on July 27, 2021.\nA regular meeting of the Board was held on July 30, 2021. At this meeting, Mr. Waggoner provided an update\non the strategic process, noting that TJC had commenced its diligence and that an in-person management\nand technology presentations with TJC were scheduled for August 5, 2021 and August 10, 2021,\nrespectively. Mr. Waggoner also noted that he had not had further contact with CEO A.\nOn the evening of August 4, 2021, representatives of TJC, Morgan Stanley and Echo had dinner together in\nChicago, Illinois. On August 5, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo, and Morgan Stanley\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nattended an in-person management presentation at Echo\u2019s offices in Chicago, Illinois with representatives of\nTJC\u2019s financial advisor participating virtually.\nOn August 9, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo and Morgan Stanley participated in a call to discuss Echo\u2019s\nfinancial model.\nOn August 10, 2021, representatives of TJC, Echo and Morgan Stanley attended a virtual presentation on\nEcho\u2019s technology.\nFollowing the technology presentation, representatives of Morgan Stanley asked that TJC provide an\nupdated perspective on value and confirm its interest in pursuing a transaction. On August 12, 2021, TJC\nconfirmed it remained interested in pursuing a transaction at a price of $40.00 per share. TJC further indicated\nit would not unilaterally propose an increase to such price but would respond to a counter proposal from\nEcho.\nOn August 11, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a telephone call from CEO A. During that call, CEO A indicated\nthat Strategic A would like to make an offer to buy Echo and asked Mr. Waggoner for his views on the\nappropriate steps to proceed with such an offer. Mr. Waggoner told CEO A that Strategic A would need to\nsubmit a letter to the Board indicating Strategic A\u2019s interest with specific detail on valuation and an expected\ntimeline for the proposed transaction.\nOn August 12, 2021, Mr. Waggoner sent an e-mail to the Board providing a summary of his conversation with\nCEO A and an update on the status of discussions with TJC, including the feedback that TJC provided\nMorgan Stanley on price. In anticipation of receiving a written indication of interest from Strategic A, Mr.\nWaggoner also scheduled a special meeting of the Board for August 16, 2021.\nOn August 16, 2021, Mr. Waggoner received a letter from Strategic A reflecting its interest in purchasing\nEcho at a valuation ranging from $44.00\u202f-\u202f$47.00 per share, with the consideration payable in cash. In the\nletter, Strategic A indicated it would be able to complete its diligence and be in position to enter into\ndefinitive agreement within three to four weeks. The letter also stated that Strategic A\u2019s proposal would be\nwithdrawn on August 18, 2021, unless Strategic A was granted exclusivity. Mr. Waggoner forwarded a copy\nof the letter to the Board in advance of the previously scheduled special meeting of the Board.\nAt the special meeting of the Board on August 16, 2021, the Board, with representatives of Morgan Stanley\nand Winston in attendance, reviewed the key terms of a proposed draft of the merger agreement that was\ncontemplated to be sent to TJC and, if applicable, Strategic A. As part of this discussion, the Board also\nreviewed the treatment of incentive equity awards that, under the draft merger agreement, were contemplated\nto be accelerated. The Board also reviewed the letter received from Strategic A, including the request for\nexclusivity, and discussed the strategy for engaging with TJC and Strategic A in a manner designed to\nmaximize value for Echo\u2019s stockholders. The Board emphasized to Echo\u2019s management and advisors the\nimportance of maintaining competitive tension by keeping both parties engaged and the objective of\nstructuring the process in a manner that positioned each party to present to the Board at approximately the\nsame time fully negotiated, best and final terms that were not subject to any further diligence.\nFollowing the meeting, and at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised\nStrategic A that Echo was willing to engage in discussions concerning a potential transaction and, subject to\nexecution of a mutually acceptable non-disclosure agreement, to provide further information in connection\nwith the process. At the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley also advised Strategic A\nthat Echo was not in a position to grant Strategic A exclusivity and that it would be advisable for Strategic A\nto proceed with requisite diligence as expeditiously as possible and prepare to submit a final bid in the first\nweek of September 2021. Later that day, a form of non-disclosure agreement was provided to Strategic A\nthrough Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also advised TJC, at the direction of the Board,\nthat Echo was not prepared to provide a counter proposal but was willing to proceed with due diligence with\nthe guidance that TJC would have to improve its price in its final bid. The Morgan Stanley representatives\ndiscussed the transaction process, including that Winston would share a draft of the merger agreement and\nwould expect TJC to provide a markup and submit a final bid in the first week of September 2021.\n31 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 17, 2021, a non-disclosure agreement with Strategic A was signed. The non-disclosure agreement\nwas consistent with the terms of the non-disclosure agreement executed by Strategic A in connection with\nthe 2019 Process. This non-disclosure agreement included a standstill provision that terminated upon the\nentry by Echo into definitive agreements with respect to certain transactions, including a sale of 50% or more\nof the voting power of Echo. In connection with the execution of the non-disclosure agreement, Strategic A\nconfirmed that, subject to protocols designed to limit disclosure of competitively sensitive information, it\nwould engage a third-party consultant to complete an analysis of customer and carrier overlap between Echo\nand Strategic A similar to the analysis undertaken by Strategic A in the 2019 Process.\nOn August 19, 2021, Strategic A and its counsel were provided access to the virtual data room containing\nbusiness and legal diligence materials and Winston provided a draft of the merger agreement to counsel for\nTJC and Strategic A, respectively, with the request that comments be provided in the form of detailed written\nmark-ups by August 27, 2021. Key features of these first drafts of the merger agreement that were delivered\nto TJC and Strategic A included the following:\nThe draft merger agreement provided to TJC was tailored to reflect TJC\u2019s status as a financial\nsponsor, including in order to contemplate customary representations and warranties on financing\ncommitment letters, the delivery by TJC of a limited guaranty, debt financing covenants and a reverse\ntermination fee of 6.0% of the equity value of the transaction that would be payable, as a non-\nexclusive remedy, in the event of a debt financing failure by TJC\u2019s lenders\u037e\nThe draft merger agreement delivered to each party contemplated a provision, commonly referred to\nas a \u201chell or high water\u201d covenant, pursuant to which the purchaser was required to take any and all\nsteps to avoid or eliminate each and every objection to the transaction that might be asserted by a\ngovernmental authority under applicable antitrust laws\u037e and\nThe draft merger agreement delivered to each party contemplated a termination fee of 2.0% of the\nequity value of the transaction payable by Echo in the event Echo terminated the merger agreement in\norder to enter into a superior proposal or the Board made a change in recommendation and, following\ntermination by either party as a result of such change in recommendation, entered into an acquisition\nproposal within a tail period following such termination.\nOn August 20, 2021, a draft clean team agreement relating to the proposed overlap analysis was sent to\nStrategic A. Discussions ensued and on August 22, 2021, a clean team agreement among Echo, Strategic A\nand the third-party consultant engaged by Strategic A to conduct the overlap analysis was executed.\nSubsequently, customer and carrier information was independently provided to the third-party consultant by\neach of Strategic A and Echo.\nOn August 24, 2021, representatives of Strategic A (including representatives from the financial advisor\nretained by Strategic A), Echo and Morgan Stanley met in the Chicago offices of Winston to attend a\nmanagement presentation and to conduct in-person diligence on Echo\u2019s business, strategy, and operations.\nOn August 26, 2021, TJC\u2019s counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d) provided Winston with a detailed\nmarkup on the draft merger agreement.

These comments included, among other things, the following:\nRequired certain stockholders of Echo, including Echo\u2019s directors, to enter into voting agreements at\nsigning in order to support the transaction\u037e\nRejected the \u201chell or high water\u201d covenant requested by Echo, including by specifically limiting\nStrategic A\u2019s obligations in connection with securing antitrust approvals for the transaction\u037e\nIntroduced language that Strategic A would control and lead all communications and strategy in\nconnection with seeking antitrust approvals\u037e\nIncreased the company termination fee from 2% of the equity value of the transaction to 4% of the\nenterprise value of the transaction\u037e and\nReduced the general outside date from nine months to six months (but maintained the extension to\ntwelve months in the event all conditions were satisfied other than antitrust approvals having been\nobtained).\nOn August 30, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, in the course of a discussion with TJC on the\nprocess and next steps, and at the direction of the Board, confirmed that another party was involved in the\nprocess, was operating on substantially the same timeline as TJC and had indicated a purchase price that\nwas superior to the $40.00 offered by TJC. The Morgan Stanley representatives noted that TJC would have\nthe opportunity to increase its offer in presenting its final proposal to the Board.\nA special meeting of the Board was held on September 1, 2021. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nWinston attended the meeting. During the meeting, the Morgan Stanley representatives provided an update\non the process, including a summary of its discussion with TJC relating to the involvement of another party\nin the process. Winston reviewed key terms in the merger agreement, including issues raised in the\nrespective mark-ups. At this time, the Board also discussed the potential need to implement retention\narrangements in order to minimize disruption to Echo\u2019s business in the event of a transaction announcement.\nDuring the course of this discussion, in light of Echo\u2019s performance in 2021 and the substantial likelihood\nthat participants in Echo\u2019s equity incentive plan would achieve maximum permitted bonuses under such plan\nbased on such performance, the Board discussed and approved introducing into the draft merger agreement\na requirement that the acquirer agree that executives participating in such plan would receive, subject to\ncontinued employment through December 31, 2021, a bonus for 2021 of not less than the maximum bonus\namount permitted under the annual incentive plan Following the meeting, and at the direction of the Board,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley advised TJC and Strategic A that their final proposals, together with final\ncomments on the merger agreement, should be presented by 5:00 p.m. CT, on Tuesday, September 7, 2021. A\nspecial meeting of the Board was set for September 8, 2021, to review proposals.\nOn September 1, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland. The comments in\nthe revised draft of the merger agreement included, among other things, the following:\nA reduction of the requested marketing period from 60 days to 45 days\u037e\nA decrease of the requested termination fee of 3.75% of the equity value of the transaction to 2.5% of\nthe equity value of the transaction\u037e\nA rejection of the request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder\napproval for the transaction\u037e\nAn acceptance of the reverse termination fee as the sole and exclusive monetary remedy in the event\nof a debt financing failure, but subject to an additional expense and interest recovery in the event the\nreverse termination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due\u037e and\nProvided for a general outside date of six months (extendable to nine months in the event all\nconditions were satisfied other than antitrust approvals having been obtained).\n33 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 2, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of merger agreement to Strategic A\u2019s counsel. The\ncomments in the revised draft of the merger agreement included, among other things, the following:\nA rejection of the request for voting agreements to be delivered by stockholders of Echo at signing\u037e\nA reinstatement of the \u201chell or high water\u201d covenant\u037e\nA rejection of the language that would defer to Strategic A to control and lead all communications and\nstrategy in connection with seeking antitrust approvals\u037e and\nA decrease of the requested company termination fee of 4% of the enterprise value of the transaction\nto 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction.\nLater on the same day, Winston also sent Kirkland written comments on the draft equity commitment letter\nand limited guaranty.\nOn September 2, 2021, a report on the overlap analysis conducted by the third-party consultant was\nprovided to Echo and Strategic A, respectively, under the terms of the clean term agreement.\nOn September 3, 2021, Winston held a call with Kirkland in order to discuss process and next steps. On this\ncall, Kirkland asked if Winston would be willing to review a further revised draft of the merger agreement\nprior to the final bid submission and, thereafter, provide feedback on the draft in order to permit TJC to\nfurther improve its bid based on guidance from Winston. Winston confirmed its willingness to review a\nfurther revised draft of the merger agreement and provide such feedback to Kirkland.\nLater on the same day, Winston reached out to Strategic A\u2019s counsel in order to extend to them the same\nopportunity to provide a further revised draft of the merger agreement prior to the final bid submission in\norder to receive feedback and guidance from Winston.\nOn September 4, 2021, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Winston. On the same day,\nKirkland also sent Winston revised drafts of the equity commitment letter and the limited guaranty.\nOn September 5, 2021, Winston and Kirkland met by videoconference to review open issues related to TJC\u2019s\ndraft of merger agreement. At the beginning of this call, Winston focused its feedback on key issues,\nincluding the following:\nThe outside date of five months proposed in the most recent draft of the merger agreement should be\nincreased to six months\u037e\nThe continued request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder\napproval for the transaction would not be viewed favorably if it was included in the final bid\nsubmission\u037e\nThe cap proposed in the most recent draft on expense and interest in the event the reverse\ntermination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due should be eliminated or, at the\nminimum, increased\u037e\nThe company termination fee proposed in the most recent draft of 3.5% of the equity value of the\ntransaction was higher than desired by the Board\u037e and\nThe need to be provided, as soon as possible, a draft of TJC\u2019s debt commitment letter.\nThereafter, Winston also provided Kirkland with more detailed feedback on the merger agreement so that, in\nconnection with TJC preparing its final bid submission, other issues that Winston identified as remaining in\nthe markup could be eliminated or improved. Winston also indicated to Kirkland that the equity commitment\nletter and limited guaranty were nearly in executable form, but provided Kirkland with comments on open\npoints in the equity commitment letter.\nLater on the same day, Strategic A\u2019s counsel sent Winston a revised draft of the merger agreement.\nOn September 6, 2021, Winston and Strategic A\u2019s counsel met by videoconference to discuss the overlap\nanalysis and prior experiences with antitrust review in this industry (including with respect to prior deals\nentered into by Strategic A). Thereafter, Winston provided feedback to Strategic A\u2019s counsel on the revised\ndraft of the merger agreement recently provided by them. Among the issues addressed during this call was\n34 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStrategic A\u2019s refusal to agree to the \u201chell or highwater\u201d covenant requested by Echo. Although Winston\nnoted that Strategic A had improved the strength of the covenants it was providing, Winston indicated that\nif Strategic A was unwilling to provide a \u201chell or highwater\u201d covenant, it would be expected to agree to a\nreverse termination fee of 6% of the equity value of the transaction in the event the transaction failed to\nclose due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals.\nOther points of key feedback that Winston provided to Strategic A\u2019s counsel so that Strategic A could\nimprove the quality of its bid in connection with a best and final bid submission included the following:\nThe company termination fee proposed in the most recent draft of 3.5% of the enterprise value of the\ntransaction was higher than desired by the Board\u037e\nThe markup to the interim operating covenants raised concerns from a conditionality perspective\u037e and\nThe markup to the representations and warranties remained purchaser aggressive and would\nunacceptably lengthen the timeline to signing.\nOn September 6, 2021, Kirkland sent Winston a draft of the debt commitment letter contemplated by the\nproposed merger agreement with TJC. This debt commitment letter was provided by creditworthy lending\ninstitutions and was assessed to be on customary terms and conditions for a transaction of this kind.\nOn September 7, 2021, TJC submitted a \u201cfinal proposal\u201d letter in which it indicated that it had completed all\ndiligence and stood ready and willing to sign definitive agreements with respect to the transaction\nimmediately. The final proposal offered to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Echo for cash\nconsideration of $44.00 per share, which represented a 37.3% premium to the closing price on September 7,\n2021, and a 20.4% premium to the then all-time high closing price on May 5, 2021.\nAs part of its final proposal letter, TJC also submitted further revised and improved documentation,\nincluding with respect to the draft merger agreement. The improvements on key terms in the revised draft of\nthe merger agreement included:\nTJC removed its request for expense reimbursement in the event Echo failed to secure stockholder\napproval for the transaction\u037e and\nThe cap was increased to $10 million for expense and interest recoveries available in the event the\nreverse termination fee (or company termination fee) was not paid when due.\nHowever, TJC did not agree to reduce the company termination fee below 3.5% of the equity value of the\ntransaction.\nThe TJC final proposal stated that it would expire if not accepted by 9:00 p.m. on September 8, 2021.\nLater in the day on September 7, 2021, Strategic A submitted a letter with a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to acquire all of the\noutstanding capital stock of Echo for cash consideration of $44 per share. Strategic A did not, however,\nsubmit a further revised draft of the merger agreement. Instead, Strategic A\u2019s counsel sent an email to\nWinston indicating that Strategic A would not agree to a reverse termination fee in the event the transaction\nfailed to close due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals but would be reasonable on the remaining open\nissues in the draft merger agreement. Strategic A indicated that it had \u201csubstantially completed\u201d due\ndiligence, but that the proposal would expire at 5:00 p.m. on September 9, 2021, unless Strategic A was\nselected by Echo to enter into exclusive negotiations.\nEarly in the morning of September 8, 2021, the Board convened a special meeting to review the proposals\nfrom TJC and Strategic A with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. The Morgan\nStanley representatives provided the Board with a review of both bid submissions and certain financial\nanalysis. The Board then engaged in significant discussion with respect to the two bids. This discussion\nincluded a focused discussion on the execution risk presented by each proposed transaction, including the\nrisk of a failure to obtain antitrust approvals in connection with Strategic A\u2019s proposed transaction and the\nrisk of a debt financing failure in the case of TJC\u2019s proposed transaction. The Board also considered the\navailable recourse in the event of a failure to close in each of these circumstances and the likely impact to\nEcho\u2019s stockholders in the event of a failure to close each transaction. As part of this\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndiscussion the Board noted that the announcement of a transaction with Strategic A might be more\ndisruptive to Echo\u2019s business relationships and thus, that the cost of a failed transaction with Strategic A\nmay be higher than the cost of a failed transaction with TJC. The Board also believed, based on the prior\nindications of interest received from the parties that Strategic A would be able to increase its offer from the\n$44 per share valuation contemplated by its final offer and that TJC may not be able to further improve its\noffer. In addition, the Board noted that if both parties remained at the same price per share, the TJC bid\nwould be preferable because it presented higher certainty of closing and the impact of a failed transaction\nwith TJC would be less harmful to Echo and its stockholders. Accordingly, following this discussion, the\nBoard directed Morgan Stanley to reach out to Strategic A\u2019s financial advisors and advise them that Strategic\nA was not the leading bidder. The Board also directed Morgan Stanley to encourage Strategic A to consider\nincreasing the price per share in its offer, reduce the company termination fee and include a reverse\ntermination fee to compensate Echo in the event the transaction failed to close due to a failure to obtain\nantitrust approvals. Morgan Stanley was also directed to communicate that if Strategic A\u2019s offer was not\nimproved by noon, then Echo would select the other party as the winning bidder.\nAfter receiving the foregoing feedback from Morgan Stanley, Strategic A indicated that it would re-convene\nits board of directors to consider updating its proposal in order address the feedback provided by the Board.\nThat afternoon, CEO A orally conveyed to Mr. Waggoner a revised proposal with a price of $46.50 per share,\na company termination fee of 3% of the equity value of the transaction and a reverse termination fee of 5.0%\nof the equity value of the transaction, which would be payable in the event the transaction failed to close\ndue to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals.\nFollowing receipt of this improved offer, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised TJC that the competing\nproposal was superior in terms of price and break fee and asked if TJC was in a position to increase its\npurchase price to match or exceed $46.50 and to also reduce the company termination fee it had proposed\nfrom 3.5% of the equity value of the transaction to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction. In response,\nTJC indicated that it would increase its offer to $46.50 and that it would accept a company termination fee of\n3.0% of the equity value of the transaction.\nThe Board reconvened a special meeting during the afternoon of September 8, 2021, with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. In light of TJC\u2019s increased price to $46.50, which equaled the\nproposal provided by Strategic A and the Board\u2019s view that the execution risk associated with Strategic A\nwas greater because of antitrust risk, the Board determined that a transaction should be pursued with TJC.\nLater that day, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley called Strategic A\u2019s advisor\nto inform Strategic A that the Board had decided to accept the competing bid and was likely to announce a\ntransaction in the next 24 hours. Thereafter, CEO A called Mr. Waggoner and expressed his disappointment.\nLater that evening, CEO A advised Mr. Waggoner by text message that Strategic A would present a further\nrevised proposal the following morning.\nEarly in the morning of September 9, 2021, Strategic A sent a letter to Morgan Stanley with a \u201cbest and final\u201d\noffer that increased its offer from $46.50 per share to $47.00 per share and increased its proposed reverse\ntermination fee from 5% of the equity value of the transaction to 6% of the equity value of the transaction.\nThe letter stated that, following final Board approval on September 10, 2021, Strategic A would be in a\nposition to sign and announce the transaction before market open on Monday, September 13, 2021.\nAfter receiving the increased offer from Strategic A, Morgan Stanley, Winston, Mr. Waggoner and Skinner\nmet via conference call to discuss next steps in light of Strategic A\u2019s revised proposal.\nFollowing this discussion, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a discussion with CEO A to let him know\nthat the Board was asking both parties for best and final proposals by 1:00 p.m. CT. CEO A confirmed in that\nconversation that the offer of $47.00 per share indicated in its letter was Strategic A\u2019s best and final proposal.\nThe Morgan Stanley representatives also advised TJC that a revised proposal was submitted by the other\nbidder with a superior price and so the Board had requested both parties to submit their best and final\nproposal by 1:00 p.m. CT. In response, TJC increased its offer to $48.25, but indicated this increased price\nwas conditioned on the merger agreement being executed promptly after market close that same day.\n36 \n",

Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed\nwith the Board certain financial analyses. Winston provided an overview of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in\nthe context of change of control. The Morgan Stanley representatives then rendered Morgan Stanley\u2019s oral\nopinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board that, as of that date, and based upon\nand subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the\nmerger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Echo\u2019s common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Echo\u2019s common stock (other\nthan the holders of Excluded Shares (as defined below) or any of Buyer\u2019s affiliates). Following discussion,\nthe Board unanimously determined that the transaction proposed by TJC was fair to, and in the best\ninterests of, Echo and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement,\nthe merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and authorized Echo to enter\ninto the merger agreement.\nFollowing the board meeting, TJC and Echo finalized the transaction documents. In the early evening of\nSeptember 9, 2021, the parties executed the merger agreement and on the morning of September 10, 2021,\nEcho issued a press release announcing the transaction.\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\nThe Board unanimously recommends that the Echo stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting.\nThe Board, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, evaluated the merger agreement, the merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unanimously determined that the merger\nis fair to, and in the best interests of, Echo and its stockholders, unanimously approved and declared\nadvisable the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement and authorized Echo to enter into the merger agreement. Accordingly, on September 9, 2021, the\nBoard unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Echo approve the merger agreement.\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board considered the following material factors relating to\nthe merger agreement and the merger, each of which the Board believes supported its decision:\nAttractive Value. The Board believes the $48.25 per share cash price provided stockholders with\nattractive value for their shares of Echo common stock. The Board considered the current and\nhistorical prices of Echo common stock, including the market performance in light of current industry\nconditions, and the fact that $48.25 per share in cash represented a substantial premium in reference\nto a variety of stock price measurements. For instance, the $48.25 per share price constitutes a\npremium of approximately 54% to the price of Echo\u2019s common stock on September 9, 2021 (the day\nbefore the announcement of the transaction) and a premium of approximately 32% over Echo\u2019s pre-\nannouncement all time high closing share price on September 10, 2018. In addition, the $48.25 per\nshare cash consideration implied strong transaction multiples, such as 12.0x Echo\u2019s EBITDA for the\n12 months ended June 30, 2021.\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Shareholder Value. The Board concluded that entering into the\nmerger agreement was more favorable to Echo and its stockholders than the other alternatives\nreasonably available to Echo, including the continued operation of Echo on a standalone basis and\nthe pursuit of other potential actionable strategic or financial transactions. This conclusion took into\nconsideration, among other things:\nthe Board\u2019s assessment of Echo\u2019s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and\nhistorical and projected financial performance. The Board considered the nature of Echo\u2019s\nindustry and potential changes and developments in that industry, including the challenges\nfaced by industry participants and the attendant risks attributable to remaining as a public\ncompany\u037e\nthe strategic and financial alternatives reasonably available to Echo in terms of possible\nbusiness combinations with third-parties other than Buyer, taking into account the 2016 Process,\nthe 2019 Process, and the bid received by Strategic A\u037e\n37 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the risk of actively pursuing alternative transactions considerably\nexceeded the Board\u2019s assessment of the potential benefits that might be achieved and risked\njeopardizing the value to be delivered to stockholders in this transaction and the other reasons\ndiscussed in this proxy statement\u037e and\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the $48.25 per share merger consideration was the maximum amount that\nBuyer would offer to pay to acquire Echo.\nOpportunity to Receive Alternative Proposals and to Terminate the merger agreement to Accept a\nSuperior Proposal. The Board considered the terms of the merger agreement relating to Echo\u2019s ability\nto respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals and the other terms of the merger agreement,\nincluding:\nEcho\u2019s right, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in response to, and to discuss\nand negotiate, certain unsolicited acquisition proposals made before stockholder approval of the\nmerger is obtained\u037e\nThe Board\u2019s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third-parties\nfrom making a superior proposal\u037e\nThe Board\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that\nEcho\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e\nthe Board\u2019s ability to terminate the merger agreement prior to obtaining stockholder approval of\nthe merger, in specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a\ntermination fee which the Board believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, consistent\nwith or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.\nCertainty of Value. The Board considered that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, thereby\nproviding Echo\u2019s stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Echo common\nstock, especially when viewed against the risks and uncertainties inherent in Echo\u2019s business,\nincluding risks associated with executing upon Echo\u2019s current and long-term strategies in light of the\ncompetitive marketplace.\nLikelihood of Completion. The Board considered the likelihood of completion of the merger to be a\nsignificant factor in support of the transaction, in light of, among other things:\nEcho\u2019s ability to, under certain circumstances, specifically enforce the agreement to prevent\nbreaches of the merger agreement and to enforce the terms of the merger agreement, including\nthe consummation of the merger\u037e\nthe consummation of the merger not being subject to a financing condition\u037e\nthe reverse termination fee of $79,176,000.00 that would become payable to Echo under certain\ncircumstances (as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nCompany Termination Fee\u037e Buyer Termination Fee\u201d)\u037e\nthe expectation that the outside date of March 9, 2022 is likely to allow for sufficient time to\ncomplete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e\nthe conditions to closing in the merger agreement, which the Board believes are reasonable and\ncustomary in number and scope, and which, in the case of the conditions related to the absence\nof material adverse changes between the announcement and closing of the transaction and the\naccuracy of Echo\u2019s representations and warranties, are generally qualified by a traditional public\ncompany \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d standard.\nBusiness Reputation of TJC. The business reputation and financial reputation of TJC. The Board\nbelieved that these factors supported the conclusion that a transaction with Buyer (which is owned\nby TJC) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a substantial likelihood of\nbeing consummated successfully.\nReceipt of Fairness Opinion from Morgan Stanley. The Board considered the oral opinion of Morgan\nStanley (subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of such date and based\n38 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nupon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its\nwritten opinion, the merger consideration of $48.25 per share in cash to be received by the holders of\nEcho common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the\nholders of Echo common stock (other than the holders of Excluded Shares or any of Buyer\u2019s\naffiliates). See, \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u202f-\u202fOpinion of Morgan Stanley.\u201d\nLong-term Interests of Echo. The Board considered that, in addition to providing an attractive\noutcome for the holders of Echo common stock and the best alternative reasonably available for\nmaximizing stockholder value, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement also promote\nand advance the long-term interests of Echo and its other stakeholders, including employees,\ncustomers, and suppliers.\nAppraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders\nwho timely and properly exercise such appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board also considered the risks and potentially negative\nfactors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including:\nthat Echo stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Echo following the merger, and\nthat such stockholders will therefore cease to participate in the future earnings or growth that Echo\nmay achieve, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of Echo\u2019s common stock as a result of\nthe merger\u037e\nas the transaction has a potential outside date of March 9, 2022, that Echo stockholders could be\nasked to vote on and approve the merger agreement well in advance of the completion of the\ntransaction, depending on when the transaction actually closes\u037e\nthe announcement and pendency of the merger, or that the failure to complete the merger, may cause\nsubstantial harm to Echo\u2019s business, sales operations, financial results, and Echo\u2019s relationships with\nits current or prospective employees\u037e\nthe risk of management distraction as a result of the merger\u037e\nthe restrictions in the merger agreement on Echo\u2019s ability to solicit competing proposals (subject to\ncertain exceptions to allow the Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior\nproposal, and then only upon the payment of a termination fee)\u037e\nthe merger agreement\u2019s restrictions on the conduct of Echo\u2019s business before completion of the\nmerger, generally requiring Echo to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting Echo\nfrom taking specified actions, which may delay or prevent Echo from undertaking unanticipated\nbusiness opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger (as more fully described in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fConduct of Business Pending the merger\u201d)\u037e\nthe possibility that Echo may be required under the terms of the merger agreement to pay a\ntermination fee of\u202f$39,588,000 under certain circumstances (as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fCompany Termination Fee\u037e Buyer Termination Fee\u201d)\u037e\nthe reverse termination fee of $79,176,000.00 that would become payable to Echo under certain\ncircumstances (as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fCompany\nTermination Fee\u037e Buyer Termination Fee\u201d) is not payable by Buyer to Echo in all instances in which\nthe merger agreement may be terminated and such reverse termination fee may not be sufficient to\ncompensate Echo for the damage suffered by Echo during this period\u037e\nthat the receipt of cash by Echo stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock pursuant\nto the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to Echo stockholders for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes (as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of merger\u201d)\u037e and\nthe interests that Echo\u2019s directors and executive officers may have in the merger, which may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\n39 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board includes the material factors\nconsidered by the Board but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the Board. In view of the\ncomplexity and variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger,\nthe Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors\nconsidered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given\ndifferent weights to different factors. The Board unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Echo\napprove the merger and the merger agreement based upon the totality of information it considered.\nCertain Echo Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nIn connection with the merger, the Company\u2019s management prepared a set of non-public, unaudited financial\nforecasts with respect to the Company\u2019s business for fiscal years 2021 through 2025 (the \u201cCompany\nProjections\u201d). The Company Projections were provided to the Company\u2019s Board and the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisor in connection with their respective consideration and evaluation of the merger.\nThe Company does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance for extended\nperiods beyond one fiscal year due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting\nfinancial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates.\nHowever, the Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited\nprospective financial information for the Company, without giving effect to the merger, solely to give\nCompany stockholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Company\u2019s Board, the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisor and Buyer for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion\nof the Company Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the\nCompany, Buyer or any of their respective boards of directors or representatives or any other recipient of\nthis information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or\nan accurate prediction of future results, and the Company Projections should not be relied on as such.\nThe Company Projections, and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were\nbased, are subjective in many respects, and subject to different interpretations and potential revisions\nattributable to the nature of the transportation and supply chain management business, as well as actual\nexperience and business developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Company Projections\nare forward-looking and reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company performance, industry\nperformance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters,\nmany of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and\nbeyond the Company\u2019s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d could cause the Company Projections\nor the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company\nProjections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected.\nBecause the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable\nwith each successive year.\nThe Company Projections were prepared in good faith by Company management based on their reasonable\nbest estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected future financial performance of the Company at\nthe time the Company Projections were prepared and speak only as of that time. Economic and business\nenvironments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to\nwhether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be achieved. The inclusion of the Company\nProjections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company or\nany other person that the information is material.\nThe summary of the Company Projections is provided in this proxy statement solely for informational\npurposes only and is not provided to influence Company stockholders\u2019 decisions regarding whether to vote\nfor the merger proposal or any other proposal.\nThe Company Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines\nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of\nprospective financial information.

The Ernst &\nYoung report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to the Company\u2019s historical financial\ninformation. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be\nread to do so.\nThe following is a summary of the Company Projections:\nSummary of the Company Projections\n \n(dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$ 516\n$ 489\n$ 520\n$ 554\n$ 592\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 124\n$ 113\n$ 123\n$ 140\n$ 158\nAdjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures\n$ 96\n$ 83\n$ 91\n$ 105\n$ 121\nEarnings Per Share\n$2.73\n$2.37\n$2.54\n$2.89\n$3.25\nThe Company Projections represents management projections as of July 27, 2021\nAdjusted Gross Profit is defined for purposes of the Company Projections as revenue less\ntransportation costs (excludes internal use software depreciation). This Non-GAAP measure is different\nfrom measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar\nmeasures used by other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income\nor net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined for purposes of the Company Projections as net income before interest\nexpense, investment and other income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, excluding stock\ncompensation expense. This Non-GAAP measure is different from measures determined in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should\nnot be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating\nperformance or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.\nThis Non-GAAP measure is different from measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may\nnot be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered as an\nalternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow or as\na measure of liquidity.\nEarnings Per Share calculated using weighted average shares outstanding as of July 27, 2021.\nThe Company Projections include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The\nCompany believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for\nstockholders to use in evaluating the Company\u2019s potential future operating results and trends. These non-\nGAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided, they are presented on a non-GAAP basis without reconciliations of such forward-looking non-\nGAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and\nquantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation\nThe Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company\nof the merger and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined company. The\nCompany Projections do not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the\nmerger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the effect\non the Company of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of\nthe merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions\nthat would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead\naltered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Company Projections\ndo not take into account the effect on the Company of any possible failure of the merger to occur.\n41 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n",

Consequently, the\nanalyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Company\u2019s Board\nwith respect to the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Company\u2019s\nBoard would have been willing to agree to different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved\nby a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its\ncustomary practice.\nThe Company\u2019s Board retained Morgan Stanley based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and\nexpertise and its familiarity with the Company.

In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working\nwith the Company in connection with this transaction, may have committed and may commit in the future to\ninvest in private equity funds managed by Buyer or its affiliates.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter dated July 13, 2021, Morgan Stanley provided the Company\nfinancial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B, in connection with the merger. As compensation for Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial advisory services,\nthe Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the\nclosing of the merger, of approximately $24 million (the \u201cMorgan Stanley Transaction Fee\u201d). As\ncompensation for Morgan Stanley rendering a financial opinion to the Company\u2019s Board, the Company paid\nMorgan Stanley a fee equal to $1.5 million, which will be credited against the Morgan Stanley Transaction\nFee payable if the merger is consummated. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for\nits expenses incurred from time to time in connection with this engagement. In addition, the Company has\nagreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees\nand agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates, against certain\nlosses, claims, damages or liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, and to\nreimburse certain expenses relating to such indemnity.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing\nservices to Buyer and certain of its affiliates and expects to receive fees in connection with such services. In\nthe two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not received any fees\nfrom the Company in connection with financial advisory or financing services. Morgan Stanley may also\nseek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Buyer and the Company and their respective\naffiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nFinancing\nThe merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Buyer. It is anticipated that the total amount of\nfunds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions, and to pay the fees and expenses\nrequired to be paid at the closing of the merger by Buyer and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, will be\napproximately $1,418.5 million in cash. In connection with the financing of the merger, The Resolute Fund V,\nL.P. (the \u201cTJC Fund\u201d) and Buyer have entered into an equity commitment letter, dated September 9, 2021 (the\n\u201cEquity Commitment Letter\u201d), in respect of the Equity Commitment.

The Company\u2019s Board of Directors was aware of these\ninterests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation that Company\nstockholders vote to approve the merger agreement. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) -\nBackground of the Merger\u201d and the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1) - Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the Echo Board of Directors.\u201d These interests are described in more detail below, and\ncertain of them are quantified in the narrative and the table below.\nThese material interests are summarized below:\n49 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe merger agreement provides for accelerated vesting and the cash-out of all Company restricted\nstock awards, performance shares and restricted stock units.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s executive officers may receive change in control severance compensation\nand benefits under existing agreements between such officers and the Company.\nThe merger agreement provides for the payment of minimum annual bonuses to the Company\u2019s\nexecutive officers for calendar year 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and\ninsurance coverage under indemnification agreements and the merger agreement.\nArrangements with Parent\nAny Company executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who\notherwise are retained to provide services to Parent or the surviving corporation following the closing of the\nmerger, however, may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in cash\nor equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent or the surviving corporation. As of the date\nof this proxy statement/prospectus, no compensation arrangements between such persons and Parent and/or\nits affiliates have been established. Pursuant to the merger agreement, our executive officers will serve as\nofficers of the surviving corporation immediately following the effective time until their successors have\nbeen duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance\nwith the surviving corporation\u2019s charter and by-laws.\nTreatment and Quantification of Outstanding Company Equity Awards\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Company equity awards held by directors and executive officers\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment:\nRestricted Stock. At the effective time, each outstanding share of restricted stock will be canceled and\nconverted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the per share merger\nconsideration less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, as provided in\nthe merger agreement.\nPerformance Shares. At the effective time, each outstanding performance share, to the extent unvested, shall\nvest either (1) as if the target level of performance had been achieved as of the effective time or (2) if\nspecifically provided under an individual employment agreement or award agreement in the event of a\n\u201cchange of control,\u201d at the greater of target or actual performance through the closing.

If the participant were to incur\na termination without cause or a termination for good reason (as referenced in the merger agreement and as\ndefined in their employment agreements) on or after the merger effective time, but prior to December 31, 2021,\nthe named executive officer also would be eligible to receive a bonus for 2021 in an amount equal to the\ngreater of the Actual 2021 Performance Bonus and the Executive Minimum Bonus Amount. The bonus\namount is payable, in each case, as soon as practicable following the completion of the Company\u2019s 2021\naudit and no later than March 15, 2022.\nContractual Change in Control Benefits\nPursuant to the terms of their employment agreements, upon the closing of the merger our named executive\nofficers are eligible for single-trigger accelerated vesting of 50% of their outstanding time-vested equity\nawards (i.e., restricted stock and restricted stock units) and 50% of their outstanding performance-vested\nawards (i.e., performance shares) at the greater of target or actual performance through the effective time of\nthe merger. Our named executive officers\u2019 equity award agreements provide for single-trigger accelerated\nvesting of 100% of their outstanding performance shares upon the closing of the merger, with 50% vesting at\ntarget through the end of the performance period and 50% vesting based on the better of target or actual\nperformance through the date of closing. Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon the closing of the merger,\nour named executive officers are eligible for single-trigger accelerated vesting of 100% of the executive\nofficers\u2019 outstanding time-vested awards and 100% of their outstanding performance shares as if the target\nlevel of performance had been achieved through the date of closing. The merger agreement also provides\nthat with respect to our named executive officers\u2019 outstanding performance shares, if their individual\nemployment agreements or award agreements provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding\nperformance shares shall vest at the greater of target or actual performance through the date of closing, such\nprovision shall control with respect to the vesting of such performance shares (as is the case here under the\nequity award agreements with respect to 50% of the named executive officers\u2019 outstanding performance\nshares). The named executive officers are thus eligible for acceleration of their outstanding time-vested\nequity awards, acceleration of their outstanding performance vested awards, and a guaranteed amount of\ntheir 2021 AIP payments under the merger agreement. Other than the single-trigger payments as indicated\nabove, our executive officers are not eligible for any other single-trigger payments upon the closing of the\nmerger.\n51 \n(1)\n(2)\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOur executive officers are eligible for certain double-trigger payments.

Waggoner and Menzel are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during their\nemployment term and for a period of 24 months following a termination of employment for any or no reason\nand Mr. Rogers is subject to similar restrictions during his employment term and for a period of 12 months\nfollowing a termination of employment for any or no reason. Further, each named executive officer entered\ninto a confidentiality agreement upon joining the Company that would remain in place following a double-\ntrigger termination.\nThe employment agreements provide that any payments and benefits payable to the named executive officer\nwill be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid any excise taxes on \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d that would\notherwise be imposed under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code (\u201c280G Cutback\u201d), solely to the\nextent such reduction would put the named executive officer in a better position on an after-tax basis than if\nhe received the excess parachute payments subject to the excise tax (\u201cBest Pay Cutback Provision\u201d).

If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the Antitrust\nDivision or FTC issues a request for additional information or documentary material (a \u201csecond request\u201d)\nfrom Buyer and Echo, the waiting period with respect to the merger would be extended until the 30th calendar\nday following the date of the parties\u2019 substantial compliance with the second request. After that time, absent\nthe agreement of Buyer and Echo, the acquisition can be blocked only by court order. The Antitrust Division\nand the FTC may terminate the applicable waiting period at any time before its expiration.\nAt any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust\nDivision or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of\nthe merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally permit completion of the merger subject to regulatory\nconditions or other remedies.\nIn addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to\nenjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties\nmay also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither\nBuyer nor Echo believes that the merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a\nchallenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would\nnot be successful.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nOn October 12, 2021, a purported shareholder of Echo filed a complaint in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York, captioned Stein v. Echo Global Logistics, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08399\n(S.D.N.Y.). The complaint names the Company and the Company\u2019s directors as defendants. The complaint\nasserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the disclosures\ncontained in the October 5, 2021 preliminary proxy statement issued by the Company.\nAlso on October 12, 2021, another purported shareholder filed a complaint in the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York, captioned Jones v. Echo Global Logistics, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-\n08410 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint names the Company and the Company\u2019s directors as defendants. The\ncomplaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the\ndisclosures contained in the October 5, 2021 preliminary proxy statement issued by the Company.\nThe complaints seek a variety of equitable and injunctive relief including, among other things, enjoining the\nconsummation of the merger, rescinding the transaction if it is consummated, and awarding the plaintiffs\ncosts and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe Company believes the claims in each complaint are without merit. However, at this time it is not possible\nto predict the outcome of these matters or their effects on the Company or the merger. An adverse judgment\nfor monetary damages could have an adverse effect on the Company. A preliminary injunction could delay or\njeopardize the completion of the merger, and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could\nindefinitely enjoin completion of the merger.\nEcho stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the transaction, which may name Echo, members\nof Echo\u2019s Board, or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or\nthe lawsuits described above.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock\nIf the merger is completed, Echo common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the\nExchange Act.\n58 ",
