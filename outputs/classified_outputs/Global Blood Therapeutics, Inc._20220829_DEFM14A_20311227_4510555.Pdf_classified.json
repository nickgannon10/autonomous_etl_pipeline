You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the\nSpecial Meeting website.\nIf you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nShareholders may call toll-free: 1 (877) 825-8793\nBanks and Brokers may call collect: 1 (212) 750-5833\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of GBT common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than\none account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a GBT stockholder of record and other shares\nthrough a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive\nmultiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares\nyou own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by\nmail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address\nwith another GBT stockholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for\nproxy statements with respect to two or more GBT stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single\nproxy statement to those GBT stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d,\npotentially provides extra convenience for GBT stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nGBT and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to\nmultiple GBT stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected GBT stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding\nand would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of\nthese documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your\nbroker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or GBT if you are a GBT stockholder of record by making a\nrequest to our Secretary at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or by calling (650) 741-\n7700. In addition, GBT will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number\nabove, a separate copy of the proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In\naddition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, GBT will file the final voting\nresults of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results)\nwith the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nGBT has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting.\nGBT expects to pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $37,500, plus certain costs associated with additional\nservices, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket fees and\nexpenses. GBT has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against various liabilities and expenses\nthat relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nGBT also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective\nagents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of GBT common stock. GBT\ndirectors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They\nwill not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of\ncompletion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified\nin the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control. For\nmore information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to\nthe Closing of the Merger\u201d.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about GBT?\nA:\nGBT will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual\nReport to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nwithout charge to any GBT stockholder who makes a request in writing or by telephone to GBT\u2019s Investor\nRelations Department at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or (650) 741-7700.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Company\u2019s management and the Board regularly review the Company\u2019s performance and prospects in light of its\nbusiness and developments in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. These reviews have included\nconsideration, from time to time, of potential partnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions to enhance\nstockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such reviews have been accompanied by periodic\nconversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in such\nindustries regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.\nOn May 26, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Dr. Ted W. Love, the Company\u2019s President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, to schedule time to speak. The representative of Company A and Dr. Love spoke on June 2, 2022\nand proposed a meeting between Dr. Love and representatives of Company A. On June 6, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms.\nJung E. Choi, the Company\u2019s Chief Business and Strategy Officer, met with representatives of Company A. During\nthis meeting, the representatives of Company A provided a letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire 100%\nof the Company\u2019s equity for $55.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 6\nCompany A Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 111% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common\nstock of $26.11 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 6 Company A Proposal. The offer letter stated\nthat its submission had the support of Company A\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn June 7, 2022, management of the Company apprised the Board of the June 6 Company A Proposal and a Board\nmeeting was scheduled for June 8, 2022 to discuss the June 6 Company A Proposal.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, a financial\nadvisor to the Company, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (which we refer to as \u201cCravath\u201d) and Goodwin Procter\nLLP (which we refer to as \u201cGoodwin\u201d), outside counsel to the Company, met virtually to discuss, among other topics,\nthe June 6 Company A Proposal. Dr. Love described to the Board his interactions with representatives of Company A\nprior to and following the receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal. Members of management briefed the Board on\nthe Company\u2019s ongoing assessment of its long-range plans, which would be further discussed at the September 2022\nstrategic retreat, and the Company\u2019s next steps in light of its receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan provided a market overview and their preliminary view of the June 6 Company A\nProposal, and representatives of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties and other\nlegal matters. The Board determined to continue to consider the June 6 Company A Proposal, following a preliminary\nfinancial analysis to be performed prior to the next Board meeting.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company selected Centerview as an additional financial advisor to the Company (we refer to J.P.\nMorgan and Centerview, collectively, as \u201cthe Company\u2019s financial advisors\u201d).\nOn June 14, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, met\nvirtually for a regularly scheduled meeting during which, among other topics, the June 6 Company A Proposal was\ndiscussed. At the meeting, a representative of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties\nand other legal matters. The Board and representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors discussed, along with\nmembers of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, among other topics, the June 6 Company A\nProposal and certain strategic considerations in connection with a potential sale transaction, as well as an overview\nof other potential acquirors of the Company. Representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors presented their\npreliminary financial review of the June 6 Company A Proposal based on preliminary financial projections provided\nby management. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company\u2019s management, with the assistance of its\nfinancial and legal advisors, to inform Company A that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient from a\nfinancial perspective. However, the Board authorized the Company\u2019s management, with the assistance of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors, to provide Company A with limited high-level information, upon execution of the\nconfidentiality agreement, in order to enable Company A to improve its offer price. The Board also authorized the\nCompany\u2019s management, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, to solicit interest from additional\npotential acquirors to gauge their interest in a potential transaction with the Company and, if a potential acquiror of\nthe Company indicated an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, to send such potential acquiror a\ndraft confidentiality agreement and,\n27TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nonce entered into, commence discussions with such potential acquiror. In order to facilitate the Board providing\nguidance to the Company\u2019s management during the negotiations of the potential sale transaction, the Board adopted\nresolutions forming a transaction committee (which we refer to as the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d), consisting of Scott\nMorrison, Mark Perry and Dawn Svoronos. The Board decided that, while the Transaction Committee would be\ncomprised of three members of the Board, all Board members would be invited to, and strongly encouraged to\nparticipate in, any and all meetings of the Transaction Committee. Over the next several weeks, in addition to formal\nBoard meetings, Dr. Love and other members of the Company\u2019s senior management periodically briefed and received\ninput from several Board members as to the discussions with representatives of certain of the potential acquirors.\nOn June 15, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms. Choi met virtually with representatives of Company A. Dr. Love informed the\nrepresentatives of Company A that the Board had determined that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient\nfrom a financial perspective, but that, following the execution by Company A of a confidentiality agreement, Dr. Love\nand a limited number of other senior management of the Company would make themselves available for a\nconversation to help Company A learn about the Company in order to facilitate an increase in Company A\u2019s offer\nprice. The representatives of Company A informed the Company that Company A would send a diligence request list\nthat would help Company A better understand the value of the Company.\nLater on June 15, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a\nconfidentiality agreement to Company A, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of\nthe Company, Company A, Cravath and Company A\u2019s outside counsel. The confidentiality agreement between the\nCompany and Company A was executed on June 18, 2022.\nOn June 16, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors spoke\ntelephonically with representatives of Pfizer to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Pfizer contacted representatives of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this conversation, at the\ndirection of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a confidentiality agreement to\nPfizer, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of the Company, Pfizer and Cravath.\nThe confidentiality agreement between the Company and Pfizer was executed on June 27, 2022.\nOn June 17, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors spoke\ntelephonically with representatives of Company B to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Company B contacted representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this\nconversation, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors provided a\nconfidentiality agreement to representatives of Company B, which was negotiated over the next several days among\nrepresentatives of the Company, Company B and Cravath.

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board has unanimously: (a) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, GBT and its stockholders\u037e (b) approved\nthe Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including the execution,\ndelivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger\u037e (c) resolved to recommend that GBT stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n(d) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by GBT stockholders at the\nSpecial Meeting.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to\nsolicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special\nMeeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nAs described above in the section entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d, prior to and in reaching its unanimous\ndetermination to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger advisable and in the best interests of the Company and stockholders\nof the Company and recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger, the Board consulted with and\nreceived the advice of its financial advisors and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and considered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby, including, among other things, the following non-exhaustive list of\nmaterial factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nMerger Consideration\u037e Premium to the Trading Price of GBT Common Stock. The Board considered the\ncurrent and historical market prices of GBT common stock, including the market performance of GBT\ncommon stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry and general market indices,\nand the fact that the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock represented a:\n\u2022\n102% premium to the unaffected trading price at which GBT common stock closed on August 3, 2022,\nthe last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the\nCompany\u037e\n\u2022\n110% premium to the volume weighted average price for GBT common stock over the 30-trading day\nperiod ended August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation\nregarding a potential sale of the Company\u037e and\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\n70% premium to the highest closing price in the 52-week period ended August 3, 2022, the last trading\nday that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is\nall cash, which will provide GBT stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of\nGBT common stock, enables GBT stockholders to realize value that has been created by GBT and does not\nexpose them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions (including the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), as compared to GBT remaining independent (especially when viewed against the\npotential risks and uncertainties inherent in GBT\u2019s business, including risks related to obtaining marketing\napprovals for products and the timing of regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing,\nlabeling, pricing and market acceptance of product candidates).\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Board considered the fact that Pfizer and Merger Sub would have sufficient\ncash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement and that the Merger is\nnot subject to a financing condition.\n\u2022\nSale Process. The Board considered the fact that it had engaged in extensive discussions regarding\nstrategic options and potential acquirors with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors. In particular, the process conducted by the Board, with the assistance of the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors, involved contacting, or responding to, six potential acquirors, entering into\nnon-disclosure agreements with and providing management presentations and granting due diligence\naccess to three potential acquirors, receiving non-binding offers from three potential acquirors and\nreceiving two final proposals, one of which was from Pfizer. The Board also considered the fact that the\nmedia coverage regarding GBT\u2019s discussions with potentially interested parties did not result in any\noutreach or proposals from any new potential acquirors. For a detailed discussion of the sale process,\nplease see above under the heading entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Board considered the\nCompany\u2019s operating and financial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts\nfor the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s senior management, which reflect an application of various\nassumptions of senior management. The Board considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving senior\nmanagement\u2019s prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading entitled \u201c-Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d, and that as a result the Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ\nmaterially from senior management\u2019s forecasts.\n\u2022\nBest Strategic Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a thorough review of strategic\nalternatives and discussions with management and the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors, the Board\ndetermined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the\npotential value that might result from other strategic options available, including, but not limited to,\nremaining a standalone public company. The Board also carefully evaluated, with the assistance of legal\nand financial advisors and members of management, the risks and potential benefits associated with other\nstrategic or financial alternatives and the potential for shareholder value creation associated with those\nalternatives. As part of these evaluations, the Board considered:\n\u2022\nan assessment of the Company\u2019s business, assets (including commercial-stage and pipeline assets),\nprospects, competitive position, regulatory landscape, historical and projected financial performance,\nshort- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in which the Company competes\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with the Company\u2019s business and remaining a standalone public company,\nincluding (i) the results of the Company\u2019s commercialization of Oxbryta, (ii) obtaining marketing\napprovals for Oxbryta in additional indications or in additional jurisdictions and (iii) the timing of\nregulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing, labeling, pricing and market acceptance of\nthe Company\u2019s product candidates.\n\u2022\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s and Centerview\u2019s Respective Fairness Opinions and Related Financial Analyses. The\nBoard considered (i) the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022, which was\nsubsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndate and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with its opinion, the\nMerger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT stockholders (other\nthan as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders and (ii) the oral opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022,\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its\nopinion, the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT\nstockholders (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in such opinion)) pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        "Section Text": "Opinion of J.P. Morgan\nPursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as one of its financial advisors in connection\nwith the proposed Merger.\nAt the meeting of the Board on August 7, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such\ndate and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P.\nMorgan has confirmed its August 7, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated August 7,\n2022, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated August 7, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the\nassumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. GBT stockholders are urged to read\nthe opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in\nconnection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger\nConsideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other\n40TABLE OF CONTENTS\nclass of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a fairness\ncommittee of J.P. Morgan. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any\nGBT stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the\nindustries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain\ntransactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such\ncompanies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information\nconcerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices of the GBT common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management\nof the Company relating to its business, which are referred to in this summary of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as\nthe \u201cManagement Forecasts\u201d, and are described further in the section of this proxy statement below\nentitled \u201c-Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition\nand future prospects and operations of the Company and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or\nappropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for\nJ.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness (and\ndid not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification). J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was\nnot provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of\nthe Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying\non financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they\nwere reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by\nmanagement as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such\nanalyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on\nwhich they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the\nrepresentations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,\nregulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues.\nJ.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for\nthe consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated\nbenefits of the Merger.\nThe Management Projections were prepared by the Company\u2019s management. The Company does not publicly\ndisclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nanalysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and\nmay be beyond the control of the Company\u2019s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general\neconomic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary\nsignificantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other\nforward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement below entitled \u201c-Certain Financial\nForecasts\u201d.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that\nsubsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to\nupdate, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed\nno opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P.\nMorgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or\nemployees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration in\nthe proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm\u2019s length\nnegotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that\nof the Board. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the\nBoard in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board\nor management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation\nmethodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on August 7, 2022 and contained in the presentation delivered to\nthe Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to be\na complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to\nmore fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text\nof each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nPublic Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the\nCompany with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged\nto be analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:\nSelected Companies\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCrispr Therapeutics AG\nIntellia Therapeutics, Inc.\nAmicus Therapeutics, Inc.\nINSMED Inc.\nBiocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nChemoCentryx, Inc.\nEditas Medicine, Inc.\nReata Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMedian FV/2026E Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations\nand business that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, J.P. Morgan considered to be similar to those of the\nCompany. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe selected companies differently than they would affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the multiple of the firm value (\u201cFV\u201d) for the Company and\nthe selected companies (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable net debt or net cash) to the analyst\nconsensus estimates for calendar year 2026 revenues for the applicable company (the \u201cFV/2026E Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2026E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of\n1.1x to 5.2x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the calendar year\n2026 provided in the Management Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the\nGBT common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $21.25 to $88.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to\nthe implied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nSelected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with\nrespect to businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be similar to the Company\u2019s business (or aspects thereof) based\non J.P. Morgan\u2019s experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates. The following\ntransactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:\nAnnouncement Date\nTarget\nAcquiror\nJanuary 19, 2022\nZogenix, Inc.\nUCB S.A.\nSeptember 8. 2021\nKadmon Holdings, Inc.\nSanofi\nFebruary 1, 2021\nViela Bio, Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nAugust 31, 2020\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc.\nNestl\u00e9 S.A.\nMay 5, 2020\nPortola Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2019\nDova Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nSwedish Orphan Biovitrum AB\nSeptember 12, 2016\nRaptor Pharmaceutical Corp.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nJuly 21, 2016\nRelypsa Inc.\nGalenica Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nMarch 30, 2015\nHyperion Therapeutics Inc.\nHorizon Therapeutics plc\nMedian FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple = 3.5x\nNone of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions\nwere chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered\nsimilar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning\ndifferences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect\nthe transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company\u2019s estimated forward revenue for the fourth\nyear following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the \u201cFV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple\u201d).\nBased on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple reference range for the\nCompany of 2.6x to 5.4x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company\u2019s projected revenue for the\ntwelve-month period ending September 30, 2026, $1.2 billion, which amount was provided by the management of the\nCompany. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT common stock (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.25) of approximately $44.25 to $83.75, which J.P. Morgan compared to the implied per share equity value\nof the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of\ndetermining the fully diluted equity value per share for the GBT common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered\nfree cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2042, including\nthe impact of certain net operating losses based upon the Management Forecasts. J.P. Morgan also calculated a\nrange of terminal values of the Company at the end of this period by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from\n(50.0%) to (30.0%) for Oxbryta, GBT601 and inclacumab, 5.0% for research assets and 2.0%\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfor corporate overhead and other unallocated expenses based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management,\nto estimates of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during calendar year 2042 as set forth in the\nManagement Forecasts. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to\npresent values as of September 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen by\nJ.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the\nunlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by adding net cash as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, $351 million, which estimate was provided by the management of the Company. This analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values for the Company, which J.P. Morgan divided by the number of outstanding\nshares of GBT common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis and adjusted for the Company\u2019s assumed future\nequity raise of $200 million in gross proceeds in 2023, to derive a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT\ncommon stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $52.25 and $65.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to the\nimplied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.\nCertain Other Information. J.P. Morgan also reviewed the Company\u2019s 52 week historical trading and analyst price\ntargets, in each case as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of GBT\ncommon stock was perceived by J.P. Morgan to be affected by a potential transaction) which ranged from $22.30 to\n$40.26 and $31.00 to $102.00, respectively. J.P. Morgan noted that historical stock trading and analyst price targets\nanalyses are not valuation methodologies but were presented merely for informational purposes.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the\nforegoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of\nthe processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the\nCompany. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses\nor factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or\nnegative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the\ntotality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.\nMorgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected\ntransactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are\npublicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be\nconsidered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their\nparticipants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.\nThe analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and\noperational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to\nthe Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control\npurposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the\nMerger and deliver an opinion to the Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such\nexperience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company\nand the industries in which it operates.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger (including the delivery of its opinion), the\nCompany will pay J.P. Morgan an aggregate fee of, approximately, $53,200,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable\nupon public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement with respect to a Merger and the remainder of\nwhich is payable upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P.\nMorgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,\nand will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two\nyears preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material\nfinancial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company. During the\ntwo years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with Parent, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary\ncompensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on\nParent\u2019s credit facility in November 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on Parent\u2019s offering of debt securities in August\n2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit\nfacilities of Parent, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two-year\nperiod preceding delivery of its opinion on August 7, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Parent\nwere approximately $14 million. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of\nthe outstanding common stock of each of the Company and Parent. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P.\nMorgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including\nderivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of\ncustomers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial\ninstruments.",

        "Section Text": "Capped Call Transactions\nOn December 14, 2021, in connection with the pricing of GBT\u2019s 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (which we\nrefer to as the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), GBT entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (which we refer\nto as the \u201cBase Capped Call Transactions\u201d) with each of Jefferies International Limited, Mizuho Securities USA, LLC,\nas agent for Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as agent for Royal Bank of Canada, and\nWells Fargo Bank National Association (which we refer to as the \u201cCapped Call Counterparties\u201d). On December 15,\n2021, in connection with the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, GBT\nentered into additional capped call transactions with each of the Capped Call Counterparties (which we refer to as the\n\u201cAdditional Capped Call Transactions\u201d and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions, the \u201cCapped Call\nTransactions\u201d).\nThe Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares\nof GBT common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is\n$31.7475 per share of GBT common stock, and the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is $49.80 per share of\nGBT common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The\nCapped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to GBT common stock upon conversion\nof the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that GBT could be required to make in excess of\nthe principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject\nto a cap based on the cap price.\nIf the Merger is consummated, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes, and the\nconsummation of the Merger is expected to result in the full termination of the Capped Call Transactions. The value\nreceived by the Company in connection with the termination or unwinding of the Capped Call Transactions would be\ndetermined by the Capped Call Counterparties based on the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions, which is\ncontingent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, volatility, spot price and liquidity of GBT common\nstock.\nIn addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the\napplicable Capped Call Transactions on more than one occasion to reflect the economic effect of such\nannouncement, including if such economic effect is material, and regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\nEach Capped Call Counterparty shall, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its capacity as\ncalculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, determine whether such announcement has had a\nmaterial economic effect on such Capped Call Transaction and may take into account a number of factors, including\nthe date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call Transaction at that time), the stock price of\nGBT common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of GBT common stock,\nin determining whether an adjustment to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call\nCounterparty may make additional adjustments to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction following the\nannouncement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the abandonment or discontinuation of, the\nMerger.\nThe indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped\nCall Transactions were included as exhibits, in each case, to GBT\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by GBT with the\nSEC on December 17, 2021. All references in this section of this proxy statement to share counts, conversion prices\nand strike prices may change from time to time in accordance with the terms of the relevant confirmations.",

The members of the Board were aware of and considered these\ninterests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that GBT stockholders\nvote their GBT common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards\nAt the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, equity awards granted on or prior to the date of the\nMerger Agreement that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for the right\nto receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such\nCompany Option immediately prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of\nthe Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash\nequal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to\nthe completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration\u037e\n\u2022\neach outstanding Company PSU, other than Stock Price PSUs, will be canceled and converted into the right\nto receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such\nCompany PSU immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (assuming that all applicable performance\nmeasures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of\nperformance (measured as of the Effective Time)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration\u037e and\n\u2022\neach outstanding Stock Price PSU will be forfeited.\nAt the Effective Time, equity awards that may be granted to employees of the Company (including the executive\nofficers) after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and that remain outstanding as of\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into cash awards (based on the Merger Consideration\nmultiplied by the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to the applicable award immediately prior to the\ncompletion of the Merger) subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding award. Upon an\nexecutive officer\u2019s qualifying termination within one year following the completion of the Merger, subject to the\nexecution of a release of claims in favor of Pfizer and the Company, any such awards would be subject to pro rata\naccelerated vesting based on the number of days elapsed from the grant date to the termination date relative to the\ntotal number of days in the vesting period.\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table sets forth the number of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of\nthe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers as of August 15, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such\namounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and the cash amounts payable (on a pre-tax basis) in respect\nthereof. The amounts reflected in the table below exclude any grants that may be made following August 15, 2022 and\nany Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance\nwith their terms prior to December 31, 2022 (the assumed date of the completion of the Merger solely for purposes of\nthis transaction-related compensation disclosure). Company Options are valued based on the difference between the\nper share exercise price of such Company Option and the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share. As a result, any\nCompany Option included in the table below that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger\nConsideration does not have any value for purposes of the table below. Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other\nthan Stock Price PSUs) are valued based on the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share.

The number of\nCompany PSUs shown assumes that Company PSUs subject to total shareholder return performance metrics have been earned at\nthe maximum level and Company PSUs subject to patient share performance metrics have been earned at the target level. Such\nassumptions were made based on the Company\u2019s latest performance estimates for the applicable performance measures, as of\nAugust 15, 2022.\nSeverance Entitlements\nEach of the executive officers participates in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Severance and Change in\nControl Policy, which we refer to as the \u201cSeverance Plan\u201d. The Severance Plan provides for severance payments and\nother benefits in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d, which means a termination of employment by the Company\nwithout cause or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as described below) on or within the 12-month period\nfollowing a change in control of GBT. The Merger will constitute a change in control of GBT for purposes of the\nSeverance Plan. For purposes of the Severance Plan, \u201cgood reason\u201d generally means (a) a material diminution in the\nexecutive\u2019s job responsibilities (provided that a change in the executive\u2019s\n57\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\njob title or reporting relationship will not be deemed a material diminution in the executive\u2019s job responsibilities)\u037e (b) a\nmaterial diminution in the executive\u2019s then-current base salary\u037e or (c) the Company requiring the executive to be\nbased at an office location which is at least 25 miles from the executive\u2019s then-current office location.\nIn the event of a qualifying termination, each executive officer would be entitled to receive: (a) a lump-sum cash\npayment equal to the product of (1) the executive\u2019s applicable multiple (which is 1.5 in the case of Dr. Love and 1.0 in\nthe case of all other executive officers) and (2) the sum of (x) the executive\u2019s annual base salary and (y) the\nexecutive\u2019s target annual cash bonus\u037e (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the portion of the year in which the Effective\nTime occurs (with the proration based on the executive\u2019s date of termination)\u037e (c) subsidized health and welfare\nbenefits premiums for 12 months (or 18 months, in the case of Dr. Love)\u037e and (d) outplacement services. Receipt of\nthe above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the applicable executive officer executing a release\nof claims in favor of the Company. The estimated aggregate value of the severance payments and benefits that the\nCompany\u2019s executive officers would receive in the event of a qualifying termination on or following the completion of\nthe Merger is $7,016,851. The foregoing estimate is based on compensation and benefit levels in effect as of August\n15, 2022. The executive officers\u2019 outstanding unvested equity awards would be treated as described above in the\nsection entitled \u201cInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity and\nEquity-Based Awards\u201d.\nThe Severance Plan provides that in the event that any payment or benefit (regardless of whether payable under the\nSeverance Plan or otherwise and including the acceleration of equity awards) payable to an executive officer in\nconnection with his or her separation from the Company would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of\nSection 280G of the Code, then such payment or benefit is only reduced below the limit under Section 280G of the\nCode if the executive officer would end up in a better financial position than receiving the full amount and paying the\n20% excise tax. The Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the\n\u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.\nContinuing Employee Benefits\nThe Merger Agreement provides that for a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time, Pfizer will,\nand will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who was an employee of the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, which we refer to as a \u201ccontinuing employee\u201d, subject to such\nindividual\u2019s continued employment, with (a) a base salary or base wage and target cash incentive opportunities that\nare, in each case, no less favorable than such continuing employee\u2019s base salary or base wage and target cash\nincentive opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) long-term incentive opportunities that\nare no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Pfizer, (c) severance benefits that are no\nless favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (d) other\nemployee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employee\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time.\nParent has agreed to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize a continuing employee\u2019s service with the\nCompany or any of its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger for all purposes, including determining such\ncontinuing employee\u2019s eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, under benefit plans in which continuing\nemployees will participate after the completion of the Merger (subject to certain exceptions), (ii) cause all preexisting\ncondition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods applicable to continuing\nemployees under the Company\u2019s or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s welfare plans to be waived, to the extent such\nlimitations were waived or satisfied prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide continuing employees with credit\nunder any such welfare plan for any co-payments or deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time.\nWith respect to annual bonuses payable under the Company\u2019s annual bonus plan with respect to fiscal year 2022, if\nClosing occurs prior to the payment of such bonuses, Pfizer has agreed to pay such bonuses in accordance with the\nterms of the annual bonus plan and fund the payment pool at no less than the level at which such pool would have\nbeen funded assuming achievement of the target level of performance.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninsurance policies following the Merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement\nrelating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Indemnification and Insurance\u201d.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger and\nthat will or may become payable to the named executive officer either immediately at the Effective Time (i.e., on a\n\u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or following the completion of the\nMerger (i.e., on a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis). The holders of shares of GBT common stock are being asked to approve,\non a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. Because the vote to\napprove such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Pfizer.\nAccordingly, if the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of shares of GBT common\nstock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to\napprove such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes\nto the tables below and above under \u201c-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The\nestimated values are based on (a) an assumption that the Merger is completed on December 31, 2022, (b) a per share\nMerger Consideration of $68.50, (c) the named executive officers\u2019 salary and total eligible bonus levels as in effect as\nof the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company\nPSUs held by the named executive officers as of August 15, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such\namounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and excluding any additional grants that may occur following such\ndate and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in\naccordance with their terms prior to December 31, 2022, and (e) an assumption that each named executive officer\u2019s\nemployment is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the named executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d\n(each, as defined in the Severance Plan) immediately following the completion of the Merger. In addition, the amounts\nindicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including\nassumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur\nbefore the completion of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive\nofficer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nThe amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section\n280G best-net cutback\u037e therefore, actual payments to the named executive officers may be less than the amounts\nindicated below.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers\nName\nCash \nSeverance\n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nBenefits\n($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nTed Love\n2,427,750\n23,475,035\n63,000\n25,965,785\nJeffrey Farrow\n988,000\n6,159,627\n45,000\n7,192,627\nJung Choi\n958,000\n6,159,627\n15,000\n7,132,627\nDavid Johnson\n988,000\n6,291,318\n45,000\n7,324,318\nKim Smith-Whitley\n1,020,000\n5,504,979\n45,000\n6,569,979\n(1)\nThe estimated amounts shown in this column represent (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the executive\u2019s\napplicable multiple (which is 1.5 in the case of Dr. Love and 1.0 in the case of all other named executive officers) and (2) the\nsum of (x) the named executive officer\u2019s annual base salary and (y) the named executive officer\u2019s target annual cash bonus and\n(b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022. The value of the\npro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022, for Drs. Love and Smith-\nWhitley, Messrs. Farrow and Johnson and Ms. Choi is $522,900, $255,000, $247,000, $247,000 and $239,500, respectively.\nThese payments are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d, as they will only be payable in the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d on or following the\nEffective Time.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(2)\nThe estimated amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate intrinsic value of the named executive officers\u2019 outstanding\nunvested Company Options (the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration of $68.50 over the applicable exercise\nprice) and the aggregate value of outstanding unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other than Stock Price PSUs, which\nwill be forfeited).

Love and Smith-Whitley and Messrs. Farrow and Johnson, the estimated amounts shown in this column\nrepresent the value of cash payments for a period of 12 months (or 18 months in the case of Dr. Love) following a qualifying\ntermination equal to the cost of continued health and dental coverage under COBRA and outplacement benefits. Since Ms. Choi\ndoes not participate in the Company\u2019s health insurance plan, she will not receive continued health and dental coverage under\nCOBRA and, therefore, the estimated amounts shown in this column only reflect the value of her outplacement benefits. The\nestimated value of outplacement benefits for each named executive officer is $15,000. These are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d benefits in that\nthey will be paid to the named executive officer only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of\nemployment under the Severance Plan on or following the Effective Time.\nNew Management Arrangements\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, there are no employment, equity or other agreements, arrangements or\nunderstandings between any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers, on the one hand, and Pfizer or the\nSurviving Corporation, on the other hand, and the Merger is not conditioned upon any of the Company\u2019s directors or\nexecutive officers entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.",

The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or\nless than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger\nAgreement. These rights are known as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal\nrights pursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would\notherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of GBT common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court.\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of GBT common stock\ndetermined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would\notherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth\nin Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result\nin the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of\nSection 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors\nbefore attempting to exercise such rights.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.

The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a\nrecommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or\nits appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nA holder of record of shares of GBT common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares\nthrough the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise\nwithdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not\nthereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a\nperson who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the\ndemand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement\nthat such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery\nList (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of GBT common stock\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the\nDelaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\nstockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to\nvote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to\na publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost.

In such case, the demand must set forth the\nnumber of shares of GBT common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of GBT common\nstock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of GBT common stock outstanding in\nthe name of such record owner.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give written notice that the Merger has\nbecome effective to each of (a) each GBT stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who\ndid not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and (b) any beneficial owner who has\ndemanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and\naccept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person\u2019s shares of GBT common stock\nby delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such\nattempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval\nof the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the person within sixty (60) days after the\neffective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court will be dismissed as to any person without the approval\nof the Delaware Court, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just. If the\nSurviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is\nrequired, or if the Delaware Court does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be\nentitled to receive only the fair value of such person\u2019s shares of GBT common stock determined by the Delaware\nCourt in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation and any\nperson who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in\nthe case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe shares of GBT common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the\npart of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise\nappraisal rights should assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation will not file such a petition or initiate\nany negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of GBT common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to\nhave their shares of GBT common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their\nappraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty\n(120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and\nany person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the\nMerger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied\nwith the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving\nCorporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of GBT common stock not consented in writing\nor otherwise voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the\nSurviving Corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within\nten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days\nafter the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the Surviving\nCorporation. The Surviving Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the\noffice of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock and with whom the\nSurviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (which we refer to as the\n\u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and\nplace fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving Corporation and to all such\nperson set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will\ndetermine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided\nthereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of GBT\ncommon stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of GBT common\nstock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any\nperson fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the\nDelaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\npersons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the\nDelaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of GBT common stock taking into account all relevant factors,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time\nand the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after\nsuch payment only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid\nby the Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhen the fair value of the shares of GBT common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of\nsuch value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of\nthe appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal\ncould result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover,\nthe Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any person exercising\nappraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant shares of GBT common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be\nascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such\nexclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only\nto the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness\nfees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a\nperson whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in\nconnection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of GBT\ncommon stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and\naward pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware\nCourt are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any\npurpose any shares of GBT common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to GBT stockholders of record at a date\nprior to the Effective Time.\nAt any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any\nperson without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the\nDelaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court\nmade under Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nperson\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the\nEffective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred twenty (120) days after\nthe Effective Time, or if the persons\u2019 otherwise fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose such persons\u2019 right to\nappraisal, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled\nonly to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the\nother hand, Section 262 will govern.",

This discussion is\nlimited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of GBT common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d)\n(generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated\nunder the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the\n\u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to\nchange or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing\ninterpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance\ncan be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax\nconsiderations described in this discussion. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of\ncounsel has or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Merger.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the\nU.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and\ncircumstances, or to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of\nGBT common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations\nand pension funds\u037e\n65TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nholders that hold shares of GBT common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle\u201d, hedge, constructive sale, or other\nintegrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships, other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\n\u201cS corporations\u201d, or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in\nsuch entities)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned at any time (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of GBT\ncommon stock (by vote or value)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of GBT common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-\nqualified retirement plan, pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants or otherwise as compensation\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nexpatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\nholders subject to any alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\ngrantor trusts\u037e\n\u2022\ncontrolled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that hold their GBT common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch\nthereof, located, organized or resident outside of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that exercise their appraisal rights in connection with the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own, directly, indirectly or constructively, an equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e\nand\n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to GBT common\nstock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.\nThis discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations\nother than those pertaining to the income tax (such as the federal estate or gift tax, any alternative minimum tax, or the\napplication of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code) or any state, local or non-\nU.S. income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations in\nrespect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the\nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection\ntherewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This discussion\ndoes not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the Merger.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of GBT common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and\ncertain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of GBT\ncommon stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR GBT STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE GBT STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX\nCIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX\nCONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,\nINCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S.\nINCOME, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of GBT common stock that is for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration\nof such trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority\nto control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of GBT common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or\narrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.\nHolder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received\npursuant to the Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of GBT common stock surrendered\npursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of GBT common stock will generally equal the\namount that such U.S. Holder paid for such shares. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of GBT\ncommon stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss, and any such capital gain or loss generally will\nbe long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time\nof the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are generally\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a\nU.S. Holder acquired different blocks of GBT common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder\nmust determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of GBT common stock\nthat it holds.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nIn general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S.\nHolder in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business\nconducted by the non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty,\nis attributable to the non-U.S. Holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the Merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of GBT common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of GBT\u2019s status as\na \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code\n(which we refer to as a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date\nof the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of GBT common\nstock (which we refer to as the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis\nin substantially the same manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty\nprovides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be\nsubject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable\nincome tax treaty) on its \u201ceffectively connected earnings and profits\u201d for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain\nitems.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a\nrate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which\ngenerally may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year (if\nany), provided the non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, GBT believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the\nfive-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time. Even if GBT is or was a USRPHC during the Relevant\nPeriod, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder\u2019s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant\nto the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the GBT common stock is \u201cregularly traded\u201d, as defined\nin applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder owned, actually\nand constructively, 5% or less of the GBT common stock throughout the Relevant Period.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-\nU.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder\npursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed\nand executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that\nsuch U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules.\nA non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%)\nunless the non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS\nForm W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status\nas a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder\nor a non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s or non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX\nCONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY\nSTATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF\nTHEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S.\nFEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS\nAND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nEach of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement) to cooperate in good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all\nactions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things\nreasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers\nand consents from, the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with any governmental entity\nwith respect to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) the defending or contesting\nof any proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nthereby, in each case as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other\nCovenants-Efforts to Consummate the Merger\u201d. The approvals required under the Merger Agreement include expiry\nor termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as the receipt of certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals.\n68TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, we cannot predict the\nexact timing of completion of the Merger because we cannot guarantee when all required antitrust and other required\nregulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or\nbeen terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day\nwaiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade\nCommission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer\nto as the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a\n\u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day\nwaiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request,\nunless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. GBT made\nthe filing required under the HSR Act on August 26, 2022, and we currently expect Parent to make the filing required\nunder the HSR Act by August 29, 2022, in which case the initial 30-day waiting period will be scheduled to expire at\n11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 28, 2022, unless otherwise extended.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary\nor desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nThe Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approval (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed\nbetween the parties) in Germany (pursuant to the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen\nWettbewerbsbeschr\u00e4nkungen)). The parties made the required filings with the German Federal Cartel Office\n(Bundeskartellamt) on August 26, 2022. If, prior to the Effective Time, a merger control inquiry is initiated by a\ngovernmental entity in certain specified jurisdictions, the Merger will also be subject to (a) regulatory approval in\nsuch jurisdiction or (b) confirmation that the inquiry has ended (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between\nthe parties). In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

The descriptions of the Merger\nAgreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all of the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are\ngoverned by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information\ncontained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(a) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (b) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (c) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by GBT, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties\nhave been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between GBT, Parent\nand Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable\nto such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. GBT stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries\nunder the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or\nany descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of GBT, Parent or Merger Sub\nor any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely\non the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of GBT, Parent and\nMerger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential\ndisclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent\nmay be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex\nA, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding GBT, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should\nread the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding GBT and our\nbusiness.

Parent shall take all steps necessary to provide or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent, on or prior to\nthe Closing Date, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to\nreceive cash pursuant to Section 1.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d).\nA-2TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(b)\u2003Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than\nthree business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent\nto mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time\nrepresented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) which were converted into the\nright to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify\nthat delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the\nCertificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customary\nand reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the\nCertificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for\ncancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may\nreasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in\nexchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented\nby such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07, and the Certificate so surrendered shall\nforthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered\nin the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name\nthe Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in\nproper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes\nrequired by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have\nestablished to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.\nNone of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such\ntransfer or other Taxes. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.08, each Certificate shall be deemed\nat any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of\ncash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such\nCertificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash\npayable upon surrender of any Certificate.\n(c)\u2003Treatment of Book-Entry Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no\nevent later than three business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause\nthe Paying Agent to mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder, as of the Effective Time of the Merger,\nof Book-Entry Shares in an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration,\nwithout interest, to which such holder is entitled hereunder. If payment is to be made in respect of any Book-\nEntry Shares to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered, it shall be\na condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes\nrequired by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Book-Entry Shares or\nshall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Book-Entry Shares were\nproperly transferred and that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the\nCompany or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such transfer or other Taxes.\n(d)\u2003Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the\noutstanding shares of Company Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for\nCompany Common Stock) shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by\nreason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of\nCompany Common Stock or other similar transaction, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such\nperiod, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable by Parent or the Surviving Corporation\npursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock\nsplit or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend or other similar transaction. Nothing in\nthis Section 1.08(d) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or\nrestricted by any other provision of this Agreement.\n(e)\u2003No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance\nwith the terms of this Article I as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be\ndeemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.\nAfter the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the\nA-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the\nSurviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in\nthis Article I.\n(f)\u2003Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned\nthereon) that remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to\nParent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger\nConsideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for\npayment of its claim for such Merger Consideration.\n(g)\u2003No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent\nshall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official\npursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been\nsurrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise\nescheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of\nsuch Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date, become the\nproperty of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled\nthereto.\n(h)\u2003Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as\ndirected by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be\npaid to Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of interest or income delay the\nreceipt by former holders of Company Common Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such\nholders\u2019 rights hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the\nExchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent\nto promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall, or\nshall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to\nensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such\npayments.\n(i)\u2003Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit\nof that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the\nposting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity\nagainst any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in\nexchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest.\n(j)\u2003Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving\nCorporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled\nto deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may\nbe required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), or under any other federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so\ndeducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes under\nthis Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.\nARTICLE II\n\u2003\nRepresentations and Warranties of the Company\nExcept as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with, or\nfurnished by the Company to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and publicly available on the\nSEC\u2019s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System at least one business day prior to the date of this\nAgreement (the \u201cFiled Company SEC Documents\u201d) (excluding any disclosures contained in any part of any Filed\nCompany SEC Document entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d,\ndisclosures of risks set forth in any \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d disclaimer, or any other precautionary or other\nforward-looking statements\u037e it being understood that specific historical factual information contained within such\nheadings, disclosures or statements shall not be excluded) or as set forth in the\nA-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nletter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the \u201cCompany Disclosure Letter\u201d), from the Company to Parent and\nMerger Sub (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered\nsections contained in this Article II, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify or apply to other\nsections and subsections in this Article II to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure\nalso qualifies or applies to such other sections and subsections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and\nMerger Sub as follows:\nSECTION 2.01.",
