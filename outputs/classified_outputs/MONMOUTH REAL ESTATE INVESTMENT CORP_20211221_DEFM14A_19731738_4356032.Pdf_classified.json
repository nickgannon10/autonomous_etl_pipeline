        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs a matter of course, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, management and outside advisors have regularly reviewed\nand evaluated Monmouth\u2019s strategic direction, financial performance, business plans, operations and portfolio in an\neffort to maximize value to its shareholders. In so doing, Monmouth has identified, and at times pursued, potential\nstrategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions.\nOn December 1, 2020, Blackwells, one of Monmouth\u2019s shareholders, delivered a letter from Jason Aintabi,\nBlackwells\u2019s Founder and Chief Investment Officer, to Eugene Landy, Chairman of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors,\nand Michael Landy, Monmouth\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, communicating an unsolicited, non-binding\npreliminary proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock in an all-cash transaction\nat a price of $16.75 per share (the \u201cInitial Blackwells Proposal\u201d). On the date of the Initial Blackwells Proposal, shares\nof Monmouth Common Stock closed at $14.80 per share on the NYSE. On December 8, 2020, a special meeting of\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the Initial Blackwells Proposal, attended by representatives of\nMonmouth\u2019s financial advisor, CSCA, and outside Maryland corporate counsel, Venable LLP (\u201cVenable\u201d). Following\nthat discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously determined that the Initial Blackwells Proposal was not\nin the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy\nconveyed the determination of the board of directors to Blackwells by letter.\nOn December 16, 2020, Monmouth entered into an engagement letter with CSCA under which CSCA would provide\ngeneral advisory services. Monmouth decided to engage CSCA based on, among other things, CSCA\u2019s substantial\nexperience in the REIT industry and Monmouth\u2019s long-standing relationship with CSCA.\nAfter market close on December 18, 2020, Blackwells delivered a revised proposal to Messrs. Eugene Landy and\nMichael Landy offering to pay $18.00 per share in cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth\nCommon Stock (the \u201cRevised Blackwells Proposal\u201d). On the date of the Revised Blackwells Proposal, shares of\nMonmouth Common Stock closed at $16.99 per share on the NYSE.\nOn December 20, 2020, Bloomberg News published an article reporting that Blackwells had offered to acquire\nMonmouth for $18.00 per share in cash, and on December 21, 2020, Blackwells issued a press release disclosing the\nRevised Blackwells Proposal, including the full text of Mr. Aintabi\u2019s December 18, 2020 letter that accompanied the\nRevised Blackwells Proposal. Following publication of the Bloomberg News article and Blackwells\u2019s press release, the\nshare price of Monmouth Common Stock increased $0.72 per share to a closing price of $17.71 per share on December\n21, 2020. Also on December 21, 2020, Monmouth publicly disclosed its receipt of the two proposals from Blackwells.\nOn December 22, 2020, CSCA received an inquiry from a large private investment firm primarily focused on global real\nestate, which we refer to as \u201cBidder A\u201d, indicating an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Monmouth.\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 23, 2020, prior to receiving a response from Monmouth regarding the Revised Blackwells Proposal,\nBlackwells delivered a written notice to Monmouth stating that it intended to nominate a slate of four director\ncandidates, including Monmouth\u2019s former general counsel, to fill the four director seats up for election at\nMonmouth\u2019s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Blackwells also stated that it intended to submit six non-binding\nproposals to be voted on by Monmouth\u2019s shareholders at the 2021 annual meeting.\nOn January 13, 2021, Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan as its additional financial advisor in connection with a possible\ndecision by its board of directors to explore strategic alternatives. Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan based on J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s substantial industry knowledge, its experience with strategic alternatives processes for other real estate\ncompanies and its prior experience working with Monmouth. Monmouth also entered into an additional engagement\nletter with CSCA dated as of January 13, 2021, expanding the scope of CSCA\u2019s engagement to include advising and\nassisting in connection with a potential strategic alternatives review process.\nOn January 14, 2021, at its regular quarterly board meeting, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors considered, among other\nthings, the Revised Blackwells Proposal. In addition to members of Monmouth\u2019s management, in attendance for\nportions of the meeting were representatives of CSCA, J.P. Morgan and Venable. Following various presentations by\nadvisors, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors further discussed the Revised Blackwells Proposal and unanimously\ndetermined that the Revised Blackwells Proposal was not in the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of\nthe board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy wrote to Blackwells to inform them of the determination of the board of\ndirectors. During the meeting, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors also determined, following a presentation by\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, that it would be in the best interests of Monmouth to explore potential strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale. To enable Monmouth\u2019s board of directors to undertake that review in an\nefficient manner, the board of directors decided to form a Strategic Alternatives Committee, consisting of four\ndirectors, Messrs. K.C. Conway and Scott Robinson (each an independent director) and Messrs. Michael Landy and\nKevin Miller, which committee would support the review process and make recommendations to Monmouth\u2019s board\nof directors.\nAlso on January 14, 2021, Monmouth publicly disclosed its board of directors\u2019 determinations to reject the Revised\nBlackwells Proposal and to conduct a review of Monmouth\u2019s potential strategic alternatives. Shortly following the\nannouncement, representatives of Bidder A contacted both CSCA and J.P. Morgan to reiterate Bidder A\u2019s interest in\nexploring a potential transaction.\nShortly after the January 14, 2021 meeting of the board of directors, at the request of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors,\nand with the assistance of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, Monmouth\u2019s management began preparing a Confidential\nInformation Memorandum to be provided to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction. During this period, J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA also received inquiries from a number of parties interested in participating in the strategic\nalternatives process.\nOn January 20, 2021, Monmouth filed suit in state court in New Jersey against its former general counsel and\nBlackwells seeking to bar its former general counsel from participating in the slate of directors nominated by\nBlackwells. Blackwells subsequently sent a litigation demand to Monmouth, alleging that Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors\u2019 decisions to file suit, and not to appoint an independent committee to consider the Initial Blackwells\nProposal and the Revised Blackwells Proposal, was a breach of the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties. Monmouth\u2019s\nboard of directors thereupon created a committee of independent directors to review the demand with the assistance\nof counsel.\nOn February 1, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors finalized a form non-disclosure agreement to be circulated to\npotential counterparties. In addition, on February 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA provided Monmouth with a draft list\nof approximately 90 potential counterparties, including financial sponsors, real estate investment trusts, sovereign\nwealth funds, pension funds, real estate managers and other financial and strategic investors that J.P. Morgan and\nCSCA believed could potentially have an interest in a transaction with Monmouth and likely would have the\ncapability to consummate such a transaction. Subsequently, based on feedback from Monmouth, the advisors added\nadditional potential counterparties to the draft list.\nLater on February 1, 2021, a meeting of the Strategic Alternatives Committee was convened. The Strategic\nAlternatives Committee reviewed and discussed the potential counterparties that had been assembled by J.P. Morgan\nand CSCA with input from Monmouth\u2019s management, noting that the list included numerous credible strategic and\nfinancial bidders. Following this discussion, the Strategic Alternatives Committee approved the proposed list.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 2, 2021, pursuant to the direction of the Strategic Alternatives Committee, J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Mr.\nMichael Landy began contacting the potential counterparties.\nOn February 12, 2021, Monmouth engaged Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (\u201cStroock\u201d) to act as legal counsel to\nMonmouth and its board of directors in connection with the strategic alternatives process.\nBetween February 2 and March 5, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors negotiated and executed non-disclosure\nagreements (each a \u201cNon-Disclosure Agreement\u201d and collectively, the \u201cNon-Disclosure Agreements\u201d) with 36\npotential counterparties that were contacted as part of the strategic alternatives review process, including with ILPT,\nEquity Commonwealth (\u201cEQC\u201d) and Bidder A. The Non-Disclosure Agreements generally included customary\nstandstill restrictions on the counterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth\nwaive such standstill restrictions.\nOn March 16, 2021, Monmouth received four preliminary, non-binding proposals, including proposals from each of\nEQC, ILPT, Bidder A, and a private owner and operator of industrial real estate in the United States, which we refer to\nas \u201cBidder B.\u201d The proposal submitted by EQC represented an all-stock transaction and provided for an exchange of\neach share of Monmouth Common Stock for 0.571 EQC common shares, representing an implied value of $16.22 per\nshare based on the trading price of EQC\u2019s common shares at the time of EQC\u2019s March 16 proposal. The proposals\nsubmitted by ILPT, Bidder A and Bidder B contemplated all-cash transactions with per share offer prices of $19.25,\n$18.30 and $19.50, respectively. None of the four preliminary proposals received by Monmouth addressed the ability\nof Monmouth to pay dividends in respect of Monmouth Common Stock during the period between the execution of a\ndefinitive agreement and the closing. Each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and Bidder B were invited to continue to\nparticipate in the next stage of the strategic alternatives process.\nBefore the deadline for the submission of revised proposals, various telephone calls and e-mails were exchanged\nbetween Monmouth and its advisors, on the one hand, and representatives of each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and\nBidder B regarding diligence and process matters. Additionally, during this period, ILPT, EQC and Bidder A also\nconducted tours of a large number of Monmouth\u2019s properties.\nOn April 20, 2021, EQC and ILPT delivered revised proposals and, the following morning on April 21, 2021, Bidder A\nsubmitted a revised proposal. Bidder B did not submit a revised proposal. ILPT\u2019s revised proposal consisted of an all-\ncash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a price of $18.50 per share. ILPT\u2019s offer noted that\nMonmouth may not pay any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing of the merger\nagreement and the closing of the merger. EQC\u2019s revised proposal provided for an all-stock transaction in which each\nshare of Monmouth Common Stock would be exchanged for 0.6638 EQC common shares, representing an implied\nvalue of $19.15 per share based on EQC\u2019s closing stock price of $28.85 per share on April 20, 2021 and, when added to\nthe $0.18 per share dividend payable to holders of Monmouth Common Stock on June 15, 2021 that had been\npreviously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, would result in an effective price of $19.33 per share of\nMonmouth Common Stock in light of EQC\u2019s expressed willingness to permit Monmouth to pay the previously\ndeclared dividend and to refrain from paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC\u2019s common stockholders in\nrespect of such previously declared $0.18 per share dividend. Bidder A\u2019s revised proposal consisted of an all-cash\noffer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock for a price of $19.00 per share. Bidder A\u2019s revised proposal\nprohibited the payment of any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing and closing of the\nmerger, which would include the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors, other than dividends necessary to maintain Monmouth\u2019s REIT qualification, and\nrequired that the stated price of $19.00 per share be reduced by the amount of any such REIT qualification dividends\npaid between signing and closing of the merger. The Strategic Alternatives Committee determined that an additional\nround of bidding was advisable, and that each of ILPT, EQC and Bidder A should be invited to submit \u201cbest and\nfinal\u201d offers the following week.\nOn April 23, 2021, ILPT informed J.P. Morgan that it was withdrawing from the process, explaining that it was not in a\nposition to improve its proposal.\nOn April 28, 2021, EQC and Bidder A each submitted best and final proposals. EQC\u2019s final proposal consisted of an\nall-stock offer with 0.67 EQC shares to be issued in exchange for each share of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting\nin a base offer price of $19.08 per share based on EQC\u2019s closing stock price of $28.48 on April 27, 2021. In addition,\nEQC\u2019s final proposal (including the revised draft merger agreement\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nattached thereto) provided for up to $0.36 of additional value to the holders of Monmouth Common Stock by\nallowing Monmouth to pay the $0.18 per share regular quarterly common stock dividend that had been declared in\nApril 2021, and to declare and pay an additional $0.18 per share regular quarterly common dividend prior the closing\nof the merger, without EQC declaring or paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC\u2019s shareholders. Bidder\nA\u2019s final proposal was an all-cash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a stated price of $19.51\nper share. Bidder A\u2019s proposal provided that the per share price to be paid in the merger would be reduced by the\namount of any dividends declared or paid by Monmouth on shares of Monmouth Common Stock between signing\nand closing of the merger, including the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors.\nAlso on April 28, 2021, several meetings of the Strategic Alternatives Committee and Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nwere held to discuss the final proposals received from EQC and Bidder A. Following extensive discussions involving\nMonmouth\u2019s advisors, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously approved the Strategic Alternatives Committee\u2019s\nrecommendation to accept the EQC draft merger agreement and final proposal, subject to finalizing documentation.\nBetween April 28 and May 4, 2021, Mr. Michael Landy, and representatives from J.P. Morgan, CSCA, Stroock, EQC\nand EQC\u2019s financial and legal advisors negotiated the merger agreement, and final confirmatory due diligence was\ncompleted.\nAdditional meetings of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors were held on April 30, 2021 to hear presentations by J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA with respect to their preliminary valuation analyses of the economic terms of the proposed\ntransaction with EQC and on May 4, 2021 to consider approval of the merger agreement. Following the delivery of\noral fairness opinions by each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, and an update on the terms and status of the merger\nagreement by Stroock, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger\nagreement and related matters. Later in the evening on May 4, 2021, Monmouth entered into a merger agreement with\nEQC and issued a joint press release regarding Monmouth\u2019s proposed merger with EQC.\nAmong the Non-Disclosure Agreements, the standstill restrictions in nine Non-Disclosure Agreements expired by\ntheir terms upon Monmouth\u2019s execution of the merger agreement with EQC. Following the execution of the merger\nagreement with EQC, Monmouth notified the counterparties for the remaining 26 Non-Disclosure Agreements that\nMonmouth was granting an irrevocable waiver of the standstill restrictions to permit the counterparties to submit a\nproposal, inquiry or indication of interest regarding a possible transaction to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and to\nmake a public announcement of any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest, so long as, in any such case,\nsuch counterparties did not engage in discussions or negotiations, or enter into any agreements or understandings,\nwhether or not legally enforceable, with any third party (excluding the counterparty\u2019s affiliates and representatives)\nwith respect to any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest.\nOn July 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA received a letter from Starwood Capital Group (\u201cStarwood\u201d) setting forth an\nunsolicited proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock for net cash consideration of\napproximately $18.70 per share, reflecting a stated purchase price of $19.51 per share reduced by the termination fee\npayable to EQC under the merger agreement executed on May 4, 2021 and the $0.18 per share dividend on shares of\nMonmouth Common Stock declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021. On July 15, Starwood\ndelivered an amended proposal, reflecting an increase of $0.18 per share in the consideration that would be paid for\nshares of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting in a net cash consideration of $18.88 per share, reflecting a stated\npurchase price of $19.51 per share reduced only by the termination fee payable to EQC (with no reduction for the\n$0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On July 21, 2021, a\nspecial meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing the July 8, 2021\nStarwood proposal, as amended on July 15, 2021, and determining a response. Following such discussion,\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously reaffirmed its support for, and recommendation in favor of, the then-\npending merger with EQC.\nOn July 29, 2021, the committee that Monmouth\u2019s board of directors had appointed to review the litigation demand\nserved by Blackwells advised the board of directors that it had completed its work and that it recommended that\nMonmouth not file suit against its board of directors. The committee determined, among other\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthings, that Monmouth did not have a duty to establish a special committee to review Blackwells\u2019s offer, and that the\nboard of directors had appropriately considered the potential benefits and harms of pursuing litigation against its\nformer general counsel and Blackwells before doing so. Monmouth\u2019s board of directors accepted this\nrecommendation.\nBetween July 27, 2021 and August 13, 2021, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives\nof each party\u2019s financial, legal and proxy advisors, periodically discussed the status of the proposed merger with EQC\nand the related proxy solicitations. On August 13, 2021, representatives of EQC submitted an offer letter to\nMonmouth proposing certain revisions to the existing terms of the merger agreement, including (1) an increase in the\nmerger consideration to $19.00 for each share of Monmouth Common Stock by increasing the exchange ratio from\n0.67 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock to 0.713 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock,\nwhich represented a 6.4% premium over the existing all-stock transaction based on the closing price of EQC\u2019s\ncommon shares on August 13, 2021 of $26.65, and (2) the option for Monmouth shareholders to elect to receive such\nconsideration in the form of cash, EQC common shares or a combination of cash and EQC common shares, in each\ncase, subject to proration based upon a maximum cash amount. The terms of EQC\u2019s revised proposal with respect to\npayment of dividends on shares of Monmouth Common Stock were consistent with the provisions of the original\nmerger agreement Monmouth entered into with EQC.\nFollowing receipt of EQC\u2019s offer letter, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives of\neach party\u2019s financial and legal advisors, conducted negotiations concerning the terms of an amended merger\nagreement. Monmouth\u2019s board of directors also met on August 13, 2021 and twice on August 15, 2021 to discuss\nEQC\u2019s offer letter and the proposed amended merger agreement. Following the delivery of new oral fairness opinions\nby each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA with respect to the revised financial terms of the transaction and an update on the\nterms and status of the amended merger agreement by Stroock, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously\napproved the execution of an amended merger agreement with EQC and recommended that Monmouth\u2019s shareholders\napprove the merger with EQC on the amended terms at a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for August 31,\n2021. In the evening of August 15, 2021, Monmouth and EQC executed the amended merger agreement and on the\nmorning of August 16, 2021, Monmouth and EQC issued a joint press release announcing entry into the amended\nmerger agreement with EQC.\nOn August 18, 2021, Monmouth received a new revised unsolicited acquisition proposal from Starwood. Starwood\u2019s\nrevised proposal provided for net cash consideration of approximately $19.20 per share of Monmouth Common Stock.\nThis revised offer represented a stated per share purchase price of $19.93 per share, reduced by the termination fee\nthat would be payable to EQC if Monmouth terminated the amended merger agreement with EQC (with no reduction\nfor the $0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth\u2019s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On August\n23, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing and\ndetermining what action(s) to take in response to the revised Starwood proposal. Following such discussion,\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously decided to reaffirm its support for the then-pending merger with EQC,\nand Monmouth issued a press release announcing this decision on August 23, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, at a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s shareholders held for purposes of voting on the proposed\nmerger with EQC, the holders of Monmouth\u2019s common shares did not approve Monmouth\u2019s proposed merger with\nEQC as required by Maryland law and the terms of Monmouth\u2019s charter. Later on August 31, 2021, Monmouth\nreceived a written notice from EQC terminating the amended merger agreement as a result of the failure of\nMonmouth\u2019s shareholders to approve the merger and requesting reimbursement of its out-of-pocket fees and\nexpenses pursuant to the terms of the amended merger agreement. Subsequently, after receiving documentation\nrelating to such out-of-pocket fees and expenses from EQC, Monmouth reimbursed EQC in accordance with the terms\nof the amended merger agreement. Blackwells subsequently indicated to Monmouth that Monmouth should convene\nan annual meeting of its shareholders.\nOn September 7, 2021, Monmouth engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) to act as legal\ncounsel to Monmouth and its board of directors in connection with its determination of what action(s) to take\nfollowing the termination of the amended merger agreement with EQC.\nOn September 13, 2021, Monmouth issued a press release announcing that it was re-initiating the process of\nexploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger, joint ventures, and changes in the capital\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstructure of Monmouth, and that it would consider all viable proposals, including proposals submitted by Starwood\nor other potential counterparties. Monmouth also announced that it would set meeting and record dates for\nMonmouth\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders in due course.\nOn September 14, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the timeline for the\nrenewed strategic alternatives process, potential counterparties and engagement with shareholders. In light of the\nfact that Monmouth had previously run a strategic alternatives process with numerous potential counterparties and\nentered into, and made significant public disclosure in connection with, the EQC transaction, which had since been\nterminated, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors determined to proceed with the renewed strategic alternatives process on\nan accelerated timetable, in order to determine in short order whether an alternative transaction that would provide for\nan acquisition of the whole company could be achieved on terms that would be in the best interests of Monmouth\nand its shareholders. In addition, the board of directors determined that the renewed strategic alternatives process\nwould be overseen by the board of directors as a whole (and not the Strategic Alternatives Committee (which\ncommittee was disbanded)).\nBeginning on September 15, 2021, based on indications of interest gathered during the initial outreach to\ncounterparties in February 2021, Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial and legal advisors finalized a list of\npotential counterparties for the renewed strategic alternatives process and initiated contact with 22 potential\ncounterparties. All of the counterparties who had submitted a bid during the prior strategic alternatives process were\ninvited to participate in the renewed strategic alternatives process. Of the 22 potential counterparties, eight expressed\ninterest in participating in the renewed strategic alternatives process and were granted access to Monmouth\u2019s virtual\ndataroom to conduct due diligence. Five of the counterparties granted access to the virtual dataroom had already\nexecuted Non-Disclosure Agreements with Monmouth as part of the prior strategic alternatives process, and three\ncounterparties executed new Non-Disclosure Agreements, which included customary standstill restrictions on the\ncounterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth waive such standstill\nrestrictions. All counterparties were advised to submit indicative proposals by October 5, 2021. When invited to\nparticipate in the process, Blackwells indicated it would not be submitting an offer for Monmouth and declined to\nparticipate.\nBetween September 15, 2021 and October 4, 2021, members of Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial advisors\nheld a number of due diligence sessions with, and responded to documentary diligence requests from, the interested\npotential counterparties in the renewed strategic alternatives process.\nOn September 21, 2021, Monmouth engaged CBRE, Inc. (\u201cCBRE\u201d) to assist in Monmouth\u2019s exploration of joint\nventure alternatives. From its engagement until the execution of the Merger Agreement on November 5, 2021, CBRE\nreached out to and engaged with various potential joint venture partners.\nOn September 23, 2021, counsel for Blackwells wrote to counsel for Monmouth demanding that Monmouth file suit\nagainst Mr. Eugene Landy and other directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the matters\nraised in Blackwells\u2019s prior litigation demand and the now-terminated EQC merger agreement. Counsel for Blackwells\nalso demanded that Monmouth provide notice to shareholders of the date of its annual meeting by September 29,\n2021. Also on September 23, 2021, Blackwells submitted to Monmouth a revised notice of its intention to nominate a\nnew slate of four director candidates, which did not include Monmouth\u2019s former general counsel. Blackwells also\nstated that it intended to submit seven revised non-binding proposals to be voted on by Monmouth\u2019s shareholders\nat Monmouth\u2019s 2021 annual meeting.\nBetween September and November 2021, representatives of Monmouth and Blackwells had periodic discussions\nregarding Blackwells\u2019s proposals and its perspectives on Monmouth and a potential resolution of Blackwells\u2019s\ncampaign.\nOn October 5, 2021, Monmouth received preliminary, non-binding proposals from ILPT and two other counterparties,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cBidder 1\u201d and \u201cBidder 2.\u201d ILPT proposed to acquire Monmouth in an all-cash transaction for\n$19.25 per share. The proposals submitted by Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 represented all-cash acquisitions of Monmouth\nfor net consideration of $19.30 and $19.75 per share, respectively. ILPT and Bidder 1 indicated that they were ready to\nenter into definitive agreements for the acquisition within a short period of time, whereas Bidder 2 indicated that it\nwould need more time to undertake further due diligence. The bidders also indicated that they were exploring the\npossibility of providing an option to elect non-cash consideration for\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na portion of the transaction consideration. Bidder 1 indicated that it would permit Monmouth to pay its regular\nquarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, prorated until closing, without any reduction in the merger\nconsideration, while ILPT\u2019s and Bidder 2\u2019s proposals did not specify the treatment of dividends.\nOn October 6, 2021, Mr. Eugene Landy called Mr. John Murray, ILPT's Managing Trustee, President, and Chief\nExecutive Officer, to encourage ILPT to advance its participation in the renewed strategic alternatives process.\nLater on October 6, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the indicative\nproposals received from the three potential counterparties, attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and\nWachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton and of J.P. Morgan updated the board of directors on the\nprogress of the strategic alternatives process to date, structural options for a potential transaction, and possible\nbusiness and financial alternatives, such as a joint venture. Following discussion of the merits of various strategic\nalternatives, including remaining an independent company, joint venture, and a sale of Monmouth, Monmouth\u2019s\nboard of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to continue with the strategic alternatives\nprocess and engagement with the three counterparties. The duties of the board of directors were also discussed by\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton.\nOn October 7, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors, called representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2 to advise them that while Monmouth expected that\nthey would have to increase their proposed prices in order to enter into a transaction, they would be invited into the\nsecond round of the renewed strategic alternatives process. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA also provided\nall three potential counterparties with a draft of a merger agreement prepared by Wachtell Lipton. The counterparties\nwere advised to submit revised drafts of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton by October 22, 2021 for an\nopportunity to receive feedback in advance of their final bids, and to submit final proposals by November 1, 2021.\nAlso on October 7, 2021, Monmouth filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that it had set\nDecember 16, 2021, as the date for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, and that October 17, 2021 was the\ndeadline for the submission of shareholder notices of business to be considered at that meeting.\nBetween October 18, 2021 and October 21, 2021, members of Monmouth\u2019s management and its financial advisors\nparticipated in further due diligence sessions with representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2.\nOn October 22, 2021, representatives of Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP (\u201cHunton\u201d), ILPT\u2019s legal advisor, submitted a\nrevised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 did not submit\nmarkups of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton in advance of the final bid deadline.\nOn October 27, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided feedback to Hunton regarding its revised draft of\nthe merger agreement, including feedback regarding closing conditionality and the termination fee payable by\nMonmouth under the merger agreement under certain circumstances.\nOn October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 1 called representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA and indicated that\nBidder 1 would not be able to increase its previous offer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final\nbid deadline.\nAlso on October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 2 contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that,\nfollowing its evaluation of Monmouth\u2019s projected growth profile, Bidder 2 would not be able to increase its previous\noffer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final bid deadline.\nOn November 1, 2021, ILPT submitted its \u201cbest and final\u201d all-cash offer of $21.00 per share. ILPT\u2019s offer provided for\nMonmouth\u2019s ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends of up to $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until\nthe completion of the transaction, no financing contingency, and the expectation that Messrs. Eugene Landy and\nMichael Landy would enter into customary voting agreements to support the transaction. ILPT also indicated that no\nfurther diligence was required and it was prepared to finalize and execute the transaction documentation in short\norder.\nOn November 2, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was held to discuss the final offer received\nfrom ILPT, attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand CSCA advised Monmouth\u2019s board of directors of the progress of the strategic alternatives process to date,\nincluding ILPT\u2019s proposal, and presented certain preliminary financial analyses\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nregarding ILPT\u2019s proposal and the withdrawal of each of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nreviewed with the board of directors the terms proposed by ILPT, as well as open issues and remaining areas of\nnegotiation. Members of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors noted the compelling value that ILPT\u2019s offer represented.\nFollowing that discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to\nnegotiate with ILPT to seek to finalize definitive documentation for the transaction.\nLater on November 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors, called Mr. Adam Portnoy, ILPT\u2019s Managing Trustee, and representatives of Citigroup, ILPT\u2019s financial\nadvisor, to inform them of Monmouth\u2019s willingness to negotiate definitive documentation for the transaction with\nILPT, subject to agreement on certain terms, including a reduced termination fee, reduced expense reimbursement\nobligation of Monmouth, and shorter duration for ILPT\u2019s right to delay the closing under certain circumstances. ILPT\nand its representatives indicated that ILPT was prepared to agree to a transaction that reflected the terms proposed\nby representatives of Monmouth.\nOn November 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Hunton a markup of the merger\nagreement and Monmouth\u2019s disclosure letter to the merger agreement. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nand of Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the merger agreement and Monmouth\u2019s disclosure\nletter, until such documents were finalized.\nAlso on November 3, 2021, representatives of Hunton sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a draft form of\nvoting agreement for Messrs. Eugene Landy and Michael Landy. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and\nof Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the form of voting agreement until it was finalized.\nOn November 4, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth\u2019s board of directors was convened to consider approval of the\nmerger agreement with ILPT. In addition to members of Monmouth\u2019s management, in attendance at the meeting were\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with\nMonmouth\u2019s board of directors the key terms of the proposed final merger agreement. Representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand CSCA then reviewed their financial analyses of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement.\nFollowing their presentation, representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s oral opinion, confirmed the following day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the\neffect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be\npaid to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth\u2019s\ncommon shareholders, as more fully described below in the section \u201cThe Merger-Opinions of Monmouth\u2019s Financial\nAdvisors.\u201d Following their presentation, representatives of CSCA delivered to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nCSCA\u2019s oral opinion, confirmed later that day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the effect\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered\nand limitations on the review undertaken by CSCA in preparing its opinion, that the consideration to be received by\nMonmouth\u2019s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth\u2019s common\nshareholders. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also reviewed the directors\u2019 duties in connection with their\nconsideration and evaluation of the potential transaction. Following discussion, Monmouth\u2019s board of directors\nunanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and related matters.\nAlso on November 4, 2021, Monmouth, with the approval of its board of directors, entered into an agreement with\nBlackwells pursuant to which Blackwells would withdraw its proposals, support the proposed transaction and enter\ninto various standstill, solicitation and support arrangements.

        "Section Text": "Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWhile Monmouth has from time to time provided limited guidance to investors in its regular earnings press releases\nand other investor materials with respect to certain financial results and operational metrics for the then-current fiscal\nyear, Monmouth has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future\nperformance, earnings or results of operations due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and\nsubjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the evaluation of the now-\nterminated transaction with EQC, prior to the execution of the merger agreement for such transaction, Monmouth\nmanagement prepared and provided to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors, and to Monmouth\u2019s financial advisors, J.P.\nMorgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions in\nconnection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC, certain nonpublic, internal financial projections regarding\nMonmouth\u2019s future operations for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021, September 30, 2022, September 30,\n2023, September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2025, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2021, December 31,\n2022, December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025 (the \u201cprior Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information\u201d). In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, prior to the execution of the Merger\nAgreement, Monmouth management extended the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to the\nfiscal year ending September 30, 2026 and the calendar year ending December 31, 2026 and revised the projected\nfinancial information to reflect certain updated assumptions for such financial projections as a result of the passage\nof time since the preparation of the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information, including a delay in\nthe pace of acquisitions, reduced capitalization rates on acquisitions, reduced financing costs, and elimination of new\npreferred equity issuance (such extended and updated projections, the \u201cMonmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation\u201d) and provided the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to Monmouth\u2019s board of\ndirectors and to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial\nanalyses and opinions in connection with the Merger. As described below, the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information was also made available to ILPT and its financial advisor, as well as certain other prospective\ncounterparties who entered into a non-disclosure agreement as part of the process. For more information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger-Opinions of Monmouth\u2019s Financial Advisors.\u201d Monmouth has included below a\nsummary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information for the purpose of providing shareholders and\ninvestors access to certain nonpublic information that was furnished to J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Monmouth\u2019s board\nof directors in connection with the Merger. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not\nincluded to influence your voting decision with respect to the proposals set forth in this proxy statement to be voted\non by Monmouth shareholders. The inclusion of this summary should not be regarded as an indication that\nMonmouth management or anyone who received the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information then\nconsidered, or now considers, it to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information should not be relied upon as such. This information is not fact and readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.\nThe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and\ndoes not necessarily comply with published guidelines established by the SEC or by the American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections, but in the view of Monmouth\nmanagement, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the assumptions and estimates available at the time the\nMonmouth multi-year projected financial information was prepared. The Monmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation involves significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly\ntitled GAAP measures in Monmouth\u2019s historical GAAP financial statements. The Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information included in this section of the proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility\nof, Monmouth management. Neither PKF O\u2019Connor Davies, LLP (\u201cPKF\u201d), Monmouth\u2019s independent registered public\naccounting firm, nor any other independent accountant has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with\nrespect to the Monmouth multi-year\n49TABLE OF CONTENTS\nprojected financial information or any assumptions underlying the Monmouth multi-year projected financial\ninformation and, accordingly, PKF does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the Monmouth\nmulti-year projected financial information or its achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any\nassociation with respect to, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or the assumptions underlying\nthe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information. The report of PKF contained in Monmouth\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement, relates to Monmouth\u2019s historical financial information and does not extend to the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information or any other prospective financial information. Furthermore, the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was\nprepared.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Monmouth\u2019s business) that are\ninherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Monmouth management. Important factors that\nmay affect actual results and cause the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to not be achieved\ninclude, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Monmouth\u2019s business (including Monmouth\u2019s\nability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described in the\nsections of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the\nrisks described in the periodic reports filed by Monmouth with the SEC, which reports can be found as described\nunder \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d The Monmouth multi-year projected financial information also\nreflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time the Monmouth multi-year projected\nfinancial information was prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual\nresults may differ materially from those contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Monmouth\nshareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Monmouth for a description of the reported and\nanticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Monmouth\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement.\nThe inclusion of a summary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information in this proxy statement\nshould not be regarded as an indication that Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives considered the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to necessarily be predictive of\nactual future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information should not be relied upon as such\nnor should the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information be considered\nappropriate for other purposes. None of Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other\nrepresentatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Monmouth multi-\nyear projected financial information.\nMONMOUTH DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE MONMOUTH\nMULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE\nDATE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS PREPARED OR TO\nREFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE\nASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE\nNO LONGER APPROPRIATE. SINCE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nCOVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH\nSUCCESSIVE YEAR.\nMonmouth may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO (each as\ndefined below), using methodologies different from those used by other companies. Consequently, the financial\nmetrics presented in Monmouth\u2019s prospective financial information disclosures and in the sections of this proxy\nstatement with respect to the opinions of the financial advisors to Monmouth may not be directly comparable to\nthose of other companies.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMonmouth has not made and makes no representation to any Monmouth shareholder in the Merger Agreement or\notherwise concerning the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or regarding Monmouth\u2019s ultimate\nperformance compared to the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or\nthat the projected results will be achieved.\nMonmouth Multi-Year Projected Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited prospective financial information representing Monmouth\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation of Monmouth\u2019s estimated standalone future financial performance based on an internal\nfinancial model that Monmouth has historically used in connection with its annual budgeting and strategic planning\nprocess. The following Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was finalized on October 14, 2021. The\nMonmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on numerous variables and assumptions, including\nthe variables and assumptions discussed above, as well as the following material assumptions: (1) Cash NOI,\nAdjusted EBITDA (ex. Interest/Dividend Income), FFO and AFFO per share (each as defined below) projections\nbased on Monmouth\u2019s business plan for 2022 through 2026\u037e (2) acquisitions at initial cash capitalization rates of 4.5%\nto 5.9%\u037e (3) general and administrative expense at approximately 5% of total income\u037e (4) new debt issued at an\ninterest rate ranging from approximately 1.6% to 2.75%\u037e and (5) AFFO payout ratio at approximately 75% or higher.\nThe Monmouth multi-year projected financial information does not give effect to the Merger. The Monmouth multi-\nyear projected financial information was provided to Monmouth\u2019s board of directors and to J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and\nILPT, and a summary is presented in the following table, with all figures rounded to the nearest million, except per\nshare data. Monmouth\u2019s management directed J.P. Morgan and CSCA to use and rely upon the Monmouth multi-year\nprojected financial information for purposes of their respective opinions and related financial analyses.

The components of NOI consist of recurring rental and reimbursement revenue, less real estate taxes\nand operating expenses, such as insurance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Monmouth defines Cash NOI as NOI as adjusted\nto exclude the impact of certain GAAP adjustments included in rental revenue, such as straight-line rent adjustments and\namortization of above-market intangible lease assets and below-market lease intangible liabilities.\n(2)\nMonmouth defines adjusted EBITDA (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) as Net Income (Loss), as such term is defined under GAAP,\nattributable to Monmouth\u2019s common shareholders, plus preferred dividend expense, interest expense, including amortization of\nfinancing costs, depreciation, amortization of capitalized lease costs and intangible assets, non-recurring strategic alternatives and\nproxy costs (including litigation and certain other non-routine costs) and unrealized holding losses arising during the relevant\nperiod, less gain on sale of securities transactions and gain on sale of real estate investments. The Adjusted EBITDA item set\nforth in the tables above also excludes interest and dividend income.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(3)\nMonmouth defines funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) as such term is defined by The National Association of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (Nareit). Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common shareholders, as defined under GAAP,\nexcluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real\nestate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the Nareit FFO\nWhite Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation of Nareit\nFFO to make an election to include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity\nsecurities. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, Monmouth\nhas elected to exclude unrealized gains and losses from its investments in marketable equity securities from our FFO calculation.\nNareit created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.\n(4)\nMonmouth defines adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) as FFO as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense,\ndepreciation of corporate office tenant improvements, amortization of deferred financing costs, gains on the sale of securities,\nlease termination income, non-recurring costs relating to Monmouth\u2019s strategic alternative process and proxy fight (including\nlitigation and certain other non-routine costs), effect of non-cash GAAP straight-line rent adjustments and less recurring capital\nexpenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are defined as all capital expenditures that are recurring in nature, excluding capital\nexpenditures related to expansions at Monmouth\u2019s existing properties or capital expenditures that are incurred in conjunction\nwith obtaining a new lease or a lease renewal.\nIn addition to the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information described above, Monmouth management\nprovided to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses\nand opinions, unaudited unlevered free cash flow projections for Monmouth on a standalone basis for the three-\nmonths ending December 31, 2021, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2024, December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026 (\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d).
