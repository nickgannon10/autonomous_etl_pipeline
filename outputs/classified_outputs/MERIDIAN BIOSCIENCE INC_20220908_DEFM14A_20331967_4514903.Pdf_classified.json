The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as\namended, which we refer to as the \u201cHSR Act,\u201d which prevents Meridian and SDB from completing the merger until required information and\nmaterials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the \u201cDOJ,\u201d and the Federal Trade Commission,\nwhich we refer to as the \u201cFTC,\u201d and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. Meridian and SDB submitted the requisite notification and\nreport forms under the HSR Act on July 21, 2022. The parties withdrew and resubmitted the merger control filing to the FTC and DOJ on August 22,\n2022. The waiting period will expire at 11:59 PM on September 21, 2022.\nCFIUS Approval. The merger is subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d), which we refer to as\nthe \u201cCFIUS approval,\u201d which requires that Meridian and Columbus Holding: (i) have received written notice from CFIUS pursuant to Section 721 of\nthe U.S. Defense Production Act of 1950, which we refer to as the \u201cDPA,\u201d indicating that (i) CFIUS has concluded all action with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (ii) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the President\u2019s\ndecision on the CFIUS notice submitted by Meridian and Columbus Holding and either (A) the period under the DPA during which the President\nmay announce his decision to take action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nhas expired without any such action being taken, or (B) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend, prohibit or place\nany limitations on the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The parties submitted a formal draft filing relating to the merger to CFIUS\non August 19, 2022, and received comments from CFIUS on August 30, 2022.\nForeign Regulatory Clearances. The parties have also filed merger notifications on August 19, 2022 pursuant to foreign antitrust and foreign\ninvestment laws, and completion of the merger is further conditioned upon:\n\u2022\nreceipt of a clearance or non-objection from the German Federal Cartel Office and the Romanian Competition Council, or expiration of\nthe applicable waiting periods, or alternatively, if the matter is referred to the European Union, receipt of clearance or non-objection\nfrom the European Union, or expiration of the applicable waiting period\u037e\n\u2022\nthe approval or notification of non-objection to the merger from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy in the\nUnited Kingdom under the UK National Security and Investment Act 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\nreceipt of a certificate of non-objection from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action pursuant to the\nGerman Foreign Trade and Payment Ordinance of 2 August 2013, as amended by Article 2 of the Ordinance of 25 August 2021.\nAt any time, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the laws of their jurisdictions, which could include\nseeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seek to impose regulatory conditions on completion of the merger. Private parties may also seek to\ntake legal action under the antitrust laws\n5Table of Contents\nunder some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is\nmade, that it would not be successful.

Section 1701.85 of the OGCL generally provides that Meridian shareholders will not be entitled to such rights without strict\ncompliance with the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, and failure to timely take any one of the required steps may result in the\ntermination or waiver of such rights. Specifically, any Meridian shareholder who is a record holder of Meridian common stock on September 2, 2022,\nthe record date for the special meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, may be entitled to be paid\nthe fair cash value of such shares after the completion of the merger in lieu of any applicable merger consideration.\nTo be entitled to such payment, a shareholder must, among other things, deliver to Meridian a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of\nthe shares held by such shareholder with the information provided for in Section 1701.85(A)(4) of the OGCL before the vote to adopt the merger\nagreement is taken, not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. A\nshareholder\u2019s failure to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such shareholder\u2019s dissenters\u2019 rights as\nlong as such shareholder does not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

For shares listed on a\nnational securities exchange (such as NASDAQ, on which the Meridian common stock is currently listed) immediately before the effective time of\nthe merger, the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of the shares as of the close of trading on the day before the vote of Meridian\u2019s\nshareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement.\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cDissenters\u2019 Rights\u201d and the text of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, which is\nattached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference, for more specific information on the procedures to be followed in\nexercising dissenters\u2019 rights. Shareholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect\nto the exercise of dissenters\u2019 rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process and because failure to follow fully and precisely the procedural\nrequirements of the statute may result in termination or waiver of such rights.",

Meridian urges you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement\nand the full text of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, because the information in this section does not provide all the\ninformation that might be important to you with respect to the merger agreement, the merger and the special meeting. Additional important\ninformation is also contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nThe Meridian Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Meridian common stock in connection\nwith the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is the purpose of the special meeting?\nA:\nAt the special meeting, shareholders will consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting on the cover page of this proxy\nstatement, namely:\n\u2022\nthe adoption of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe approval of the compensation proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe approval of the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhere and when is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via the Internet on October 10, 2022 at 10 a.m., Eastern Time. We believe that hosting a virtual\nmeeting provides expanded access, improved communication and cost savings to our shareholders and Meridian, and aligns with our interests in\nthe health and safety of our shareholders and employees during this time when COVID-19 remains a concern. As such, the special meeting will be\nheld solely by means of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting online and to vote your shares\nelectronically at the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.\nQ:\nHow does the Meridian Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nA:\nThe Meridian Board unanimously recommends that you vote as follows:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the compensation proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will happen in the merger?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Meridian, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Meridian\nwill be the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding. As a result of the merger, Meridian common stock will\nno longer be publicly traded, and you will no longer have any interest in Meridian\u2019s future earnings or growth. In addition, Meridian common stock\nwill be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Meridian will no longer be required to file periodic reports with\nthe SEC with respect to Meridian common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.\n13Table of Contents\nQ:\nWho will own Meridian after the merger?\nA:\nImmediately following the merger, Meridian will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Columbus Holding. We anticipate that SDB will own\napproximately 60% of Columbus Holding and SJL will control (directly or through its affiliate) a special purpose vehicle that will own approximately\n40% of Columbus Holding.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive in the merger?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration of $34.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of\nMeridian common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of Meridian common stock, you are entitled to receive $3,400.00 in cash\nin exchange for your shares of Meridian common stock, without interest.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive in the merger in exchange for my equity awards?\nA:\nStock Options. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under the\nMeridian stock plans, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total\nnumber of shares of Meridian common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price\nper share of Meridian common stock set forth in such option. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days)\nfollowing the effective time.\nRestricted Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian restricted share unit granted under the Meridian stock plans\nwill be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the number of\nshares of Meridian common stock underlying the Meridian restricted share unit. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10\nbusiness days) following the effective time\u037e provided, however, that the cash payments in respect of four restricted share unit grants made in\nconnection with Meridian\u2019s acquisition of EUPROTEIN Inc. in April 2022 will not accelerate in connection with the merger and will be paid out in\nsubstantially equal installments in accordance with the remaining vesting schedule.\nPerformance Share Units. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding Meridian performance share unit granted under the Meridian stock\nplans will be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in respect of a number of shares of Meridian common stock equal to the\nnumber of shares of Meridian common stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for the measurement period at\nthe target level of performance. Such cash payments will be made promptly (and no later than 10 business days) following the effective time.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to dissenters\u2019 rights instead of receiving the merger consideration?\nA:\nUnder Ohio law, holders of record of Meridian common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly\ndemand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain dissenters\u2019 rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL if\nthe merger is completed. Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of the fair cash value of their shares should\nbe aware that the fair cash value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or less\nthan the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their shares. To be\nentitled to such payment, a shareholder must, among other things, deliver to Meridian a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the\nshares held by such shareholder with the information provided for in Section 1701.85(A)(4) of the OGCL before the vote to adopt the merger\nagreement is taken, not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Failing to\nvote does not waive a dissenting shareholder\u2019s dissenters\u2019 rights. However, a proxy submitted but\n14\nTable of Contents\nnot marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters\u2019\nrights. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL will result in the loss of dissenters\u2019\nrights. Please see the section entitled \u201cDissenters\u2019 Rights\u201d and the text of the Ohio dissenters\u2019 rights statute, Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the\nOGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their\nentirety.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?\nA:\nThe proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the total outstanding shares of\nMeridian common stock. A failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the compensation proposal?\nA:\nAssuming a quorum of Meridian shareholders is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of votes cast on the compensation proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to vote your shares\nof Meridian common stock or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the compensation proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?\nA:\nWhether or not a quorum of Meridian shareholders is present at the special meeting, approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of a majority of votes cast on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting. If you fail to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or\nabstain from voting, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal whether or not a quorum is present.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to\nMeridian\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s rules require Meridian to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will or may be made to\nMeridian\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For additional\ninformation, see the section entitled \u201cAdvisory Vote on the Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2).\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Meridian shareholders do not approve the compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe vote to approve the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the\ncompensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding on\nMeridian. Accordingly, while the Meridian Board intends to consider the vote resulting from this proposal, if the merger is completed, then the\ncompensation that is related to the merger will be payable to the extent that Meridian is contractually obligated to pay such compensation,\nregardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nIn order to complete the merger, the following conditions to closing must be satisfied: (i) Meridian must obtain the shareholder approval for\nadoption of the merger agreement, as described in this proxy statement, (ii) Meridian must receive the required regulatory approvals specified in the\nmerger agreement, (iii) the DOJ has not indicted Meridian or any of its subsidiaries on one or more felony criminal charges as result of the\n15\nTable of Contents\nDOJ Investigation, other than in connection with a negotiated resolution of the DOJ Investigation by Meridian in connection with the entry into or\nproposed entry into a deferred prosecution agreement, and neither Meridian nor any of its subsidiaries has been excluded from any Federal health\ncare program (each of which events must continue to be ongoing for the failure of this condition to be asserted), and neither of these two events\nare reasonably likely to occur, and (iv) certain other closing conditions under the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived by the parties. The\nparties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the merger in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, although Meridian cannot assure\ncompletion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be\ndetermined at this time.\nQ:\nDo you expect the merger to be taxable to Meridian shareholders?\nA:\nThe exchange of Meridian common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should read\nthe section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d and consult your tax adviser regarding the particular tax\nconsequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is September 2, 2022. Only common shareholders of record at the close of business on that date, or their\nduly appointed proxies, are entitled to attend virtually and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of\nMeridian common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nCommon shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 2, 2022, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. \u201cStreet\nname\u201d holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee) should obtain a specific control number from, and follow the\ninstructions provided by, their broker, bank or other nominee.\nWe believe that hosting a virtual meeting provides expanded access, improved communication and cost savings to our shareholders and Meridian,\nand aligns with our interests in the health and safety of our shareholders and employees during this time when COVID-19 remains a concern. As\nsuch, the special meeting will be held solely by means of remote communication rather than in person. You will be able to attend the special meeting\nonline and to vote your shares electronically at the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.\nQ:\nWho is soliciting my vote?\nA:\nThe Meridian Board is soliciting your proxy, and Meridian will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Morrow Sodali LLC, which we refer to as \u201cMorrow\nSodali,\u201d has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Morrow Sodali will be paid a fee of approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed\nfor its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be\nmade by mail and email. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the\nbeneficial owners of shares of Meridian common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.\nProxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Morrow Sodali or, without\nadditional compensation, by Meridian, or certain of Meridian\u2019s directors, officers and employees.\n16\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nCarefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its annexes. Whether or\nnot you expect to attend the special meeting virtually, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may\nbe represented and voted at the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock or an abstention from voting will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?\nA:\nIf you are a shareholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:\n\u2022\nInternet: To vote over the internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the internet, you do not have to mail\nin a proxy card.\n\u2022\nTelephone: To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a\nproxy card.\n\u2022\nMail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage paid envelope provided. If you return your\nsigned proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.\n\u2022\nVirtually: To vote virtually, attend the special meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VIVO2022SM.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the meeting virtually, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the\nmeeting and vote virtually if you have already voted by proxy. Please choose only one method to cast your vote by proxy. We encourage you to vote\nover the internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?\nA:\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive a voting instruction form\nfrom your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other\nnominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I submit my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you\nmay change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:\n\u2022\nYou may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before\nyour proxy is exercised at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nYou may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Meridian\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations at\nmbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Dr. Cincinnati, Ohio 45244 provided such written notice is received before your proxy is\nexercised at the special meeting\u037e or\n\u2022\nYou may attend the special meeting and revoke your proxy and vote virtually. Simply attending the special meeting virtually will not, by\nitself, revoke your proxy.\nIf your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you will have to follow the instructions provided by your broker or bank to change\nor revoke your proxy.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIf you have questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:\n509 Madison Avenue\nNew York, NY 10022\nEmail: VIVO@info.morrowsodali.com\nCall toll-free at (800) 662-5200 (in North America)\nor +1 (203) 658-9400 (outside of North America)\nQ:\nIf the merger is completed, how do I obtain the per share merger consideration for my shares of Meridian common stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the\nper share merger consideration. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for\nthe merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates or book-entry shares for\nthe per share merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may\nreceive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d\nshares in exchange for the per share merger consideration.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock now or with your proxy card.\nIf the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging\nyour shares of common stock for the per share merger consideration.\nQ:\nHow many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Meridian common stock issued and outstanding and\nentitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of\na quorum to be present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Meridian to additional expense.\nQ:\nWhat if I abstain from voting?\nA:\nIf you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares will still be counted for\npurposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Abstentions and a failure to vote your shares of Meridian common stock (including the failure of\na record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker to give voting\ninstructions to the broker) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. However, if you fail to vote\nyour shares of Meridian common stock or abstain from voting, it will have no effect on the outcome of the compensation proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present at the special meeting) or the adjournment proposal (whether or not a quorum is present at the special meeting). For shares of\nMeridian common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d only shares of Meridian common stock affirmatively voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.\n18\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone, over the internet or virtually?\nA:\nIf you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote by telephone, over the internet or virtually, your shares\nwill not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote your shares at its discretion on\nroutine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy\nstatement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your\nshares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\nYou will have the right to receive the merger consideration if the merger is adopted by the Meridian shareholders and subsequently completed even\nif your shares are not voted at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\nA:\nBroker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker is not\ninstructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on\nsuch proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy\nstatement, if a beneficial owner of shares of Meridian common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting instructions to the broker, then\nthose shares will not be present virtually or by proxy at the special meeting. Consequently, it is not expected that there will be any broker non-votes\npresent at the special meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement and will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or, assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, the compensation\nproposal. For shares of Meridian common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d only shares of common stock affirmatively voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.\nQ:\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record,\nany shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered\nforms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a\nseparate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity\nmust be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the\naccount. Please vote each and every proxy you receive to ensure all your accounts are voted.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of Meridian common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you\nmay own some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker.\nIn these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you\nreceive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope\nthat accompanies that proxy card.\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the special meeting virtually, we encourage you to send in your proxy card or to vote by telephone or over the internet.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nMeridian intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be\nfiled with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Meridian files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Meridian shareholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of Meridian common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an\nindependent public company and shares of Meridian common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ. The merger agreement\nprovides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Meridian may be required to pay to Columbus Holding the\ntermination fee. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee Payable by Meridian\u201d for a discussion of the circumstances\nunder which such a termination fee may be required to be paid.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about Meridian?\nA:\nMeridian will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2021 Annual Report to Shareholders, including\nits Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, without charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to\nMeridian\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations at mbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Meridian\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on Meridian\u2019s Investor Relations website at\ninvestor.meridianbioscience.com. Meridian\u2019s website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or\naccessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to\nour website provided in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another shareholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to\ntwo or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Meridian and some brokers\nmay be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple shareholders who request a copy and share an\naddress, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in\nhouseholding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you\nwish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or\nMeridian if you are a shareholder of record by sending a written request to Meridian\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations at\nmbi@meridianbioscience.com or 3471 River Hills Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244, or by calling (513) 271-3700.

        "Section Text": "Effects on Meridian if the Merger Is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Meridian shareholders will\nnot receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, Meridian will remain an independent public company. In addition, if the\nmerger is not completed, Meridian expects that management will operate Meridian\u2019s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated\ntoday and that Meridian shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including,\nwithout limitation, risks related to the competitive industry in which Meridian operates and adverse economic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that\nthe price of Meridian common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Meridian common stock would\nreturn to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares\nof Meridian common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Meridian Board will continue to evaluate and review Meridian\u2019s business operations,\nproperties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify\nstrategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Meridian shareholders or if the merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Meridian will be offered or that Meridian\u2019s business, prospects\nor results of operation will not be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Meridian may be required to pay Columbus Holding a termination fee in\nan amount equal to $45,960,000. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee Payable by Meridian\u201d for details.",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of its ongoing evaluation of Meridian\u2019s long-term strategic plans and goals, the Meridian Board and Meridian\u2019s senior management periodically\nreview and assess Meridian\u2019s business, operations and financial performance, as well as the general state of the industries Meridian operates in, as they\nmay affect those plans and goals. Such review and assessment has included, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for\nmergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, and other financial and strategic alternatives, some of which were proposed to Meridian from\ntime to time by third parties on an unsolicited basis. In late 2019, Meridian began to consider the acquisition of Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. (which was\nannounced on February 19, 2020) and the Meridian Board began to monitor whether Meridian could become subject to unsolicited takeover attempts or\nactivist trading as a result of a decline in its stock price during 2019. In order to assist with the review and assessment of potential strategic and business\nalternatives, including the Exalenz acquisition, and evaluation of Meridian\u2019s market trading, and their financial implications, Meridian engaged Rothschild\n& Co as Meridian\u2019s financial advisor. On December 2, 2019, Meridian and Rothschild & Co entered into a letter agreement governing such engagement.\nThe Meridian Board selected Rothschild & Co to serve as Meridian\u2019s financial advisor due to, among other things, Rothschild & Co\u2019s extensive\nexperience in Meridian\u2019s industry and its familiarity with Meridian\u2019s business, together with the business of other strategic companies and financial\nsponsors that could be interested in acquiring Meridian.\nBetween December 2019 and April 2021, various financial sponsors periodically reached out to Meridian\u2019s management and expressed interest in various\nbusiness collaborations or potential strategic transactions with Meridian. In a number of those outreaches, the financial sponsors asked to partner with\nMeridian to acquire other companies or businesses.\nIn early April 2021, \u201cParty A,\u201d a financial sponsor with whom Meridian\u2019s management had periodically had informal contacts during the previous months,\nreached out to Meridian\u2019s management to discuss its interest in acquiring Meridian\u2019s diagnostics business.\n32Table of Contents\nOn April 26 and April 27, 2021, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian\u2019s management, representatives of Rothschild & Co\nand representatives of Keating Muething & Klekamp PLL, which we refer to as \u201cKMK,\u201d Meridian\u2019s long-standing outside corporate legal counsel, were\npresent. At the meeting, representatives from Rothschild & Co reviewed the outreach from Party A, the strategic transaction proposed by Party A\ninvolving a sale of Meridian\u2019s diagnostics business, and a preliminary financial analysis. The Meridian Board also discussed then existing market\ndynamics and the increase in value attributed to companies in the life science sector, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the\nMeridian Board expressed the view that Meridian was not for sale at that time and that the Meridian Board was optimistic about Meridian\u2019s standalone\nstrategy and its prospects in the near and long-term, consistent with the exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties, the Meridian Board\ndetermined that if it were presented with a proposal that it believed was in the best interests of Meridian and its shareholders, which would likely need to\nprovide for an acquisition of the entire company, then the Meridian Board would consider such an offer. To that effect, the Meridian Board instructed\nMeridian\u2019s management to work with Rothschild & Co to perform a market check involving Party A and identified other financial sponsors to inquire\nwhether they would have an interest in acquiring Meridian and, if so, to obtain an indication of the purchase price and other terms such parties would\noffer. We refer to this process as the \u201c2021 market check.\u201d Meridian refrained from including strategic operating companies in the 2021 market check at\nthat time, because, up to that time, Meridian had only been contacted by financial sponsors and had not had any interactions with strategic companies\nthat had expressed any interest in a potential acquisition of the company or other potential strategic transactions. In addition, the Meridian Board\nbelieved that strategic parties would not be interested in an acquisition of the whole company, including because of the disparate nature of the\ndiagnostics and life science business.\nAccordingly, in June 2021 and the following weeks, representatives of Rothschild & Co reached out to five other financial sponsors to inquire whether\nthey would have an interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with Meridian. Mr. Jack Kenny, Meridian\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and other\nmembers of Meridian\u2019s senior management had introductory meetings with representatives of four of those financial sponsors and with representatives\nof Party A. In each of those meetings, Mr. Kenny and the other members of Meridian\u2019s senior management provided a high-level overview of Meridian\u2019s\nbusinesses based on publicly available information.\nOn July 28, 2021, representatives of Rothschild & Co had a call with Party A. Party A indicated that it may be interested in an acquisition of all of\nMeridian, rather than just its diagnostic business, but that to do so it would propose to partner with another financial sponsor, Party B. Following the\nintroductory meetings, Meridian\u2019s management, prepared a management presentation and financial projections for Meridian. Party A, Party B and \u201cParty\nC,\u201d another financial sponsor contacted during the 2021 market check, entered into confidentiality agreements with Meridian, and in August 2021,\nMeridian provided the management presentations and the financial projections to those three parties. Afterwards, Meridian\u2019s management held additional\nmeetings with those parties to provide additional information regarding Meridian\u2019s businesses.\nOn September 14, 2021, Party C submitted a non-binding indicative proposal to acquire Meridian for $26.00 per share in cash. On September 14, 2021,\nMeridian\u2019s closing stock price was $19.60 per share. The other parties contacted in the 2021 market check, including Party A and Party B, ultimately\ndeclined to submit any proposals for the acquisition of Meridian.\nOn September 16, 2021, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co and\nKMK were present. At this meeting, the Meridian Board reviewed and discussed with Meridian\u2019s management, and the representatives from Rothschild\n& Co and KMK the indicative proposal submitted by Party C and the broader outcome of the 2021 market check, including the fact that no other party\nhad provided a proposal to acquire Meridian, and Meridian\u2019s current strategy, plan and prospects as a standalone company. Following such discussions,\nthe Meridian Board concluded that Party C\u2019s proposal undervalued Meridian and, in consultation with Rothschild & Co, determined that it was very\nunlikely that Party C would improve its proposal to a purchase price that would be acceptable to the Meridian Board or that any of the other parties\ncontacted in the 2021 market check would submit a proposal to acquire Meridian. Therefore, the Meridian Board decided to not engage further with Party\nC or any of the other parties at that time.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2021, representatives from Piper Sandler & Co., which we refer to as \u201cPiper Sandler,\u201d contacted Mr. Kenny to discuss a potential strategic\nopportunity for Meridian. On December 20, 2021, members of Meridian\u2019s senior management, including Mr. Kenny, held an initial call with representatives\nof Piper Sandler who indicated that a Korean party was interested in speaking with Meridian about potential business collaboration opportunities. In\nsubsequent conversations with representatives of Piper Sandler, Meridian\u2019s management learned that such Korean party was SDB, and that SDB was\npartnering with SJL to inquire as to whether Meridian was interested in considering strategic or business opportunities. On January 4, 2022, Meridian,\nSDB and SJL executed a confidentiality agreement. We refer to SDB and SJL collectively as the \u201cbuyer consortium.\u201d\nOn January 11, 2022, Mr. Kenny and other members of Meridian\u2019s senior management held an introductory meeting with representatives of the buyer\nconsortium, including Dr. Young Shik Cho, Chairman of SDB, Mr. Steve Sukjung Lim, Chairman and Managing Partner of SJL, and Mr. Sungjae Lee,\nManaging Director of SJL. During this conversation, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed a strong interest in some type of transaction\nor collaboration with Meridian, possibly a joint venture, a distribution partnership or an acquisition of Meridian. Meridian\u2019s management made clear in\nthat meeting that Meridian was not actively seeking to initiate a sales process for Meridian. At the conclusion of the meeting, the representatives of the\nbuyer consortium requested additional conversations to learn more about Meridian\u2019s business operations and in order to determine what type of\ntransaction or collaboration, if any, the buyer consortium might want to propose.\nOn January 26, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of KMK, were present.\nDuring such meeting, Mr. Kenny provided a summary of the introductory meeting of Meridian\u2019s management team with representatives of the buyer\nconsortium. The Meridian Board then discussed with Meridian\u2019s management team the possible strategic opportunities and instructed Meridian\u2019s\nmanagement to further explore whether the buyer consortium was interested in an acquisition transaction, distribution partnership, joint venture or other\ntype of transaction. During the discussion with Meridian\u2019s management team regarding potential next steps, the Meridian Board expressed the view that\nMeridian was not for sale at that time and that the Meridian Board was optimistic about Meridian\u2019s standalone strategy and its prospects in the near and\nlong-term, but, consistent with the exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties, if the Meridian Board were presented with an acquisition offer\nthat it believed was in the best interests of Meridian and its shareholders, then the Meridian Board would consider such an offer. The Meridian Board\nalso requested that Meridian\u2019s management be judicious in the use of its time engaging in discussions with the buyer consortium in order to avoid\ncreating significant distractions from the day-to-day operation of Meridian\u2019s business.\nOn February 3, 2022, Mr. Kenny and other members of Meridian\u2019s management team held additional conversations via telephone with representatives of\nthe buyer consortium and Piper Sandler to convey the message of the Meridian Board that Meridian was not for sale and that the Meridian Board had\nconcerns about distractions for Meridian\u2019s management. The representatives of the buyer consortium provided additional details regarding SDB\u2019s\nbusiness and indicated that they believed, based on the initial conversations, that Meridian would be a good strategic fit for the buyer consortium. At the\nconclusion of this meeting, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed its preference for an acquisition of Meridian\u2019s whole business, rather\nthan a collaboration, distribution arrangement or acquisition of just certain assets or one of the business units, and requested an in-person meeting in\nmid-February 2022 to further discuss the buyer consortium\u2019s interest. Following this conversation, Mr. Kenny informed John McIlwraith, the Chairman of\nthe Meridian Board, about the outcome of the meeting and the buyer consortium\u2019s interest in acquiring the entire company. Mr. McIlwraith then\nconvened a call with the Meridian Board to discuss the buyer consortium\u2019s interest and the desirability of an in-person meeting.\nFollowing those conversations, on February 14, 2022, members of Meridian\u2019s management consisting of Mr. Kenny, Mr. Tony Serafini-Lamanna,\nExecutive Vice President, Diagnostics, Mr. Charles Wood, Vice President\u2014Corporate Strategy, Business Development & Investor Relations, and Ms. Julie\nSmith, Senior Vice President, Controller & Principal Accounting Officer held a meeting with representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler and\nalso provided a tour of Meridian\u2019s facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. At this\n34\nTable of Contents\nmeeting, the representatives of the buyer consortium expressed that Meridian was a strong strategic fit with SDB and its affiliate BioNote, and for that\nreason, the buyer consortium intended to submit a non-binding expression of interest for the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of\nMeridian. At this meeting, Mr. Kenny reiterated that Meridian was not for sale, but that he would bring the buyer consortium\u2019s expression of interest to\nthe Meridian Board for consideration.\nOn March 3, 2022, at Meridian\u2019s request, the buyer consortium executed a new confidentiality agreement with Meridian on a form prepared by KMK. Mr.\nKenny had informed Mr. McIlwraith about the execution of a new confidentiality agreement, which Meridian\u2019s management deemed preferable before\nengaging in further discussions with the buyer consortium. This new form included a customary standstill provision that would fall away if Meridian\nentered into a definitive agreement providing for, among other things, a merger following which Meridian shareholders would own less than 50% of the\nvoting securities of the surviving company. On March 5, 2022, members of Meridian\u2019s management provided the buyer consortium with the financial\nprojections for Meridian that were used in connection with the 2021 market check, but updated for Meridian\u2019s actual financial performance for those\nperiods that had then transpired. We refer to these financial projections as the \u201cPreliminary Meridian projections.\u201d\nOn March 18, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a written, non-binding proposal (the \u201cindicative proposal\u201d) to Meridian under which the buyer\nconsortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $31.00 to $33.00 per share in cash. On March 17,\n2022, the closing price of the Meridian common stock was $25.67 per share. The indicative proposal stated that the acquisition would be completed\nthrough a to be formed entity that would be owned approximately 60% by SDB and approximately 40% by SJL and that the offer was not subject to any\nfinancing contingencies as the buyer consortium had sufficient financial resources to consummate the proposed transaction. In its indicative proposal,\nthe buyer consortium indicated additional key diligence materials that it would need to review to make a definitive proposal to acquire Meridian and noted\nthat the valuation range reflected the buyer consortium\u2019s limited insight into the growth assumptions underlying the Preliminary Meridian projections.\nThe indicative proposal stated that if the buyer consortium could gain greater conviction regarding the Preliminary Meridian projections it could\npotentially offer a higher price.\nShortly after Meridian\u2019s receipt of the indicative proposal, representatives of Piper Sandler reached out to representatives of Rothschild & Co to discuss\nthe content of the indicative proposal and to ask about Meridian\u2019s reaction to the indicative proposal.\nOn March 21, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian\u2019s management, and representatives of Rothschild & Co and\nKMK were present. At the meeting, representatives of KMK provided an overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Ohio law in the context of their\nconsideration of a proposal to acquire Meridian. Mr. Kenny then summarized the indicative proposal, as well as previous interactions described above\nbetween Meridian\u2019s senior management and representatives of the buyer consortium. The Meridian Board discussed the indicative proposal and\npotential responses, considering Meridian\u2019s standalone plan, the uncertainty and challenges created by the current economic environment, and the\nuncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as potential short- and long-term execution risks to Meridian\u2019s financial plan. Representatives of\nRothschild & Co reviewed their preliminary perspectives on the financial aspects of the indicative proposal. The representatives of Rothschild & Co\nexpressed the view that, from their initial review, the buyer consortium represented a credible group capable of completing a transaction of this size. The\nMeridian Board discussed potential next steps and directed Meridian\u2019s senior management to work with Rothschild & Co and KMK to further evaluate\nthe indicative proposal from a financial and legal perspective. The Meridian Board instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to respond to the\nbuyer consortium that the indicative proposal did not sufficiently value Meridian, but that the Meridian Board would agree to provide the additional key\ndue diligence information that had been requested so that the buyer consortium could increase its offer.\nFollowing such meeting, on March 22, 2022, the representatives of Rothschild & Co contacted representatives of Piper Sandler to clarify the details of the\nindicative proposal, including key diligence information requested\n35\nTable of Contents\ntherein, to request further information relevant to transaction certainty, to convey the decision of the Meridian Board that the indicative proposal did not\nsufficiently value Meridian and to seek confirmation that the buyer consortium was willing and able to increase the purchase price above the price range\nincluded in the indicative proposal.\nOn March 25, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting, during which members of Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co and\nKMK were present. In this meeting, representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed their preliminary analysis of Meridian and the indicative proposal and\ntheir discussions with representatives of Piper Sandler. The representatives of Rothschild & Co reported further that the buyer consortium, through Piper\nSandler, had clarified the financial data and projections that it was seeking from Meridian and indicated that on the basis of updated projections,\nadditional information providing confidence that the underlying assumptions used in preparation of those projections were reasonable, and the receipt of\nadditional financial and business diligence, including additional information regarding Meridian\u2019s life science business and strategy, a further indicative\noffer would likely be at the higher end of the $31.00 to $33.00 per share range.\nFollowing this discussion, the Meridian Board instructed Meridian\u2019s management to inform the buyer consortium that the Meridian Board had considered\nthe indicative proposal, that Meridian was not actively in a process to sell the company, and that the indicative proposal did not sufficiently value\nMeridian. The Meridian Board also instructed Meridian\u2019s management to indicate that the Meridian Board would, together with Meridian\u2019s management\nteam and its outside advisors, analyze an improved offer from the buyer consortium. The Meridian Board further instructed Meridian\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Rothschild & Co to provide the key diligence information, including the updated management financial projections, requested by the\nbuyer consortium in the indicative proposal so that the buyer consortium would be in a position to improve the indicative proposal.\nIn the same meeting, in order to provide a more efficient process for engaging with Meridian\u2019s legal and financial advisors on day-to-day aspects of the\nengagement with buyer consortium, the Meridian Board formed and authorized a special committee of the Meridian Board, comprised of Mr. Anthony P.\nBihl, Ms. Felicia Williams and Mr. John McIlwraith (the \u201cspecial committee\u201d), to act on behalf of the Meridian Board and Meridian in connection with the\nproposal by the buyer consortium and any other proposals to acquire the company, subject to continuing oversight by the full Meridian Board and\nwithout the power to approve a definitive transaction, which was reserved for the full Meridian Board.\nSubsequent to the meeting, Meridian\u2019s senior management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information of Meridian, which were derived\nfrom the projections for Meridian\u2019s business used during the 2021 market check and from regular updates regarding Meridian\u2019s financial conditions and\nprospects that had been provided by Meridian\u2019s management to the Meridian Board at prior meetings, and which we refer to as the \u201cUpdated Meridian\nprojections.\u201d As a result, the Meridian Board was familiar with the framework underlying the Updated Meridian projections that were later provided to the\nbuyer consortium. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d for further information relating to a summary\nof the Updated Meridian projections.\nOn March 28, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co informed representatives of Piper Sandler that Meridian would be willing to engage with the buyer\nconsortium on a limited basis by providing the additional key financial diligence information requested, including Meridian management financial\nprojections, and making members of Meridian management available to meet with senior representatives of the buyer consortium, with the expectation\nthat the buyer consortium would respond with an improved proposal, including robust deal certainty assurances. Following such conversation, on April\n5, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co provided representatives of Piper Sandler with the Updated Meridian projections that had been prepared by\nMeridian\u2019s management.\nOn April 7, 2022, Meridian\u2019s management provided a detailed presentation to representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler, including a\nreview of Meridian\u2019s strategy for its life science and diagnostics\n36\nTable of Contents\nbusiness units and a discussion of the framework for potential synergies between Meridian and SDB and its subsidiaries. Representatives of Rothschild\n& Co also attended. During this meeting, Meridian\u2019s management reiterated that the current proposal from the buyer consortium was not acceptable to\nthe Meridian Board.\nOn April 11, 2022, representatives from Meridian\u2019s management team met again with representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler to discuss\nsome of the assumptions underlying the Updated Meridian projections. Representatives of Rothschild & Co also attended. During this meeting,\nrepresentatives of the buyer consortium requested more detailed historical financial information for Meridian\u2019s business.\nOn April 13, the special committee engaged Jones Day to represent Meridian, the special committee and the Meridian Board in connection with the\npotential sale of Meridian. The special committee selected Jones Day to serve as Meridian\u2019s legal advisor in connection with the potential transaction due\nto, among other things, Jones Day\u2019s extensive experience in Meridian\u2019s industry and qualifications and deep expertise in merger transactions and the\nother matters that were to be considered by the Meridian Board.\nLater in the day, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, KMK\nand Jones Day were present. Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co summarized for the special committee the most recent\ninteractions with the representatives of buyer consortium and Piper Sandler, and Mr. Kenny described the additional diligence requests made by the\nbuyer consortium. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reported that the representatives of Piper Sandler had advised them that upon receipt of the\nadditional information, the buyer consortium would be better enabled to justify and present a higher price range in a revised offer.\nOn April 14, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co contacted representatives of Piper Sandler to inform them that the Meridian Board was expecting a\nrevised proposal from the buyer consortium that would include an increase in price based on the parties\u2019 discussions of the Updated Meridian\nprojections and underlying assumptions, and was seeking assurances that any remaining diligence requests would be limited.\nOn April 15, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a written, non-binding proposal (the \u201crevised proposal\u201d) to Meridian under which the buyer\nconsortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $33.50 to 34.00 per share in cash. On April 14, 2022,\nthe closing price of the Meridian common stock was $27.94. The revised proposal again confirmed that the offer was not subject to any financing\ncontingencies, as SDB had sufficient financial resources to consummate the proposed transaction, and that although the transaction would be effected\nthrough a to be newly formed joint venture entity of SDB and SJL, SDB would fully backstop the obligations of the buyer consortium under the definitive\nmerger agreement. The revised proposal indicated the buyer consortium\u2019s expectation that consummation of the proposed transaction would be\nconditioned solely on receipt of the requisite approval the Meridian shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals, including from the Committee on\nForeign Investment in the United States, and customary antitrust clearances from necessary jurisdictions. The buyer consortium indicated its confidence\nthat approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States would not likely be an impediment to completion of the transaction. The\nrevised proposal reiterated the buyer consortium\u2019s view that the diligence information provided by Meridian to date had continued to provide the buyer\nconsortium with limited insight into the drivers of the growth assumptions underlying the Updated Meridian projections as well as product line\nprofitability and indicated that access to further due diligence information requested in the revised proposal could allow the buyer consortium to provide\na specific proposed purchase price, rather than the revised offer price range.\nLater in the day, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, Jones\nDay and KMK were present, to discuss the revised proposal in detail. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed the terms of the revised proposal\nand its preliminary financial analysis of Meridian relative to the revised proposal. The Meridian Board, along with representatives of Jones Day and\nRothschild & Co then discussed issues of transaction certainty, the remaining due diligence information requested by the buyer consortium, and the\nbuyer consortium\u2019s sources of funds, noting that SJL indicated it\n37\nTable of Contents\nwould seek to raise funds from current investors in addition to the $1.6 billion of cash SDB held at that time. Following this discussion, the consensus of\nthe Meridian Board was that the revised proposal was not sufficiently compelling to warrant further negotiations with the buyer consortium. The\nMeridian Board directed representatives of Rothschild & Co to advise the buyer consortium of the Meridian Board\u2019s decision to reject the $33.50 to\n$34.00 per share range as a basis for further negotiations, but also communicate that the Meridian Board would be open to the buyer consortium\u2019s\nhighest and best proposal.\nOn April 16, 2022, after representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed the Meridian Board\u2019s decision to reject the revised proposal, a representative of\nPiper Sandler sent an email to representatives of Rothschild & Co stating that based on the information previously provided by Meridian, the buyer\nconsortium was not in a position to further increase the purchase price and was therefore terminating the discussions. The representative of Piper Sandler\nstressed that the buyer consortium\u2019s strategic motivation remained strong and that they were disappointed that a transaction was not possible at that\ntime.\nOn April 18, 2022, Mr. McIlwraith discussed Piper Sandler\u2019s message with the other members of the special committee, Mr. Kenny, and representatives of\nRothschild & Co and Jones Day. Based on those discussions, the special committee determined to not change the Meridian Board\u2019s decision with respect\nto the revised proposal. Mr. McIlwraith instructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to convey to representatives of Piper Sandler that Meridian\u2019s\nposition remained unchanged and discuss with them whether there was a way to continue the discussions with the buyer consortium. Separately, Mr.\nKenny called Mr. Lim to reiterate the special committee\u2019s position and discuss perceived differences in valuation. At the conclusion of this conversation,\nMr. Lim indicated he would reconsider and explore internally whether the buyer consortium could revert with a higher price range.\nOn April 22, 2022, the buyer consortium submitted a further revised written, non-binding proposal (the \u201cfurther revised proposal\u201d) to Meridian, under\nwhich the buyer consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price in the range of $34.00 to $35.00 per share in cash.\nOn April 21, 2022, the closing price of the Meridian common stock was $27.35. The further revised proposal was conditioned on the express\nunderstanding that the buyer consortium would receive the previously requested due diligence information and that the buyer consortium would be able\nto achieve a sufficient level of comfort that the Updated Meridian projections are reasonable and achievable on a stand-alone basis. In the further revised\nproposal, the buyer consortium requested that Meridian agree to a 40-day period during which Meridian would negotiate exclusively with the buyer\nconsortium regarding a sale transaction.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management, and representatives of Rothschild & Co, Jones\nDay, and KMK were present. At this meeting, the representatives of Jones Day discussed with the directors their fiduciary duties in the context of a\npotential strategic transaction. Meridian\u2019s senior management, and representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co then reviewed with the Meridian\nBoard the further revised proposal in detail. The representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed its preliminary financial analysis of Meridian relative to the\nfinancial terms of the further revised proposal. After a discussion among the Meridian Board, Meridian\u2019s senior management and its advisors regarding\nthe current status of discussions with the buyer consortium, the deal structure and the timeline of the possible transaction, the Meridian Board decided\nthat in light of the revised offer range, Meridian should provide the requested further due diligence materials to the buyer consortium. The Meridian\nBoard also discussed the buyer consortium\u2019s request that Meridian agree to a 40-day exclusivity period. Consistent with the previous decision of the\nMeridian Board to not enter into exclusive negotiations with the buyer consortium, the Meridian Board determined that it would be more advantageous\nfor Meridian and its shareholders and consistent with the Meridian Board\u2019s exercise of its business judgement and fiduciary duties for Meridian to not\nenter into an exclusivity agreement with the buyer consortium at that point.\nFollowing such meeting of the Meridian Board, representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed to representatives of Piper Sandler the decisions taken by\nthe Meridian Board in response to the further revised proposal, including that in light of the revised offer range, Meridian would provide the requested\nfurther due diligence materials to the buyer consortium, but continued to reject the buyer consortium\u2019s request to enter into an exclusivity agreement with\nthe buyer consortium.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOn May 23, 2022 and May 24, 2022, Meridian\u2019s management provided further presentations to representatives of the buyer consortium and Piper Sandler.\nRepresentatives of Rothschild & Co also attended. Topics covered included operations, R&D, and strategy of the diagnostics and life science\nbusinesses, description of Meridian\u2019s human resources and regulatory capabilities, and details and assumptions underlying financial projections.\nAdditionally, Meridian management and Jones Day presented details on the status and chronology of the DOJ Investigation relating to the Magellan\nLeadCare product line. Representatives of Paul Hastings were present during the May 23, 2022 presentation.\nOn May 25, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings LLP, which we refer to as \u201cPaul Hastings,\u201d the buyer consortium\u2019s legal advisor in connection\nwith the potential transaction, a draft merger agreement governing the proposed acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium.\nIn the period from May 26, 2022 through June 23, 2022, members of the Meridian management team and representatives of Jones Day, Rothschild & Co\nand KMK held due diligence sessions with representatives of the buyer consortium, Paul Hastings and Piper Sandler on various topics, including\nfinancial, commercial and tax, the DOJ Investigation, trade and export control and other regulatory aspects of the proposed transaction, information\ntechnology and cybersecurity, data privacy, human resources and employee benefits.\nFrom June 1, 2022 through June 3, 2022, Mr. Kenny, Mr. Andrew Kitzmiller, Meridian\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and other members of Meridian\u2019s senior\nmanagement visited SDB\u2019s headquarters in South Korea. The discussions during this visit were focused on SDB\u2019s and BioNote\u2019s businesses and to\nfurther assess the buyer consortium\u2019s capabilities. Representatives of the buyer consortium also conducted a visit of SDB\u2019s and BioNote\u2019s facilities with\nMeridian\u2019s management team and discussed the operating plan for the combined businesses going forward. During the course of these meetings,\nrepresentatives of SJL requested that certain members of management agree to reinvest into the buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in\nconnection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium. The members of Meridian\u2019s senior management indicated that they would be\ninterested in remaining with Meridian in a long term role and would also be interested in potentially investing in Meridian, but that they could not agree\nto any proposals or arrangements at that time.\nOn June 6, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management team, and representatives of Rothschild & Co\nand Jones Day were present. At the meeting, Meridian\u2019s senior management team provided to the special committee an update on their visit to SDB\u2019s\nheadquarters in South Korea. Representatives of Rothschild & Co provided an update of the buyer consortium\u2019s diligence process and anticipated\ncompletion thereof. The special committee then discussed performing a further market check in advance of signing a definitive agreement with the buyer\nconsortium. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed with the special committee a list of certain potential strategic and financial buyers that had\nbeen previously discussed with Meridian\u2019s senior management, and Meridian\u2019s prior outreach to some of these parties in connection with the 2021 market\ncheck. The potential buyers on this list were selected based on their perceived likely interest in an acquisition of Meridian, and financial capability to\ncomplete a deal, as well as existing experience and activity in the industry, including taking into account that the transaction proposed by the buyer\nconsortium was for all of Meridian and certain parties may only be interested in Meridian\u2019s life science business or diagnostics business. After\nconsulting with Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of Rothschild & Co, the special committee instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co\nto contact a specified subset of the potential parties and balancing the risk that reaching out to parties that may not be interested in, or able to complete a\ntransaction with Meridian could put the sale process at risk if it was made public. The special committee then discussed: the risk of potential leaks\u037e the\npotential that the buyer consortium would disengage if it learned that Meridian was in discussions with third parties\u037e a no shop provision that the buyer\nconsortium would likely require to be included in a definitive agreement\u037e a termination fee that would likely be included in a definitive agreement\u037e and the\nability of potential acquirors to make offers after a definitive agreement has been signed and announced. The special committee determined that it was in\nMeridian\u2019s and its shareholders\u2019 best\ninterest to authorize the representatives of Rothschild & Co to conduct a market check with the identified parties\n39\nTable of Contents\nand instructed them to reach out to these parties, which comprised seven financial sponsors and six strategic operating companies. Rothschild & Co\npromptly began its market check efforts on behalf of Meridian.\nOn June 10, Jones Day received a revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. Among other items, this draft included a request by the\nbuyer consortium for certain members of Meridian\u2019s management to enter into employment agreements with Meridian concurrently with the execution of\nthe merger agreement and to reinvest into buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in connection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer\nconsortium.\nOn June 13, Jones Day discussed with Meridian\u2019s management the key issues arising from the revised draft of the merger agreement provided by the\nbuyer consortium as well as potential reactions and responses.\nOn June 15, 2022, as part of a status update call between the parties, Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller discussed with Messrs. Lim and Lee some of the\nmaterial issues identified by Jones Day in the revised draft of the merger agreement provided by Paul Hastings. Among the topics discussed were the\npotential treatment of the ongoing DOJ Investigation in the merger agreement, potential insurance coverage for the financial outcome of the DOJ\nInvestigation, maintenance of broad-based employee benefits plans post-closing, treatment of all equity awards in connection with a transaction, and\nreconfirming that the transaction will not be subject to any financing contingencies. Messrs. Lim and Lee confirmed that the buyer consortium intended\nto deliver its binding offer by June 24, 2022 and indicated that they will remain within the price range ($34.00 to $35.00 per share) previously\ncommunicated. Mr. Lim also reiterated the buyer consortium\u2019s request that certain members of Meridian\u2019s senior management enter into a commitment to\nreinvest into buyer a portion of the proceeds they would receive in connection with an acquisition of Meridian by the buyer consortium. On this point,\nMessrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller again indicated that they were interested in remaining with Meridian in a long term role and that they would be interested in\npotentially investing a portion of their merger consideration in Meridian following the closing, but that they could not agree to any proposals or\narrangements in this regard until, at the earliest, following execution of the merger agreement.\nOn June 16, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management and representatives of Rothschild & Co,\nJones Day and KMK were present. Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller provided a summary of their discussion with Messrs. Lim and Lee. After discussing\nwith representatives of Jones Day, the special committee determined and instructed that Meridian\u2019s management should refrain from negotiating any\npost-closing employment arrangements, including any potential future equity participation in the combined entity or any of its affiliates by any of the\nmembers of Meridian\u2019s management until, at the earliest, after the execution of any merger agreement. Jones Day then provided a detailed summary to the\nspecial committee of the revised draft of the merger agreement received from the buyer consortium. Jones Day reviewed with the special committee the\nkey issues included therein and proposed responses, including in relation to the DOJ Investigation and the proposal regarding the level of efforts that\nthe buyer consortium would commit to in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals.\nDuring the June 16, 2022 meeting of the special committee, Mr. Kenny also updated the members of the special committee that \u201cParty D,\u201d a global life\nscience investor, and its portfolio company, \u201cParty E,\u201d had reached out to Mr. Kenny and expressed interest in acquiring Meridian\u2019s life science business.\nHowever, they did not indicate any interest in also acquiring Meridian\u2019s diagnostics business. A discussion ensued whether Party D and Party E should\nbe added to the market check process. The special committee discussed the value of Meridian as a whole compared to the values of the life science and\ndiagnostic business units if they were to be sold separately, potential tax inefficiencies resulting from the separate sale of one of Meridian\u2019s business\nunits, and the fact that the remaining company comprised of only one of the two business units would not be large enough to be viable as a public\ncompany. Based on those considerations, the special committee expressed the view that the sale of Meridian as a whole would likely generate\nsubstantially more value for the Meridian shareholders than separate business unit sales and determined not to include Party D and Party E in the market\ncheck at that stage. The special committee determined to nonetheless keep the communication with Party D and Party E open in the event that they were\nto become open to an acquisition of the entire company.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn June 21, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day were present. The representatives of Jones Day reviewed\nthe status of negotiations of the merger agreement, including, among other issues, whether SDB would be a party to the merger agreement or only\nprovide a guaranty of the SDB/SJL joint venture that would be formed to acquire Meridian and regarding the treatment of governmental approvals\nnecessary to complete an acquisition of Meridian. The representatives of Jones Day also discussed with members of the special committee various\nalternative approaches that could be taken in response to the buyer consortium\u2019s positions. At the conclusion of these discussions, the special\ncommittee instructed Jones Day to respond to the buyer consortium\u2019s draft of the merger agreement consistent with the special committee\u2019s\ndeterminations.\nLater on June 21, 2022, Jones Day provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul Hastings reflecting, among other changes, the revised\nproposals for resolution of the key issues approved by the special committee.\nOn June 24, 2022, following the substantial completion of the buyer consortium\u2019s due diligence, the buyer consortium submitted its written final proposal\n(the \u201cfinal proposal\u201d) to Meridian, under which the buyer consortium would acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Meridian for a price of\n$34.00 per share in cash. The buyer consortium expressed in the final proposal that this price incorporated an estimated settlement amount (net of\npotential insurance reimbursements) relating to the DOJ Investigation. The buyer consortium also conceded in the final proposal to make SDB a party to\nthe merger agreement, directly undertaking the obligation to pay, or cause to be paid, the merger consideration. The final proposal indicated that the\nbuyer consortium intended to retain the current management team of Meridian and offer them a compensation program that is largely similar to Meridian\u2019s\nexisting compensation program, consisting of a base salary, annual cash-based incentives linked to performance and longer-term equity incentive\nopportunities that are in line with U.S. private equity standards. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Piper Sandler contacted representatives of\nRothschild & Co to indicate that the buyer consortium would be providing a revised draft of the merger agreement with the buyer consortium\u2019s proposed\nresolutions of the other remaining issues. On June 27, 2022, Jones Day received a revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. This draft\nincluded the buyer consortium\u2019s proposal to address risk allocation related to the DOJ Investigation as well as risk allocation on antitrust and foreign\ndirect investment approvals, including approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Due to the subjectivity of the proposed\nlanguage and the broad application of trigger events for a termination right of Columbus Holding, Jones Day was of the view that the approach\nintroduced significant risk to deal certainty.\nOn June 28, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting at which members of Meridian senior management, and representatives of Jones Day, Rothschild &\nCo and KMK were present. At the meeting, representatives of Jones Day provided the Meridian Board with a presentation of the key outstanding issues\npresented in the most recent draft of the merger agreement provided by Paul Hastings. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reviewed its preliminary\nfinancial analysis of Meridian and the $34.00 per share offer price proposed by the buyer consortium. The representatives of Rothschild & Co indicated\nthat for purposes of its preliminary financial analysis, Meridian\u2019s management had instructed Rothschild & Co to use the Updated Meridian projections\nprovided to the buyer consortium but revised by Meridian management for the periods through May 31, 2022 for Meridian\u2019s actual performance, which\nwas modestly lower than the Updated Meridian projections for such periods. Meridian management did not adjust the Updated Meridian projections for\nthe month of June 2022, but because the Updated Meridian projections were prepared on a quarterly basis, used one-third of the projected amounts for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2022 for the month of June 2022. Meridian\u2019s management had instructed Rothschild & Co to continue to use the forecasts\nincluded in the Updated Meridian projections for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and all following fiscal years included in the Updated Meridian\nprojections. The Meridian Board discussed with representatives of Meridian management Meridian\u2019s expected financial performance for the quarter\nended June 30, 2022, challenges associated with Meridian achieving the Updated Meridian projections, and potential risks associated with the DOJ\ninvestigation. The Meridian Board then discussed potential strategies in responding to the most recent proposal of the buyer consortium on both price\nand legal terms, how various Meridian shareholders may view the offer price included in the final proposal and potential reasons that the buyer\nconsortium had not provided an offer at the top end of their previously indicated range of $34.00 to $35.00. After discussion with representatives of\nRothschild & Co and Jones Day, the Meridian Board instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to challenge some of the financial assumptions\nthat had been made by the buyer consortium and, on that basis, ask that the buyer consortium increase its offer price to\n41\nTable of Contents\n$35.00 per share of Meridian common stock, the high end of the previously indicated price range. During the course of the discussions, the Meridian\nBoard also further discussed the lack of closing certainty associated with the buyer consortium mark-up of the DOJ and antitrust portions of the merger\nagreement. It was the consensus of the Meridian Board that the special committee, working with Jones Day, should provide feedback to the buyer\nconsortium indicating that the proposed treatment in the merger agreement of the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment\nmatters was unacceptable as it failed to provide a sufficient level of closing certainty. The Meridian Board also authorized the special committee, working\nwith Jones Day, to propose revised contractual provisions relating to the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals to\nthe buyer consortium.\nAt the June 28, 2022 Meridian Board meeting, Representatives of Rothschild & Co also reported to the Meridian Board that, by June 28, 2022, as part of\nthe market check previously authorized by the Meridian Board, Rothschild & Co (on behalf of Meridian) had reached out to various potential\ncounterparties that might be interested in acquiring Meridian, including seven financial sponsors, which, among others, included Party A, Party B and\nParty C that had also been included in the 2021 market check, and six strategic operating companies, to inquire whether they would have an interest in\nacquiring Meridian. Out of those parties, six financial sponsors, including Party A, Party B and Party C, and one strategic operating company, \u201cParty F,\u201d a\nlarge U.S.-based public company active in the same space as Meridian, executed confidentiality agreements with Meridian, while one financial sponsor\nand five strategic operating companies indicated for various reasons that they were not interested in an acquisition of Meridian. As part of the diligence\nthat such potential counterparties performed, Meridian provided to those parties who executed confidentiality agreements, among other materials, a\nmanagement presentation, certain financial information and the Updated Meridian projections. Due, however, to competitive sensitivity Meridian\nprovided Party F with a summary of the Updated Meridian projections, rather than a fully detailed set of projections. Rothschild & Co received verbal\nfeedback from Party C indicating that it would not be in a position to offer a price that would be materially higher than the $26.00 proposed in September\n2021. Except for Party C and Party F, all potential counterparties ultimately indicated that they would not be interested in acquiring Meridian, with a\nmajority citing concerns regarding Meridian\u2019s near and medium-term financial performance as the COVID-19 pandemic matures and COVID-19-related\ntesting continues to decline. Party F had requested additional diligence information that was broad in scope and competitively sensitive and Meridian\u2019s\nmanagement team reported that additional time to negotiate the scope of, and respond to Party F\u2019s request would be needed.\nOn June 29, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Jones Day reviewed with the special committee proposed responses to the material open issues discussed during the meeting of the\nMeridian Board the previous day, including with respect to the proposed price, approach to dealing with the DOJ Investigation and the insufficient\nproposal from the buyer consortium regarding the antitrust and foreign direct investment aspects of the merger agreement. The special committee\ndiscussed and determined proposed responses that would appropriately address the need for greater deal certainty and various strategic considerations\nand instructed the representatives of Jones Day to engage with representatives of Paul Hastings and respond as instructed by the special committee. The\nspecial committee separately instructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to provide a similar response on the key issues to representatives of Piper\nSandler. The responses provided by Jones Day and Rothschild & Co included (i) tying any conditions to closing of the merger in relation to the DOJ\nInvestigation to an objective standard of measure as to satisfaction and minimizing any such subjective standards of measure that could reduce deal\ncertainty, (ii) the expectation that the buyer consortium commit to a level of efforts satisfactory to Meridian to obtain the required antitrust and foreign\ndirect investment approvals and (iii) challenging the buyer consortium\u2019s financial assumptions in proposing a $34.00 per share purchase price, and\nrequesting that buyer consortium increase its purchase price to the higher end of the previously indicated price range. The special committee further\ninstructed representatives of Rothschild & Co to request that the buyer consortium increase its offer price and propose its best price for the Meridian\nBoard to consider.\nLater on June 29, 2022, representatives of Rothschild & Co conveyed to representatives of Piper Sandler the message discussed with the special\ncommittee and shortly thereafter, representatives of Jones Day discussed the same issues with representatives of Paul Hastings.\n42\nTable of Contents\nLater on June 29, 2022, Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller held a call with Messrs. Lim and Lee, to convey Meridian\u2019s responses on the key open issues\ndiscussed with the special committee. Messrs. Lim and Lee appeared to understand the Meridian Board\u2019s focus on, and need for, deal certainty.\nOn June 30, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting the points approved by the special committee.\nIn the morning of July 1, 2022, Mr. Lee, on behalf of the buyer consortium, responded to Meridian\u2019s challenge to the assumptions of the buyer consortium\nin offering $34.00 per share and request that the buyer consortium increase its price to $35.00. Mr. Lee stated that the buyer consortium was unable to\nfurther increase the price per share above $34.00 based on the Updated Meridian projections, its assessment of the underlying assumptions of the\nUpdated Meridian projections, and its own analysis. The buyer consortium further indicated to Meridian that it had concerns regarding Meridian\u2019s ability\nto meet the financial projections that had been provided to the buyer consortium. In the interest of reaching an agreement with Meridian as soon as\npossible, however, the buyer consortium nonetheless decided to remain within the previously communicated price range of $34.00 to $35.00, which from a\nvaluation standpoint the buyer consortium regarded as a \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal.\nLater in the morning of July 1, 2022, Paul Hastings, in accordance with the instructions provided by the buyer consortium, provided a revised proposal\naddressing the provisions of the merger agreement dealing with the DOJ Investigation, the antitrust and foreign direct investment control approvals and\nthe actions and divestitures that the buyer consortium will be obligated to undertake to obtain the required governmental approvals necessary to\ncomplete an acquisition of Meridian.\nOn July 1, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management, and representatives of Jones Day and\nRothschild & Co were present. The members of the special committee reviewed the revised proposal from the buyer consortium received earlier in the day\nfrom Paul Hastings. The special committee, working with representatives of Jones Day, discussed the risks posed by the construct regarding the closing\ncondition and termination right associated with the DOJ Investigation proposed by the buyer consortium, including the nature of certain of the proposed\nevents. Representatives of Rothschild & Co then joined the meeting and the special committee then discussed with representatives of Jones Day and\nRothschild & Co the likely timing for execution of a transaction with the buyer consortium, the current trading price of Meridian\u2019s stock and the response\nfrom the buyer consortium that it would be unwilling to increase its offer price above the existing $34.00 per share proposal. The special committee\ncontinued to be of the view that deal certainty was of paramount importance.\nDuring the July 1, 2022, special committee meeting, the special committee and representatives of Rothschild & Co also discussed the status of the\nprocess with Party F. The special committee instructed the representatives of Rothschild & Co to request a revised question list from Party F and offer a\ntime for a meeting during the week of July 4, 2022. The special committee concluded that it would be preferrable to meet with Party F in advance of\nexecuting a definitive agreement with the buyer consortium, if possible, but that transaction certainty was also of paramount concern. Members of\nMeridian\u2019s management expressed concerns about Party F\u2019s bona fide interest in acquiring the company based on the scope of the diligence requests\nand the lengthy period of time (almost three weeks) to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Meridian.\nBetween July 1, 2022 and July 4, 2022, representatives of Jones Day and representatives of Paul Hastings negotiated the outstanding issues to be\nreflected in the merger agreement.\nOn July 3, 2022, Mr. Lee sent a preliminary term sheet to Messrs. Kenny and Kitzmiller proposing a capital structure for the surviving company and that\neach of Messrs. Kenny, Kitzmiller, Serafini-Lamanna, and Dr. Lourdes Weltzien would invest 50% of such executive\u2019s after-tax merger consideration into\npreferred stock of the surviving company at the same price as SJL would subscribe for shares of preferred stock in the surviving company, but such price\nwas not proposed.\nOn July 4, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co and members of Meridian\u2019s senior\nmanagement were present. The representatives of Jones Day reviewed in\n43\nTable of Contents\ndetail with the members of the special committee the revised proposals provided by the buyer consortium addressing the treatment of the DOJ\nInvestigation and other matters, with a focus on the closing condition, and termination rights in favor of SDB. The special committee in coordination with\nJones Day determined a counterproposal to the outstanding issues and instructed Jones Day to provide Paul Hastings with a revised draft of the merger\nagreement reflecting such counterproposal.\nLater on July 4, 2022, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised proposal regarding the treatment of the DOJ Investigation. In the evening of July 4,\n2022, Jones Day received a further revised draft of the merger agreement from Paul Hastings. Such revised draft accepted Meridian\u2019s changes to the\nprovisions of the merger agreement dealing with the DOJ Investigation.\nOn July 5, 2022, the special committee held a meeting at which representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the meeting, the\nspecial committee discussed that the buyer consortium had provided the term sheet on July 3, 2022 and again expressed a desire to discuss proposed\nemployment and reinvestment terms with Meridian\u2019s management. After discussing with representatives of Jones Day and consistent with the Meridian\nBoard\u2019s and the special committee\u2019s prior directives, the special committee reiterated that Meridian\u2019s management should not negotiate employment or\npost-closing reinvestment terms at least until after execution of a definitive merger agreement. The special committee and representatives of Jones Day\nalso reviewed the proposed communications plan associated with the transaction and the most recent proposal from the buyer consortium regarding the\nantitrust provisions of the merger agreement. Consistent with the authorization of the Meridian Board at its June 28, 2022 meeting, the special committee\nthen authorized Jones Day to respond to the proposal regarding the merger agreement.\nLater on July 5, Jones Day provided to Paul Hastings a revised draft of the merger agreement, reflecting a few outstanding issues.\nOn July 6, 2022, the Meridian Board held a meeting (the \u201cJuly 6 meeting\u201d) at which members of Meridian\u2019s senior management and representatives of\nJones Day and Rothschild & Co were present. At the July 6 meeting, representatives of Jones Day again reviewed the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\nOhio law against the background of the final and best offer from the buyer consortium, the level of transaction certainty under the revised draft of the\nmerger agreement, the results of the market check performed by Meridian with the assistance of Rothschild & Co and other relevant factors. The Meridian\nBoard then reviewed the status of discussions with Party F. Representatives of Rothschild & Co reported that Party F had not responded to Rothschild &\nCo\u2019s request to schedule a meeting with a revised agenda. Meridian\u2019s senior management indicated that given the lack of a response from Party F to\nRothschild & Co\u2019s request to schedule a meeting and the time it took Party F to enter into a confidentiality agreement, they continued to have concerns\nabout Party F\u2019s bona fide interest in acquiring the company. After further discussions among the Meridian Board, including with members of Meridian\u2019s\nsenior management, and representatives of Jones Day and Rothschild & Co, the Meridian Board unanimously determined to not further pursue a\npotential transaction with Party F at this time, as it did not appear likely to the Meridian Board that Party F would provide a competitive offer to acquire\nthe company on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn the July 6 meeting, representatives of Jones Day also provided to the members of the Meridian Board an overview of the key terms and conditions of,\nand the remaining open issues raised in, the revised draft of the merger agreement, and the most recent discussions regarding those issues between\nrepresentatives of Jones Day and representatives of Paul Hastings, emphasizing the proposed resolutions reached between such representatives\nregarding the required antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals and the DOJ Investigation. The members of the Meridian Board concluded that\nthe proposed provisions addressing the DOJ Investigation and the antitrust and foreign direct investment approvals constituted an acceptable\ncompromise regarding these issues. The Meridian Board discussed with Meridian\u2019s management and representatives of Jones Day the last remaining\nmerger agreement issues and instructed the representatives of Jones Day on how they should resolve those issues with the buyer consortium and\nproceed to finalize the merger agreement.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIn the July 6 meeting, representatives of Rothschild & Co also reviewed Rothschild & Co\u2019s financial analysis of the Company and the proposed\ntransaction with the buyer consortium. Rothschild & Co then rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion dated July 6, 2022, to the Meridian Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and\nassumptions stated in such opinion, the $34.00 in cash per share of Meridian common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of Meridian common\nstock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nAt the conclusion of the July 6 meeting, the Meridian Board unanimously (1) deemed it advisable and in the best interests of Meridian and the Meridian\nshareholders to enter into the merger agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger\u037e (2)\ndetermined that the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement by Meridian are fair to and in the best interests of Meridian and the\nMeridian shareholders\u037e and (3) recommended that the Meridian shareholders adopt the merger agreement.\nEarly in the morning on July 7, 2022, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, following which time the parties issued a press release\nannouncing the transaction.",

        "Section Text": "Reasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Meridian Board consulted with Meridian\u2019s management and its outside financial and legal\nadvisors and, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the Meridian Board considered a variety of factors,\nincluding the following:\n\u2022\nMeridian\u2019s business, current and projected financial condition, earnings and prospects\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meridian Board\u2019s belief that the $34.00 per share merger consideration exceeds Meridian\u2019s likely value that could otherwise be achieved,\nincluding taking into account Meridian\u2019s potential for, and risks to, future growth as well as the potential value that could be realized from\nalternatives reasonably available to Meridian, including, but not limited to, special dividends or distributions, leveraged stock repurchases,\nan acquisition or a series of acquisitions, an asset sale or divestiture of a business segment of Meridian and the continued operation of\nMeridian on a stand-alone basis\u037e\n\u2022\nthe anticipated future trading prices of Meridian common stock on a standalone basis, based on management estimates and adjusted for\ndifferent scenarios, and the uncertainties of continuing on a standalone basis as a public company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing Meridian shareholders with certainty of value and liquidity upon\nconsummation of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nrecent and historical market prices for Meridian common stock, including the market performance of the Meridian common stock relative to\nthose of other participants in Meridian\u2019s sector and general market indices, and as compared to the merger consideration, including the fact\nthat the merger consideration of $34.00 per share represents an approximate premium of:\n\u2022\n32% to Meridian\u2019s per share closing price of $25.67 on March 17, 2022 (which is the day immediately preceding the date on which the\nbuyer consortium submitted the indicative proposal)\u037e and\n\u2022\n16% to the $29.31 per share of Meridian common stock based on the one-month average price per share of Meridian common stock\ncommencing on June 7, 2022, the date on which, at Meridian\u2019s direction, Rothschild & Co began contacting certain potential other\nacquirors of Meridian to determine whether another party may be willing to pay more than the buyer consortium\u037e\n\u2022\nthe opinion of Rothschild & Co, financial advisor to Meridian, that, as of July 6, 2022, and based upon and subject to the qualifications,\nlimitations and assumptions stated in such opinion, the $34.00 in cash per share of Meridian common stock to be paid to the holders (other\nthan excluded shares and dissenting shares) of shares of Meridian common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from\n45Table of Contents\na financial point of view to such holders, and the financial analyses related thereto prepared by Rothschild & Co and described below under\n\u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe course and history of the negotiations between Meridian and Columbus Holding, as described under \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014\nBackground of the Merger,\u201d including the Meridian Board\u2019s and management\u2019s belief that Columbus Holding\u2019s offer of $34.00 per share was\nColumbus Holding\u2019s best and final offer\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub agreed to (and agreed to cause their controlled affiliates and SJL to) use their\nreasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary governmental approvals with respect to the merger, including divesting assets as necessary\nto obtain any such approval, subject to certain limitations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meridian Board\u2019s belief, after consultation with Meridian\u2019s financial advisor, the 2021 and 2022 market checks conducted in the past two\nyears, and its knowledge of the industry and the operations of Meridian, that it was unlikely that any other financial sponsor or strategic\nbuyer (i) would be willing to acquire Meridian at a price in excess of $34.00 per share in cash, and (ii) would ultimately consummate the\ntransaction on terms similar to or more favorable to Meridian than those set forth in the merger agreement, even if Meridian were to conduct\nother solicitations of alternative acquisition proposals, including:\n\u2022\nthat positive macroeconomic and industry factors had increased demand for Meridian\u2019s products and services during and as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that such demand could subside as the pandemic moves to an endemic phase, and internal\nfactors, such as Meridian management\u2019s valuation and projections, each suggested that this would be an opportune time to explore a\nsale process and obtain maximum value for Meridian shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthat Meridian had conducted a lengthy and thorough process, both in 2021 and in 2022 since the buyer consortium submitted its\ninitial offer to acquire Meridian, involving outreach to 13 potential acquirers, of which seven entered into non-disclosure agreements\nwith Meridian and received due diligence, and no other potential acquiror provided an indication of interest or definitive proposal to\nacquire Meridian for $34.00 per share or more\u037e and\n\u2022\nthat the financial projections set forth in the Updated Meridian projections were subject to certain market and sector risks not viewed\nby Meridian\u2019s management as within the control of Meridian that, based upon the Meridian Board\u2019s knowledge of Meridian\u2019s\nbusiness and that potential counterparties and market analysts had expressed views with respect to broader sector conditions and\ncompetitive dynamics that might adversely affect Meridian\u2019s ability to realize the Updated Meridian projections\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Meridian Board\u2019s belief that the provisions of the merger agreement providing for the payment of a termination fee by Meridian, and\nother limitations applicable to, among other things, the ability of the Meridian Board to make a change of recommendation and review and\nconsider unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals were reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially\ncapable potential acquirer from submitting a proposal to acquire Meridian following the announcement of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Meridian\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors were involved in the negotiations and updated the chairman of the Meridian\nBoard, the special committee and the Meridian Board directly and regularly throughout the process, which provided oversight and\nadditional perspectives on the negotiations in addition to those of Meridian\u2019s management\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, under applicable Ohio law, the Meridian shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and\notherwise comply with the requirements of Ohio law would have the right to pursue their dissenters\u2019 rights under Ohio law if the merger is\ncompleted\u037e and\n46\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Meridian Board\u2019s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including, among\nothers, the following terms of the merger agreement:\n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Meridian Board believed are reasonable and customary in\nnumber and scope and are reasonably likely to be satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nrepresentations from SDB and Columbus Holding that they will have available all funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate\nmerger consideration, and the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\na review of SDB\u2019s balance sheet and consideration of its cash on hand and likely borrowing ability\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Meridian Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations\nwith a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the Meridian Board determines in good faith, after consultation\nwith its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be\nexpected to result in a superior proposal, and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its\nfiduciary duties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Meridian Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation that Meridian shareholders approve\nand adopt the merger agreement and, in addition, to cause Meridian to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an\nalternative acquisition agreement that constitutes a superior proposal, if the Meridian Board determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to\nbe inconsistent with its fiduciary duties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Meridian in the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to\nclosing would not be satisfied and also provide reasonable flexibility to operate Meridian\u2019s business during the pendency of the\nmerger, including with respect to actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e and\n\u2022\nMeridian\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to specifically enforce SDB\u2019s and Columbus Holding\u2019s\nobligation to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Meridian Board, in consultation with Meridian\u2019s management and Meridian\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors,\nalso considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that, subsequent to completion of the merger, Meridian will no longer exist as a public company and that the nature of the\ntransaction as a cash transaction would prevent Meridian shareholders from being able to participate in any value creation that Meridian\ncould generate going forward, as well as any future appreciation in value of Meridian\u037e\n\u2022\nthe covenants in the merger agreement prohibiting Meridian from soliciting other potential acquisition proposals, and restricting its ability\nto entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain conditions are satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Meridian would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $45,960,000 under certain circumstances, including the potential impact\nof such termination fee on the willingness of other potential acquirers to propose alternative transactions, although the Meridian Board\nbelieved that the termination fee was reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer\nfrom submitting a proposal to acquire Meridian following the announcement of the merger\u037e\n47\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe fact that Columbus Holding\u2019s, SDB\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to conditions, and the\npossibility that such conditions may not be satisfied, including as a result of events outside of Meridian\u2019s control, and the fact that, if the\nmerger is not consummated:\n\u2022\nMeridian\u2019s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant\ndistractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and Meridian will have incurred significant transaction costs\nattempting to consummate the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception of Meridian\u2019s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of customers, suppliers, distributors,\nbusiness partners, collaboration partners and employees\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of Meridian common stock could be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Meridian\u2019s business and relationships with customers, suppliers,\ndistributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees, including the risk that certain key members of Meridian management\nmight choose not to remain employed with Meridian prior to the completion of the merger, regardless of whether or not the merger is\ncompleted\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Meridian is obligated to provide Columbus Holding with notice of any acquisition proposal and the opportunity within four\nbusiness days of such notice, subject to extension under certain circumstances, to match any competing acquisition proposal that\nconstitutes a superior proposal, although the Meridian Board believed this would not preclude a potential acquirer from submitting a\nproposal to acquire Meridian\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Meridian has agreed to restrictions on the conduct of its business before completion\nof the merger, generally requiring Meridian to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry on its business in all material respects in the\nordinary course and, subject to specified exceptions, that Meridian will not take a number of actions related to the conduct of its business\nwithout Columbus Holding\u2019s prior written consent, and the possibility these terms may limit the ability of Meridian to pursue business\nopportunities that it would otherwise pursue, which actions could create additional shareholder value\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that certain of Meridian\u2019s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to,\nthose of Meridian\u2019s other shareholders. See \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Interests of Meridian\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Meridian has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the proposed\ntransaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the exchange of Meridian common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration represented a premium of 8.5% over the closing price of the Meridian shares on July 5, 2022, the day\nprior to the date on which the Meridian Board approved the merger agreement and the merger, which premium was lower than the premium\nto the price of the Meridian share at the time the buyer consortium provided the indicative proposal and lower than the premiums in certain\nother selected transactions.\nAfter considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Meridian Board concluded that the potentially positive factors\nsubstantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Meridian Board is not exhaustive but is intended to reflect the material factors\nconsidered by the Meridian Board in its consideration of the merger. In view of the complexity and the large number of the factors considered, the\nMeridian Board, both individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather, the Meridian\nBoard based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of the Meridian\nBoard may have given different weights to different factors. The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The foregoing discussion of the\ninformation and factors\n48\nTable of Contents\nconsidered by the Meridian Board is forward-looking in nature.

        "Section Text": "Certain Financial Projections\nExcept for annual guidance, Meridian does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance, and has refrained from making\nprojections for extended periods, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and\nthe uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Meridian is including in this proxy statement the Meridian projections (as defined\nbelow), which are a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of Meridian on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the\nmerger, in order to provide Meridian shareholders access to information that was made available to the Meridian Board in connection with its evaluation\nof the merger and the merger consideration. Preliminary Meridian projections were prepared by Meridian\u2019s management and made available to the buyer\nconsortium on March 5, 2022. Updated Meridian projections were subsequently prepared by Meridian\u2019s management and made available to the buyer\nconsortium on April 5, 2022, in connection with the buyer consortium\u2019s due diligence review. We refer to the Preliminary Meridian projections provided\non March 5, 2022 and the Updated Meridian projections provided on April 5, 2022 collectively as \u201cthe Meridian projections.\u201d\nThe Updated Meridian projections were made available to potential counterparties who executed a confidentiality agreement with Meridian in connection\nwith the market check performed by Meridian in June 2022 (see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger (Proposal 1)\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d for details\nregarding the market check). The Updated Meridian projections were also made available to Rothschild & Co in connection with its review and advice to\nthe Meridian Board and special committee regarding the financial terms of the merger and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. At the\ninstruction of Meridian\u2019s management, Rothschild & Co also used the Updated Meridian projections, as further updated for Meridian\u2019s actual\nperformance between April 5, 2022 and June 30, 2022 as further described in the tables below, in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the\nMeridian Board (see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of Meridian\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d for details regarding Rothschild & Co\u2019s opinion).\nThe Meridian projections shall be deemed to include for purposes of the disclaimers contained in this section, unless the context requires otherwise,\nother prospective financial information included below. Meridian advised the recipients of the Meridian projections that its internal financial forecasts are\nsubjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Meridian projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Meridian Board, Rothschild &\nCo, Meridian or its management or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future\nresults or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.\nThe Meridian projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Meridian projections were based are subjective in many respects and are\nsubject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of Meridian\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and\nbusiness developments. The Meridian\n59Table of Contents\nprojections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Meridian\u2019s revenue, margin and expense, and other\nperformance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult\nto predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond Meridian\u2019s control. Multiple factors, including those described in\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d could cause the Meridian projections or the\nunderlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Meridian projections will be realized or that actual results will\nnot be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Meridian projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less\nreliable with each successive year. The Meridian projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they\nwere prepared, including the merger. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of\nuncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Meridian projections will be achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Meridian projections in this\nproxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Meridian or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the\nMeridian projections is not provided to influence Meridian shareholders\u2019 decisions regarding whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other\nproposal. The Meridian projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained\nin Meridian\u2019s public filings with the SEC.\nThe prospective financial information, including the Meridian projections, were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance\nwith United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The prospective financial information,\nincluding the Meridian projections, included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Meridian\u2019s management. Ernst\n& Young LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial\ninformation, including the Meridian projections, and, accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto.

These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAccordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply\nto non-GAAP financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Meridian projections) in connection with a proposed transaction like\nthe merger when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP\nfinancial measures were not relied upon by\n1\nFor purposes of Rothschild & Co preparing its opinion dated July 6, 2022, Meridian\u2019s management instructed Rothschild & Co to use the Updated\nMeridian projections reflecting Meridian\u2019s actual performance through May 31, 2022. Actual performance through May 31, 2022 was lower than the\nforecast for such time period included in the Updated Meridian projections. Meridian management did not adjust the Updated Meridian projections for\nthe month of June 2022, but because the Updated Meridian projections were prepared on quarterly basis, used one-third of the projected amounts for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2022 for the month of June 2022. Using actual and estimated performance through June 30, 2022 resulted in (i) 2022E total\nrevenue of $346 million (compared to $351 million in the Updated Meridian projections), (ii) gross profit of $202 million (compared to $209 million in the\nUpdated Meridian projections) and (iii) adj. EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $102 million (compared to $108 million in the Updated Meridian projections).\nThese actual and estimated financial performance numbers had no effect on the Updated Meridian projections for 2023E, 2024E, 2025E, 2026E, or\n2027E.\n61\nTable of Contents\nRothschild & Co for purposes of its opinion or by the Meridian Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. Accordingly, Meridian has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Meridian projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe Meridian projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Meridian of the merger and do not attempt to predict or\nsuggest future results following the merger. The Meridian projections do not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating, executing,\ndelivering or consummating the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the merger, the effect on Meridian of\nany business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed or the effect of any\nbusiness or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered,\naccelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Meridian projections do not take into account the effect on Meridian of any\npossible failure of the merger to occur.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after any portion of the Meridian projections was\nprepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted\nreliance on the Meridian projections set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any investor or shareholder regarding the\ninformation included in the Meridian projections. Neither Meridian nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness,\naccuracy or completeness of the Meridian projections.

The Meridian Board\nwas aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger\nagreement and the merger, in approving the merger agreement and in recommending the applicable merger-related proposals.\nThe following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the merger for each person who has served as an executive officer or non-employee\ndirector of Meridian at any time since October 1, 2020.\ni.\nTreatment of Meridian Equity Awards\nIf the merger is completed, Meridian equity awards held by Meridian\u2019s executive officers, including the named executive officers, and directors will be\ncancelled and cashed out as follows:\n1.\nStock Options\nUpon completion of the merger, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Meridian common stock granted under the Meridian stock plans,\nwhether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of\nMeridian common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of Meridian\ncommon stock set forth in such option.

Mr. Kenny also serves as a member of the Meridian Board.\nUnder the Kenny employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Kenny\u2019s employment is terminated by Meridian without \u201ccause\u201d or Mr. Kenny terminates\nhis employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each as defined in the Kenny employment agreement), Mr. Kenny will be entitled to (i) continued base salary at his\nthen-current base salary rate for one year following such termination, payable in accordance with Meridian\u2019s normal payroll practices and (ii) a lump sum\npayment in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion of Mr. Kenny\u2019s target annual bonus during the year of such termination, payable on the date that\nannual bonuses are paid to similarly situated executives.\nIn addition, if, within 24 months following a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in the Kenny employment agreement and which includes the merger), Mr.\nKenny\u2019s employment is terminated by Meridian without cause or due to a failure of Meridian to renew the Kenny employment agreement, or if Mr. Kenny\nterminates employment for good reason, then upon such termination, Mr. Kenny will receive the following severance payments and benefits (in lieu of\nthose mentioned above):\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to two times Mr. Kenny\u2019s then-current annual base salary\u037e\n\u2022\na lump sum payment equal to two times Mr. Kenny\u2019s then-current annual target bonus amount (or, if higher, Mr. Kenny\u2019s annual target\nbonus amount as in effect in the calendar year preceding the change in control)\u037e and\n\u2022\n24 months\u2019 continuation of such benefits and employment privileges and/or perquisites as are afforded to other senior officers of Meridian.\nIn the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in the agreement or otherwise payable to Mr. Kenny would be subject to the excise tax\nimposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits under the agreement will be either delivered in full or delivered to a lesser extent\nwhich would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is more beneficial to Mr. Kenny.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe receipt of any severance payments and benefits pursuant to the Kenny employment agreement is conditioned on Mr. Kenny signing and not\nrevoking a general release of claims against Meridian. In addition, the Kenny employment agreement subjects Mr. Kenny to the following restrictive\ncovenants: (i) perpetual confidentiality, (ii) perpetual non-disparagement and (iii) non-competition and non-solicitation during employment and for two\nyears following any termination of employment.\nFor quantification of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Mr. Kenny in the event of a qualifying\ntermination immediately following the merger, see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\n2.\nChange in Control Agreements\nMeridian has entered into change in control agreements, which we refer to as \u201cCIC agreements,\u201d with the following executive officers: Dr. Lourdes\nWeltzien, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Life Science\u037e Mr. Tony Serafini-Lamanna, Executive Vice President, Diagnostics\u037e and Mr. Andrew Kitzmiller,\nChief Financial Officer (collectively, the \u201cparticipating executives\u201d). The agreements include an initial term that (i) ended December 31, 2016 for Dr.\nWeltzien, (ii) ended December 31, 2021 for Mr. Serafini-Lamanna, and (iii) ends December 31, 2022 for Mr. Kitzmiller, and, in each case, the term\nautomatically renews for additional one year periods\u037e provided, however, that in the event of a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in the CIC agreements and\nwhich includes the merger), the CIC agreements will expire no earlier than 24 months after the calendar month in which such change in control occurs.\nUnder the CIC agreements, if, within 24 months following a change in control, the executive\u2019s employment with Meridian is terminated for any reason\nother than (a) by Meridian for \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in the CIC agreements), (b) by reason of the executive\u2019s death or disability, or (c) by the executive\nwithout \u201cgood reason\u201d (as defined in the CIC agreements), then, subject to the executive\u2019s execution of a release of claims against Meridian, such\nexecutive is entitled to:\n\u2022\na lump sum cash payment equal to two times the executive\u2019s then-current annual base salary (or, if higher and as applicable, the annual base\nsalary as of immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event constituting good reason)\u037e\n\u2022\na lump sum cash payment equal to two times the executive\u2019s then-current annual target bonus amount\u037e\n\u2022\na lump sum cash payment for all of the executive\u2019s earned but unused vacation time\u037e and\n\u2022\n24 months\u2019 continuation of such benefits and employment privileges and/or perquisites as are afforded to other senior officers of Meridian.\nThe CIC agreements also provide that, upon any termination of employment following a change in control and during the term of the CIC agreement, each\nparticipating executive is entitled to such executive\u2019s annual bonus for the previously completed fiscal year to the extent unpaid.\nIn the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in the CIC agreements or otherwise payable to a participating executive would be subject\nto the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such severance and/or benefits will be either delivered in full or delivered to a\nlesser extent which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is more beneficial to the executive.\nFor quantification of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Meridian\u2019s applicable named executive\nofficers in the event of a qualifying termination immediately following the merger, see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Golden Parachute Compensation.\u201d\n3.\nMeridian Severance Practice\nMeridian does not have a formal severance policy, but in accordance with Meridian\u2019s past practice for executives at comparable levels, Meridian\nanticipates that Julie Smith would receive the following severance payments and\n66\nTable of Contents\nbenefits upon a qualifying termination, with the amounts of such benefits and the circumstances constituting a qualifying termination to be determined in\nthe discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of Meridian:\n\u2022\na lump sum cash payment equal to a portion of her then-current annual base salary plus a prorated portion of her then-current annual\ntarget bonus\u037e\n\u2022\noutplacement services for a certain period of time, likely not exceeding 12 months\u037e and\n\u2022\ncontinuation of certain health and welfare benefits for a certain period of time, likely not exceeding 12 months.\niii.\nMeridian Transaction Bonus Arrangements\nIn connection with the completion of the merger, Andrew Kitzmiller and Julie Smith will receive cash-based transaction bonuses payable at closing in\namounts equal to $150,000 and $50,000, respectively.\niv.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the surviving company in the merger will assume all specified rights to exculpation, indemnification and\nadvancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time, existing in favor of Meridian\u2019s directors and officers. For a\nperiod of six years after the effective time, Columbus Holding has agreed to, and has agreed to cause the articles of incorporation and code of regulations\nor similar organizational documents of the surviving company to contain provisions no less favorable to Meridian\u2019s directors and officers with respect to\nlimitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of the merger agreement in Meridian\u2019s constituent\ndocuments.\nColumbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub have agreed, and have agreed to cause the surviving company to indemnify and hold harmless each of\nMeridian\u2019s directors and officers with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses incurred in\nconnection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), for six years after the effective\ntime (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the\nrequest of or for the benefit of Meridian).\nFor a period of six years after the effective time, Columbus Holding, SDB and Merger Sub will cause to be maintained (or provide substitute policies) a six-\nyear \u201ctail policy\u201d with reputable insurers on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Meridian and its subsidiaries as of the date the merger agreement.\nSuch indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Directors\u2019\nand Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nv.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about\ncertain compensation for each of Meridian\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, which we refer to as \u201cmerger-\nbased compensation,\u201d and assumes, among other things, that each named executive officer incurs a qualifying termination of employment immediately\nfollowing completion of the merger.

Specifically, any Meridian shareholder who is a record holder of Meridian common stock on September 2, 2022, the\nrecord date for the special meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may be entitled to be paid the fair\ncash value of such shares after the completion of the merger in lieu of any applicable merger consideration.\nTo perfect dissenters\u2019 rights, a dissenting shareholder must satisfy each of the following conditions and otherwise comply with Section 1701.85 of the\nOGCL:\n\u2022\nMust be a shareholder of record. A dissenting shareholder must be a record holder of the shares as to which such shareholder seeks to\nexercise dissenters\u2019 rights on the record date.

Meridian may make a written request for evidence of authority if the\ndissenting demand is executed by a signatory who was designated and approved by the shareholder. The shareholder must provide the\nevidence within a reasonable time to Meridian but not sooner than 20 days after receipt of Meridian\u2019s written request.\n\u2022\nMust not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. A dissenting shareholder must not vote his, her or its shares in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting. Failing to vote does not waive a dissenting shareholder\u2019s dissenters\u2019 rights.\nHowever, a proxy submitted but not marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\nand will be deemed a waiver of dissenters\u2019 rights. A dissenting shareholder may revoke his, her or its proxy at any time before its exercise by\nfiling with Meridian an instrument revoking it, delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, voting by telephone or via the Internet\nat a later date than the date of the previous proxy or by attending and giving notice of the revocation of the proxy at the special meeting.\n\u2022\nMust file a written demand. A dissenting shareholder must deliver a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of such\nshareholder\u2019s shares to Meridian prior to the shareholder vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting (a \u201cwritten demand\u201d). Any\nwritten demand must specify the shareholder\u2019s name and address, the number and class of the shares held by the shareholder on the record\ndate, and the amount claimed by the shareholder as the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. Voting against the merger agreement is not\na written demand as required under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Because the written demand must be delivered to Meridian prior to the\nshareholder vote at the special meeting, it is recommended, although it is not required, that a shareholder use certified or registered mail,\nreturn receipt requested, to confirm that the shareholder has made a timely delivery.\n\u2022\nUpon request, must deliver certificates for placement of a legend. If Meridian sends a request to a dissenting shareholder at the address\nspecified in the written demand for the certificates representing the dissenting shares, the dissenting shareholder, within 15 days from the\ndate on which Meridian sends such request, must deliver to Meridian the certificates requested so that Meridian may endorse on them a\nlegend to the effect that demand for the fair cash value of such shares has been made. Such a request is not an admission by Meridian that\na dissenting shareholder is entitled to relief. Meridian will promptly return the endorsed share certificates to the dissenting shareholder. At\nthe option of Meridian,\n95Table of Contents\na dissenting shareholder who fails to deliver his, her or its share certificates upon request from Meridian may have his, her or its dissenters\u2019\nrights terminated upon de-livery by Meridian of written notice to such dissenting shareholder within 20 days after the lapse of the 15-day\nperiod, unless a court for good cause shown otherwise directs.\nMeridian and a dissenting shareholder may come to an agreement as to the fair cash value of the dissenting shares. If Meridian and the dissenting\nshareholder cannot agree upon the fair cash value of the dissenting shares, then either Meridian or the dissenting shareholder may, within three months\nafter service of the written demand by the dissenting shareholder, file a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio for a\ndetermination of whether the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any shares and, if so, the number and class of such\nshares. The complaint must contain a brief statement of the facts, including the vote and the facts entitling the dissenting shareholder to the relief\ndemanded. If the court finds the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair cash value of any dissenting shares, the court may appoint one or\nmore appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the amount of the fair cash value. The court will then make a finding as to the fair cash\nvalue of a share and will render judgment against Meridian for the payment of it. Interest on the fair cash value and the costs of the proceeding, including\nreasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, will be assessed as the court considers equitable.\nFair cash value for purposes of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL is the amount that a willing seller who is under no compulsion to sell would be willing to\naccept and that a willing buyer who is under no compulsion to purchase would be willing to pay, but in no event will the fair cash value exceed the\namount specified in the written demand of the dissenting shareholder. The fair cash value is to be determined as of the day prior to the vote of Meridian\u2019s\nshareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement. For shares listed on a national securities exchange (such as the NASDAQ, on which the Meridian\ncommon stock is currently listed), the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of the shares as of the close of trading on the day before the vote of\nMeridian\u2019s shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement. Investment banker opinions to company boards of directors regarding the fairness\nfrom a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction, such as the merger, are not opinions regarding, and do not address, fair cash\nvalue under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. Shareholders holding Meridian common stock considering seeking payment of the fair cash value of their\nshares should be aware that the fair cash value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or\nless than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their shares.\nUnless a dissenting shareholder\u2019s rights to receive the fair cash value of its shares is terminated, payment of the fair cash value must be made within 30\ndays after the later of the final determination of such value or the effective time of the merger. Such payment must be made only upon simultaneous\nsurrender to Meridian of the dissenting shareholder\u2019s share certificates for which such payment is made.\nA dissenting shareholder\u2019s rights to receive the fair cash value of his, her or its shares will automatically terminate if:\n\u2022\nThe dissenting shareholder has not complied with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, unless the Meridian Board waives such non-compliance\u037e\n\u2022\nThe merger is abandoned or is finally enjoined or prevented from being carried out, or Meridian shareholders rescind their adoption of the\nmerger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nThe dissenting shareholder withdraws his, her or its demand with the consent of the Meridian Board\u037e or\n\u2022\nThe dissenting shareholder and Meridian have not agreed on the fair cash value per share and neither has filed a timely complaint in the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio within three months after the dissenting shareholder delivered a written demand.\nAll rights accruing to holders of shares, including voting and dividend or distribution rights, are suspended from the time a dissenting shareholder\nsubmits a written demand with respect to any dissenting shares until the termination or satisfaction of the rights and obligations of the dissenting\nshareholder and Meridian arising from\n96\nTable of Contents\nthe written demand or the purchase of the shares by Meridian. During this period of suspension, any dividend or distribution paid on the dissenting\nshares will be paid to the record owner as a credit upon the fair cash value thereof. If dissenters\u2019 rights are terminated other than by purchase by Meridian\nof the dissenting shares, then at the time of termination all rights will be restored and all distributions that would have been made, but for suspension, will\nbe made.\nIf you wish to exercise your dissenters\u2019 rights, you should carefully review the text of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL set forth in Annex C to\nthis proxy statement and consider consulting your legal advisor.\nIf you fail to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, your dissenters\u2019 rights will be lost. To\nexercise such dissenters\u2019 rights with respect to your shares, you must:\n\u2022\nNOT vote your shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement (failing to vote does not waive a dissenting shareholder\u2019s\ndissenters\u2019 rights, however, a proxy submitted but not marked to specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement and will be deemed a waiver of dissenters\u2019 rights)\u037e\n\u2022\ndeliver to Meridian a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement at the special meeting, as described further below\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold your shares through the effective time of the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\notherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL.\nAll written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Meridian Corporation at 3471 River Hills Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio, 45244. Such demand must specify\nthe shareholder\u2019s name and address, that the shareholder intends thereby to demand dissenters\u2019 rights of such shareholder\u2019s shares, the number and\nclass of Meridian shares held by such shareholder on the record date and the amount claimed by such shareholder as the fair cash value of the\ndissenting shares. Voting against the merger agreement is not a written demand as required under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.\nIf a dissenting holder of Meridian common stock withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to\nthe OGCL, then the right of such shareholder to be paid the fair cash value of such Meridian common stock shall cease, and such holder\u2019s Meridian\ncommon stock shall be deemed to be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.\nThe foregoing description of the procedures to be followed in exercising dissenters\u2019 rights available to shareholders holding Meridian common stock\npursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL may not be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Sections 1701.84\nand 1701.85 of the OGCL, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that shareholders exercise their dissenters\u2019 rights under the OGCL.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL may result in the loss of a shareholder\u2019s\ndissenters\u2019 rights.\nIn view of the complexity of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, Meridian shareholders who may wish to pursue dissenters\u2019 rights should\nconsult their legal and financial advisors.\n97\nTable of Contents",

Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent or the Company will be required with respect to any matter set forth in this\nSection 5.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent would, upon the advice of outside legal counsel, violate\napplicable Antitrust Law.\nSection 5.2 No Solicitation by the Company.\n(a) From the Agreement Date until the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company will not, and the Company will cause\neach of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,\nknowingly encourage, knowingly induce, knowingly assist, or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the submission or announcement by any\nPerson of, any proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, the submission of any Takeover\nProposal (provided, however, that the\nAnnex A-33\nTable of Contents\nCompany, its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives may refer the Person making such proposal or offer to the provisions of this Section 5.2)\u037e (ii)\nfurnish any information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, or afford access to the Company\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019, books,\nrecords or property in connection with a Takeover Proposal\u037e (iii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or\nnegotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any\nTakeover Proposal (provided, however, that the Company and its Representatives may refer the Person making any such inquiry, proposal or offer to the\nprovisions of this Section 5.2)\u037e (iv) adopt, approve or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger\nagreement, purchase agreement, or similar document, agreement, or commitment with respect to any Takeover Proposal (a \u201cCompany Acquisition\nAgreement\u201d), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement\u037e or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing\nclauses (i) through (v) will not prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying or granting any waiver or release under any\nstandstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but solely to the extent necessary to allow for a Takeover\nProposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor\nand outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company\nBoard under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company receives a written bona fide written\nTakeover Proposal after the Agreement Date that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2(a), then the Company and its Representatives may make\ninquiries of such Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) solely to ascertain facts regarding, and clarify the terms of, such\nwritten Takeover Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Takeover Proposal and the Person making it.\n(b) Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.2, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their\nrespective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any\nPerson, conducted on or prior to the Agreement Date with respect to any Takeover Proposal.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, including Section 5.2(a), prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the\nCompany and its Representatives may following execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person(s), engage or otherwise\nparticipate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide any information to, any Person or group of Persons (or its or their Representatives and\nfinancing sources) that has made a bona fide written Takeover Proposal after the Agreement Date that did not result from a material breach of Section\n5.2(a) if prior to taking any such action, the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the\nfiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law and that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a\nSuperior Proposal. Substantially contemporaneously with providing any non-public information to such Person or group of Persons, the Company will\nmake such non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available to the Parent\nParties).\n(d) The Company will inform Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of receipt thereof) of its receipt of any written inquiry, proposal or offer\nwith respect to any Takeover Proposal received after the Agreement Date and any written request for non-public information in connection therewith\n(indicating the identity of the Person making the inquiry or proposal and the material terms of any such proposal, including providing copies of any\nCompany Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents) and thereafter will keep Parent reasonably informed of any material\ndevelopments regarding any Takeover Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material development). In the event that any\nPerson modifies its Takeover Proposal in any material respect (it being understood that any change in financial terms and any formal written modification\nshall be deemed material), the Company will notify Parent in writing within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such Takeover\nProposal has been modified and the terms\nAnnex A-34\nTable of Contents\nof such modification (including, if applicable, providing copies of written documentation reflecting such modification). The Company agrees that it and its\nSubsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date which prohibits the Company from\nproviding any information to Parent in accordance with Section 5.2(c) or this Section 5.2(d).\n(e) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.2(f) or Section 5.2(g), neither the Company Board nor any committee

modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (iii) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with\nany tender offer or exchange offer for the Shares other than a recommendation against such offer or a temporary \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication\nby the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Takeover Proposal, or fail to publicly\nreaffirm the Company Recommendation, in each case, within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (or such fewer number of days as\nremains prior to the Shareholders Meeting, but in no event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof be required to act on less than two\nBusiness Days\u2019 notice) following a publicly announced Takeover Proposal, provided that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any\nparticular Takeover Proposal or any material publicly announced or disclosed amendment or modification thereto, (v) adopt, approve or recommend to\nshareholders of the Company, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal, or (vi) resolve,\npublicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (the actions described in the foregoing clauses (e)(i) \u2013 (e)(vi) being referred to as a \u201cChange in\nRecommendation\u201d).\n(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 5.2(e), the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation\nand/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), if: (i) an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal (that did not result from a material\nbreach of Section 5.2(a)) is made and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor\nand outside legal counsel) that (x) a failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board\u2019s fiduciary duties\nunder applicable Law, and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) four Business Days have elapsed since the Company has\ngiven written notice to Parent identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal, advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change\nin Recommendation or terminate this Agreement and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of such\nSuperior Proposal and providing a copy of any written Company Acquisition Agreement and other definitive transaction agreements proposed to be\nentered into in connection therewith, including any definitive financing commitments relating thereto, (iv) during such four Business Day period the\nCompany has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable\nParent to propose in writing an offer binding on Parent to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal\nto no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (v) following the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and\nauthorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer from Parent, and has determined in good faith, after consultation with\nits financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such\nbinding offer were to be given effect\u037e provided, however, that if, during such four Business Day period, any material revisions are made to the Superior\nProposal (it being understood that a material revision will include any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal\nand any formal written modification to any other material term of such Superior Proposal), the Company Board will give a new written notice to Parent and\nwill comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(f) with respect to such new written notice (provided, that the notice period will be two Business\nDays instead of four Business Days), and (vi) prior to taking such action, at the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted\nand authorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer, and has determined in good faith, based on the information then\navailable and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such Change in Recommendation or terminate this\nAgreement due to the Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the\nAnnex A-35\nTable of Contents\nCompany Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The actions of the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof in\nmaking a determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company\u2019s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent\nrequired by this Section 5.2(f), will not in and of itself, constitute a Change in Recommendation, a violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of this\nAgreement.\n(g) Prior to the time the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation of the type described in Section\n5.2(e)(i) or Section 5.2(e)(ii) if: (i) the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after\nconsultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the\nCompany Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under applicable Law\u037e (ii) such action is not in response to the receipt, existence of or terms of a Takeover Proposal or\na Superior Proposal or any inquiry related thereto or the consequences thereof (which is governed by Section 5.2(f))\u037e (iii) such action is in response to a\nmaterial development, fact, change, event, effect, occurrence or circumstance that (A) is not known or reasonably foreseeable or, if known (or reasonably\nforeseeable), the consequences of which are not known or reasonably foreseeable, to the Company Board as of the Agreement Date and becomes known\nto the Company Board prior to the time of the Shareholder Approval, (B) does not result from any breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries, and (C) does not relate to the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal (an \u201cIntervening Event\u201d)\u037e and (iv) prior to taking such\naction, (w) the Company Board has given Parent at least four Business Days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to take such action absent any revision\nto the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice describes the Intervening Event (including the material facts and circumstances thereof) and\nthe reasons for such intended Change in Recommendation in reasonable detail, (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to\nnegotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to\npropose in writing an offer binding on the Parent Parties to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (y) at the end of such notice period, the\nCompany Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has considered in good faith any such binding offer, and has determined in\ngood faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such\nChange in Recommendation due to the Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board\u2019s fiduciary duties under\napplicable Law. The actions of the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof in making a determination that an\nIntervening Event necessitates a Change in Recommendation and the Company\u2019s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent required by this Section\n5.2(g), will not in and of itself, constitute a Change in Recommendation, a violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of this Agreement.\n(h) Notwithstanding any provisions thereof, nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or in Section 6.6 will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from\n(i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making\nany other disclosure to the Company\u2019s shareholders if, in the Company Board\u2019s determination in good faith after consultation with outside counsel, such\ndisclosure is required under applicable Law or (ii) issuing a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act\u037e\nprovided, however, that if any such disclosure pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation, it will be\ndeemed to be a Change in Recommendation.\n(i) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement is validly terminated, (x) this Agreement, the Merger and the principal terms\nthereof shall be submitted by the Company to the holders of Shares at the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval,\nand nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation and (y) the Company and the Company Board shall not submit\nto the holders of Shares any Takeover Proposal or propose to do so.\n(j) The Company agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such\nPerson\u2019s consideration of an acquisition of the Company or\nAnnex A-36\nTable of Contents\nany of its Subsidiaries return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its\nSubsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives and the Company will immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access for any\nsuch Person and any of its Representatives to diligence or other information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n(k) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of\nthis Section 5.2 by the Company.\nSection 5.3 DOJ Investigation. The Company shall (i) consult with Parent regarding proposals to, and material negotiations with, the DOJ regarding the\nDOJ Investigation and (ii) provide prompt notice to Parent of (A) any material development with the DOJ regarding the DOJ Investigation and (B) the\noccurrence of any Specified Outcome.\nARTICLE VI\nADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS\nSection 6.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement.\n(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary form of the Proxy\nStatement.

Except with respect to any disclosure or communication that relates to a Takeover\nProposal or a Change in Recommendation, the Company will provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and\nany amendment or supplement thereto or any substantive response to comments received from the SEC in respect thereof (including the proposed final\nversion of such document or response), in each case, prior to the mailing or submission thereof, and will give reasonable and good faith consideration to\nany comments thereon made by Parent or its counsel.\n(d) Until the Shareholder Approval is obtained, if any information relating to the Company, a Parent Party, SJL or any of their respective Affiliates,\ndirectors or officers, is discovered by the Company or a Parent Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so\nthat the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,\nin light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other Parties.\nThe Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent\nrequired by applicable federal securities Laws, disseminate such amendment to the holders of Shares as of the record date established for the\nShareholders Meeting.\nAnnex A-37\nTable of Contents\nSection 6.2 Shareholders Meeting.\n(a) Subject to Section 5.2, the Company will, in accordance with its constituent documents, the rules of Nasdaq, and applicable Law, duly set a record date\nand duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date the definitive Proxy Statement is disseminated to\nthe holders of Shares, a meeting of the holders of Shares for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval (including any adjournment or\npostponement thereof, the \u201cShareholders Meeting\u201d).
