However, the\nCompany was permitted to engage in negotiations during the Fiduciary Out Period (which period expired on\nApril 19, 2023) with a third party making an unsolicited, written bona fide acquisition proposal if such\nproposal was not the result of a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement\nand the Board or Special Committee determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors\nand outside legal counsel) that such proposal constituted, or could be reasonably expected to lead to, a\nSuperior Proposal (as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation\u201d) and the failure to engage\nin negotiations with such third party were reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s or Special\nCommittee\u2019s fiduciary duties, as applicable. No such proposals were received prior to the expiration of the\nFiduciary Out Period.\nIn addition, the Board generally is not permitted under the Merger Agreement to change its\nrecommendation in favor of the Merger Proposal. However, in certain circumstances, the Board is permitted\nto make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Diversey Board\nRecommendation\u201d) in response to certain unforeseen, intervening events or in response to an unsolicited\nwritten bona fide acquisition proposal that the Board or Special Committee determines in good faith\nconstitutes a Superior Proposal if, in either case, the Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so\nwould be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, has negotiated in good faith with\nParent for a period of five business days to make adjustments to the Merger Agreement so as to obviate the\nneed to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and, following the five-business-day period, the Board\nor the Special Committee, as applicable, has determined that the failure of the Board or the Special\nCommittee, as applicable to change its recommendation would be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s or the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s fiduciary duties, as applicable.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement (Page 97)\nThe Company (provided that such termination by the Company has been approved by the Special\nCommittee) and Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the\nEffective Time of the Merger. In addition, either Parent or the Company (provided that such termination by\nthe Company has been approved by the Special Committee) may terminate the Merger Agreement at any time\nbefore the Effective Time if:\nany permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or\nother legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing consummation of the Merger is in\n9 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neffect, or any action has been taken by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that, in\neach case, prohibits, makes illegal or otherwise restrains or enjoins the consummation of the Merger\nand has become final and non-appealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate the Merger\nAgreement has used its reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent pursuant to, resolve\nor lift, as applicable, such injunction, action, statute, rule, regulation or order\u037e\nif the Merger has not been consummated by the Termination Date, provided that if all of the\nconditions to the Closing, other than the Requisite Shareholder Approval Condition, the Regulatory\nCondition and the Legal Restraint Condition (as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\u200bConditions\nto the Merger) (to the extent that the Legal Restraint Condition is in respect of a consent,\nauthorization or approval required under the Regulatory Condition), shall have been satisfied (or in\nthe case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing,\nshall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date) or waived, then\nthe Termination Date shall be automatically extended to March 8, 2024, and such date shall thereafter\nbe deemed to be the Termination Date), provided that a party may not seek to terminate the Merger\nAgreement if such party\u2019s action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a breach\nof the Merger Agreement by such party) has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, either\n(A) the failure to satisfy the conditions to such party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger or (B)\nthe Termination Date occurring before the Effective Time\u037e or\nif the Company fails to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Special Meeting\u037e provided\nthat a party may not seek to terminate the Merger Agreement if such party\u2019s action or failure to act\n(which action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the Merger Agreement by such party) has been\nthe cause of, or resulted in, the failure to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval.\nIn addition, Parent and the Company have the right in certain circumstances to unilaterally terminate the\nMerger Agreement, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement.\u201d\nTermination Fees and Expenses (Page 98)\nThe Company has agreed to pay Parent $92,000,000 in cash upon the termination of the Merger\nAgreement under certain circumstances. Parent has agreed to pay the Company $125,000,000 in cash upon\nthe termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances.\nExcept as expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection\nwith the Merger Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,\nwhether or not the Merger is consummated.\nDissenting Shareholder Rights Under the Companies Act (2023) Revision of the Cayman Islands (Page 111)\nUnder Cayman Islands law, if the Merger is completed, shareholders who provide written objection to\nthe Merger before the vote at the Special Meeting to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger\nand the Transactions and who thereafter perfect and do not withdraw their dissent will have the right to be\npaid the fair value of their shares of the Company, as ultimately determined by the Grand Court of the\nCayman Islands, provided that they comply with all requirements of Section 238 of the CICA. Dissenters\u2019\nrights are available only to registered holders of Ordinary Shares. Section 238 of the CICA is attached as\nAnnex H to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully and in its entirety.\nLitigation Related to the Merger (Page 64)\nBetween April 20, 2023 and May 4, 2023, the Company received four demand letters (the \u201cDemand\nLetters\u201d), each from a purported shareholder of the Company alleging to have identified materially misleading\nand incomplete statements in the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on April 11, 2023.\nOne of the Demand Letters from a purported Company shareholder includes a draft complaint, which\nnames the Company and its directors as defendants. The draft complaint alleges, among other things, that\nthe defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially false and misleading preliminary proxy statement with\nthe SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and\n10 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The potential plaintiff seeks as relief, among other things, injunctive\nrelief preventing defendants from filing a definitive proxy statement and from consummating the Merger\nunless additional disclosures are made, rescission of the Merger in the event the Merger is consummated or\nawarding of rescissory damages and an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019\nand experts\u2019 fees and expenses.\nThe Company believes the claims asserted in the draft complaint and the Demand Letters are without\nmerit. Additional demand letters or lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be received and/or filed in the\nfuture.\n11 \n",

These questions and answers\nmay not address all questions that may be important to you as a holder of Ordinary Shares. For important\nadditional information, please refer to the more detailed discussion contained elsewhere or incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in\nthis proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving these proxy materials?\nYou are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card in connection with the solicitation of proxies by\nthe Board because you were a shareholder of Diversey as of May 11, 2023, the record date for the\nSpecial Meeting which is being held in connection with the proposed Merger. To complete the Merger,\nthe affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present\nand voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required. A copy of the\nMerger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, and a copy of the Plan of Merger is\nattached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The Merger Agreement calls for the Plan of Merger and\nother documents required under the CICA to effect the Merger to be filed with the Registrar of\nCompanies of the Cayman Islands as provided by Section 233 of the CICA. The Company will submit\nthe Merger Proposal to its shareholders for approval at the Special Meeting described in this proxy\nstatement. For more information, please read the section entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u201d beginning on\npage 67 of this proxy statement. You are also being asked to vote to approve the advisory and non-\nbinding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.\nThis proxy statement and the related Schedule 13E-3, each of which you should read carefully, contain\nimportant information about the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Special\nMeeting and the matters to be voted on thereat. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to\nvote your Ordinary Shares without attending the Special Meeting and to ensure that your Ordinary\nShares are represented and voted at the Special Meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are encouraged to\nsubmit a proxy as soon as possible.\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders and the other\nconditions to Closing under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, subject to the terms\nand conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, will be\nmerged with and into the Company. The Company will be the Surviving Company in the Merger and will\ncontinue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.\nWhat will happen to the Company generally as a result of the Merger?\nIf the Merger is completed, the Company will cease to be an independent public company and will be\nwholly owned by Parent. As a result, you will no longer have any ownership interest in the Company.\nUpon Closing, Ordinary Shares will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system,\nincluding Nasdaq. In addition, following the Closing, the registration of Ordinary Shares and the\nCompany\u2019s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, will be terminated.\nWhat will happen to Ordinary Shares as a result of the Merger?\nIf the Merger is completed, each Ordinary Share (other than the Excluded Shares and the Bain Shares)\nthat you hold immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and exchanged into the right to\nreceive $8.40 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Bain Shares\nwill be cancelled and exchanged into the right to receive $7.84 in cash, without interest and subject to\nany applicable withholding taxes. The Rollover Shares will be exchanged by the Bain Shareholder\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the Merger for common and preferred units of Topco (or, in\ncertain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in\n12 TABLE OF CONTENTS\naccordance with the terms of the Rollover Agreement (such Rollover Shares being valued at an amount\nequal to $7.84 per Ordinary Share). This does not apply to Ordinary Shares held by any shareholders\nwho are entitled to and who have properly demanded and perfected their dissention rights in\naccordance with Section 238 of the CICA as more fully described in the section entitled \u201cDissenting\nShareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023 Revision) of the Cayman Islands\u201d beginning on\npage 111 of this proxy statement.\nOrdinary Shares subject to Diversey equity awards will be cancelled at the effective time of the Merger\nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nOrdinary Shares subject to Diversey equity awards will be cancelled at the effective time of the Merger\nin exchange for, (i) in the case of stock options, no consideration, (ii) in the case of restricted stock and\ncertain restricted stock units, the right to receive the merger consideration of $8.40 in cash per each\nOrdinary Share subject to such Diversey equity award without interest and subject to any applicable\nwithholding taxes, or (iii) in the case of certain other restricted stock units, cash-settled awards subject\nto certain service-based vesting conditions following the effective time of the Merger. The treatment of\nDiversey equity awards is more fully described in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Treatment of\nOrdinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards\u201d beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement.\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nWe currently expect the Merger to be completed in the second half of 2023. However, the Merger is\nsubject to various closing conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals, and it is possible\nthat the failure to timely meet these Closing conditions or other factors outside of the Company\u2019s\ncontrol could delay the Closing. The Company cannot assure you that it will complete the Merger on\nthis schedule or at all.\nWhen and where will the Special Meeting be held?\nThe Special Meeting will be held on June 8, 2023 starting at 10:00 a.m., ET, at the Company\u2019s offices at\n1300 Altura Road, Suite 125, Fort Mill, South Carolina 29708.\nWhat are the proposals that will be voted on at the Special Meeting?\nYou will be asked to consider and vote upon (1) the Merger Proposal and (2) the advisory and non-\nbinding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nThe Board, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously\ndetermined that the Transactions are in the best interests of the Company. Thus, the Board, based in\npart on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously recommends that you\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal. For more information, read the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-\u200b\nRecommendation of the Diversey Board of Directors and Special Committee\u201d beginning on page 27 of\nthis proxy statement. The Board also unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory and\nnon-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed for any reason?\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, shareholders will not receive any payment for their\nOrdinary Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a stand-alone public\ncompany, and Ordinary Shares will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under specified\ncircumstances, the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, as described under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.\nWhat will happen if shareholders do not approve the Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation\nProposal?\nThe approval of the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation\nProposal is not a condition to the Closing. The vote on this proposal by ordinary resolution is an\nadvisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. If the Merger Proposal is approved by\nthe shareholders and completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company\u2019s\n13 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnamed executive officers even if shareholders do not approve the advisory and non-binding Named\nExecutive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.\nWho is entitled to attend and vote at the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for the Special Meeting is May 11, 2023. If you are the record owner of Ordinary Shares\nas of the close of business on the record date, you are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special\nMeeting. As of the record date, there were 324,579,219 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding held\ncollectively by approximately 27 shareholders of record. If your Ordinary Shares are held through a\nbrokerage firm, bank or other nominee, you must obtain and present a proxy from your brokerage firm,\nbank or other nominee in order to attend and vote your Ordinary Shares in person at the Special\nMeeting.\nWhat is the vote required to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions?\nUnder Cayman Islands law, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by the holders of\nOrdinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is\nrequired to authorize the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Transactions.\nAre there any shareholders who have already committed to vote in favor of the Merger?\nYes, the Bain Shareholder, the Company\u2019s controlling shareholder and an entity advised by Bain Capital\nPrivate Equity, LP, which held approximately 73.0% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares as of May 11,\n2023, executed the Voting Agreement with the Company and Parent, pursuant to which the Bain\nShareholder agreed, among other things and subject to certain limitations, to vote all Ordinary Shares\nowned or acquired by it prior to the record date in favor of the Merger Proposal. If the Bain Shareholder\nvotes in compliance with its obligations under the Voting Agreement, the Requisite Shareholder\nApproval is assured. See \u201cSpecial Factors-Voting Agreement,\u201d on page 62 for additional information.\nHow are votes counted?\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed by the Company for the Special Meeting.\nFor each of the Special Meeting proposals, you may vote \u201cFOR\u201d, \u201cAGAINST\u201d or \u201cABSTAIN\u201d.\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes\ncast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at\nthe Special Meeting. The approval of the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-\nRelated Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least a simple majority of the votes\ncast by the holders of Ordinary Shares present and voting in person or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Special Meeting. If you (i) attend the Special Meeting in person or by proxy and abstain\nfrom voting, the effect will be, among other things, that your shares will count towards quorum at the Special\nMeeting, but will not count as a vote cast at the Special Meeting or (ii)(a) fail to submit a proxy over the Internet,\nby telephone, by mail or otherwise fail to attend the Special Meeting and cast your vote in person or (b) fail to give\nvoting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, your shares will not count towards quorum at\nthe Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the Special Meeting\nproposals.\nWhat is a quorum?\nA quorum will be present if holders of a simple majority of the Ordinary Shares outstanding and entitled\nto vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Given that the Bain\nShareholder owns greater than 50% of the Ordinary Shares, the general meeting will be quorate unless\nthe Bain Shareholder or its successors and assigns or affiliates are not in attendance.\nIf you mark, validly sign, date and return a proxy card (or otherwise properly submit a proxy over the\nInternet or by telephone) but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals\nlisted on the proxy card, your Ordinary Shares will be counted for purpose of determining whether a\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting.\nIf your Ordinary Shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and you do not obtain\na proxy from your broker or other nominee and attend the Special Meeting in person, or do not\n14 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninstruct the nominee how to vote your Ordinary Shares, these Ordinary Shares will not be voted at the\nSpecial Meeting, nor will they be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for\nthe transaction of business at the Special Meeting.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the\nannexes and the other documents referred to in this proxy statement, please vote your Ordinary Shares\nas described below. You have one vote for each Ordinary Share you own as of the record date.\nHow do I vote if I am a shareholder of record?\nYou may:\nsubmit a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number printed on your proxy card and\nfollowing the telephone voting instructions printed\u037e\nsubmit a proxy over the Internet at the URL listed on your proxy card and following the Internet\nvoting instructions\u037e\nsubmit a proxy by marking, validly signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and each additional\nproxy card you receive from the Company and returning each proxy card in its accompanying\npostage-paid envelope\u037e or\nvote your Ordinary Shares by appearing and casting your vote in person at the Special Meeting.\nIf you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be\nreceived by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.\nSubmitting a proxy by telephone over the Internet, or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person\nat the Special Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail\neven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your Ordinary Shares are\nrepresented at the Special Meeting.\nIf you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to\nhave your Ordinary Shares voted, your Ordinary Shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.\nWith respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Special Meeting, Ordinary Shares\nrepresented by proxies received by the Company will be voted with respect to such matter in\naccordance with the judgment of the persons named in the proxies.\nHow do I vote if my Ordinary Shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank or other nominee?\nIf your Ordinary Shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust,\nthen the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record with\nrespect to those Ordinary Shares. However, you still are considered to be the beneficial owner of those\nOrdinary Shares, with your Ordinary Shares being held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d \u201cStreet name\u201d holders cannot\nvote their Ordinary Shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee\nhow to vote their Ordinary Shares. Your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to\nvote your Ordinary Shares for you at the Special Meeting if you instruct it how to vote. If you wish to\nvote your Ordinary Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d in person at the Special Meeting, you must obtain and\npresent a valid proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee authorizing you to vote such\nOrdinary Shares at the Special Meeting. Failure to obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or\nother nominee authorizing you to vote at the Special Meeting and to instruct your brokerage firm, bank\nor other nominee how to vote your Ordinary Shares will cause your shares to not count towards quorum\nat the Special Meeting, and if a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the\nSpecial Meeting proposals.\nIn addition, because any Ordinary Shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a\ndifferent shareholder than any Ordinary Shares you hold of record, Ordinary Shares held by such\nnominee will not be combined for voting purposes with Ordinary Shares you hold of record. To be\n15 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsure your Ordinary Shares are represented and voted at the Special Meeting, you should instruct your\nbrokerage firm, bank or other nominee on how to vote your Ordinary Shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy?\nIf you receive more than one proxy, it means that you hold Ordinary Shares that are registered in more\nthan one account. For example, if you own your Ordinary Shares in various registered forms, such as\njointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will\nneed to mark, validly sign, date and return, a separate proxy card for those Ordinary Shares because\nthey are held in a different form of record ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your Ordinary\nShares are voted, you will need to mark, validly sign, date and return each proxy card you receive or\nsubmit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet for each proxy card you receive by using the different\ncontrol number(s) on each proxy card.\nMay I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have delivered my proxy?\nYes. If you are a shareholder of record of Ordinary Shares, you have the right to change or revoke your\nproxy before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting:\nby delivering to the Company\u2019s Secretary a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later\nthan the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked\u037e\nby attending the Special Meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by\nitself, revoke your proxy\u037e you must also vote in person at the Special Meeting)\u037e\nby signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same Ordinary Shares and bearing a later date\u037e\nor\nby submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.\nWritten notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of any proxies\nshould be addressed to:\nDiversey Holdings, Ltd. \n1300 Altura Road, Suite 125 \nFort Mill, South Carolina, 29708 \nAttention: Secretary\nIf you hold your Ordinary Shares through a brokerage firm, a bank or other nominee, you should contact\nyour brokerage firm, bank or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to change or revoke your\nvoting instructions.\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me?\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your Ordinary\nShares. If you are a U.S. Holder, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain\nrecognized in connection with the Merger. The tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on\nyour particular circumstances, including but not limited to the application of federal non-income, state,\nlocal and non-U.S. tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will\naffect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see \u201cSpecial Factors-\nCertain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 58 of this\nproxy statement.\nAm I entitled to dissenter rights?\nUnder Cayman Islands law, if the Merger is completed, shareholders who provide written objection to\nthe Merger before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting to authorize the Merger Agreement, the\nPlan of Merger and the Transactions and who thereafter perfect and do not withdraw their dissent will\nhave the right to be paid the fair value of their shares as ultimately determined by the Grand Court of the\nCayman Islands, provided that they comply with all of the requirements of CICA as\n16 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cDissenting Shareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023\nRevision) of the Cayman Islands\u201d beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement. This fair value amount\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the per share Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary\nShare payable to the Company\u2019s shareholders (other than the Bain Shareholder) pursuant to the terms\nof the Merger Agreement. Dissenters\u2019 rights are available only to registered holders of shares. A copy\nof the full text of Section 238 is attached as Annex H to this proxy statement.\nThese procedures are complex and you should consult your Cayman Islands legal counsel if you are\nconsidering exercising such rights. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy the procedural requirements\nof the CICA, you will lose your right to dissent.\nWhat happens if I sell my Ordinary Shares before the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the\nSpecial Meeting and the expected Closing Date of the Merger. If you transfer your Ordinary Shares after\nthe record date but before the Special Meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain\nyour right to vote at the Special Meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration\nor Bain Consideration, as applicable, to the person to whom you transferred your Ordinary Shares.\nIn addition, if you sell your Ordinary Shares prior to the Special Meeting or prior to the Effective Time,\nyou will not be eligible to exercise dissenter rights with respect to those Ordinary Shares in respect of\nthe Merger. For a more detailed discussion of dissenter rights and the requirements for perfecting your\ndissenter rights, see \u201cDissenting Shareholder Rights under the Companies Act (2023 Revision) of the\nCayman Islands\u201d beginning on page 111 and Annex H of this proxy statement.\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or\nmore shareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the applicable\nshareholder provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.\nIn such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the Special Meeting and proxy\ncard. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Ordinary\nShares held through such firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Ordinary Shares, you may\nhave already received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly\nif you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange\nfor delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You\nmay decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nSPECIAL FACTORS\nBackground of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the\nMerger Agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the\nBoard, the Special Committee, the representatives of the Company or the Special Committee, or other\nparties, including Platinum and the Bain Shareholder.\nAs a matter of course and in their ongoing focus on enhancing shareholder value, the Board and the\nCompany\u2019s management, at times with the assistance of outside advisors, have regularly reviewed and\nevaluated the Company\u2019s business plan and strategy, taking into account the changing developments,\ntrends, risks and conditions affecting the business and its industry generally. The Board and Company\nmanagement conduct such review in coordination with the Bain Shareholder, the majority owner of the\nCompany\u2019s outstanding Ordinary Shares since its IPO in 2021, and its affiliates. The Bain Shareholder\ncurrently owns approximately 73.0% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. Since the Company\u2019s initial public\noffering (the \u201cIPO\u201d), the Bain Shareholder and its affiliates have also continually reviewed, considered and\nevaluated the Bain Shareholder\u2019s ongoing investment in the Company, how to maximize its value and\npotential options with respect thereto.\nOn July 6, 2021, Platinum announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Solenis.\nFollowing this acquisition, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder had several informal\ndiscussions about the possible strategic benefits of a potential business combination between the Company\nand Solenis. None of these conversations involved specific discussions of potential transaction terms or\ntransaction structure and no proposals were made by either party.\nOn February 15, 2022, Ken Hanau, a member of the Board nominated by the Bain Shareholder, and John\nPanichella, CEO of Solenis, had lunch. During the course of that meeting Mr. Panichella gave an overview of\nSolenis to Mr. Hanau, and they discussed a potential combination of Solenis and the Company. Prior to this\nmeeting, Mr. Panichella sent materials introducing Solenis to Mr. Hanau and the potential benefits of a\nstrategic transaction involving Solenis and the Company. These materials were discussed in greater detail\nduring the course of the February 15 meeting. No specific terms of a potential transaction were discussed in\nconnection with this meeting and no proposals were made by either party.\nOn March 24, 2022, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder met via telephone to discuss\nthe feasibility of a potential transaction involving the Company. No specific terms of such a potential\ntransaction were discussed and no proposals were made by either party.\nOn June 29, 2022, representatives of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder met over dinner to further\ndiscuss the feasibility of a potential transaction involving the Company. Although specific economic terms\nwere not discussed, possible transaction structures were discussed in general terms. No proposals were\nmade by either party.\nOn August 3, 2022, the Company received a letter from Platinum and Solenis (the \u201cAugust 3 Letter\u201d)\nsetting forth, on a non-binding basis, Platinum\u2019s and Solenis\u2019 interest in pursuing a take-private acquisition\nof the Company and a subsequent combination of the Company with Solenis at a price of $11.00 per Ordinary\nShare, in cash, subject to a number of terms and conditions. The August 3 Letter contemplated that one or\nmore of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders would invest in the transaction.\nOn August 8, 2022, the Board met via videoconference to consider the August 3 Letter and authorized\nthe management of the Company to explore with Platinum and Solenis the potential synergies that could\nresult from an acquisition of the Company by Platinum and Solenis in order to facilitate an evaluation of a\npotential transaction by Platinum and the Bain Shareholder. The Board also authorized the management of\nthe Company to provide Platinum and Solenis with certain due diligence information regarding the Company,\nas requested by Platinum and Solenis. The Board discussed that it would form a special committee to\nevaluate the transaction at an appropriate time, if the potential transaction involved a rollover of a portion of\nthe Bain Shareholder\u2019s investment in the Company such that the Bain Shareholder would continue to be a\nshareholder of the combined entity. Representatives of the Bain Shareholder indicated to the Board that they\nwere evaluating their interest in the potential investment contemplated by Platinum\u2019s and\n18 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSolenis\u2019 letter, understanding that such investment by the Bain Shareholder might be necessary to facilitate\nthe financing of the potential transaction. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell\nLipton\u201d) also participated in the meeting at the invitation of Eric Foss, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board,\nwith the expectation that in the event that a special committee were to be formed, Wachtell Lipton could be\nengaged as such committee\u2019s legal advisor. Representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cK&E\u201d) also\nparticipated in the meeting, as counsel to the Company and the Bain Shareholder. Representatives of\nWachtell Lipton and K&E discussed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties and obligations in connection with a\npotential sale of the Company and discussed certain potential conflicts of interest that could arise in\nconnection with the exploration of a potential sale. On August 12, 2022, the Company entered into a non-\ndisclosure agreement with Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (an affiliate of Platinum), Solenis and Bain Capital\nPrivate Equity, L.P.\nThroughout August and September of 2022, the Company, the Bain Shareholder, Platinum and Solenis\ncontinued to discuss a potential transaction, and Platinum and Solenis conducted due diligence on the\nCompany, including, among other things, access to a virtual dataroom. To assist with these activities, the\nCompany informally engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d) as financial advisor to the\nCompany in connection with the potential transaction, with the understanding that a formal engagement\nletter would be negotiated and executed in the future. J.P. Morgan was selected to act as financial advisor to\nthe Company due to its familiarity with the Company (including acting as a lead underwriter on the\nCompany\u2019s IPO), and its experience, expertise and qualifications in advising companies on M&A\ntransactions. The Bain Shareholder and Platinum also jointly engaged FTI Consulting, Inc., (\u201cFTI\u201d) to\nprepare a report on potential synergies that could result from the proposed combination of the Company and\nSolenis.\nOn September 15 and 16, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder, Solenis, J.P. Morgan\nand the Company participated in a series of management presentations and Q&A sessions at the Bain\nShareholder\u2019s offices in New York, including reviews of the Company\u2019s 3-year business plan and FTI\u2019s initial\nassessment of the potential synergies resulting from the proposed combination of the Company and Solenis,\nall as part of the ongoing due diligence process.\nOn September 26, 2022, representatives of Platinum informed representatives of the Board that, in light\nof financing and other market conditions, as well as the Company\u2019s earnings results and downward pressure\non its trading price, Platinum and Solenis would be unable to proceed with the transaction on the terms\ncontemplated by the August 3 Letter. All parties agreed that FTI should nevertheless continue in its next\nphase of diligence and prepare a more detailed assessment of potential synergies of the proposed\ntransaction.\nOn October 5, 2022, the Board and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and K&E met via videoconference\nand the Board authorized the Company to allow Platinum and Solenis to continue conducting due diligence\nand approved site visits by FTI. Over the next several weeks, FTI conducted site visits, met with\nmanagement teams of both companies and prepared its report with respect to these potential synergies.\nOn November 21, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder, Solenis and the Company met\nvia videoconference to review FTI\u2019s more detailed report on potential synergies resulting from the proposed\ncombination of the Company and Solenis. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed and no\nproposals were made by either party.\nOn December 7, 2022, representatives of Platinum, the Bain Shareholder and Solenis met to discuss\nupdates on Solenis and the Company. Platinum expressed a desire to restart discussions regarding a\npotential transaction and subsequent combination of Solenis and the Company. Representatives from the\nvarious parties corresponded over the subsequent two weeks regarding potential financing structures given\ncapital market dislocation, including the amount and structure of a potential rollover of a portion of the\nOrdinary Shares held by the Bain Shareholder into the combined company in order to facilitate a transaction.\nRepresentatives of the Bain Shareholder indicated that they would consider such potential rollover\ninvestment if it was useful to facilitate a potential transaction and discussed that it may be beneficial to\nenhance cash consideration to the Unaffiliated Shareholders.\nDuring December, representatives of the Bain Shareholder and Platinum had several discussions to\nexplore and negotiate the terms of a potential rollover of a portion of the Bain Shareholder\u2019s investment into\nthe combined company so that Platinum could secure financing for a revised proposal.\n19 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 14, 2022, representatives of the Bain Shareholder met with the Board and informed the\nBoard that they expected Platinum to restart discussions with respect to a potential transaction and that a\nrevised offer from Platinum to the Board might be received shortly.\nOn December 23, 2022, representatives of Platinum informed representatives of the Bain Shareholder\nthat they were working towards presenting a proposal to the Company for $7.50 per Ordinary Share in cash.\nOn January 11, 2023, the Company received an updated proposal from Platinum and Solenis (the\n\u201cJanuary 11 Letter\u201d) setting forth, on a non-binding basis, Platinum\u2019s and Solenis\u2019 interest in pursuing a\nrevised take-private acquisition of the Company and subsequent combination of the Company and Solenis at\na price of $7.50 per Ordinary Share, in cash. The January 11 Letter contemplated that the Bain Shareholder\nwould rollover a portion of the Ordinary Shares owned by it into the combined entity, and indicated that the\nBain Shareholder would be expected to execute a voting agreement in connection with the proposed\ntransaction.\nOn January 14, 2023, the Board, with certain members of management in attendance, held a meeting via\nvideoconference to discuss the January 11 Letter and to consider the formation of a Special Committee\nconsisting of directors of the Company who are not directly or indirectly affiliated with, and who are\notherwise independent from, the Bain Shareholder and Platinum and who are not members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement to evaluate the January 11 Letter, consider the Transactions and provide a recommendation to\nthe Board. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton, which would be retained by the Special Committee as its\ncounsel upon its formation, and K&E were present and discussed certain legal matters with the Board,\nincluding fiduciary duty and process considerations. Following that presentation, the Board approved the\nformation of the Special Committee, consisting of Messrs. Selim Bassoul, Juan R. Figuereo, Eric Foss (as\nChairman), Rodney Hochman and Ms. Katherine S. Zanotti, each of whom the Board determined were not\nmembers of Company management and were unaffiliated, directly or indirectly, and were otherwise\nindependent from, the Bain Shareholder and from Platinum. The Board delegated to the Special Committee\nfull power and authority to:\nreview and to evaluate the terms and conditions, and to determine the advisability of, the\nTransactions\u037e\nnegotiate with Platinum, Solenis and the Bain Shareholder (or any other party the Special Committee\ndeemed appropriate) with respect to the terms and conditions of the Transactions and, if the Special\nCommittee deemed appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve and\nrecommend the execution and delivery of agreements in connection with the Transactions on behalf\nof the Company\u037e\ndetermine whether the Transactions negotiated by the Special Committee are fair to, and in the best\ninterests of, the Company and its shareholders, including the Unaffiliated Shareholders, with the\ninstruction that the Special Committee would have no duty to consider the interests of the Bain\nShareholder as the controlling shareholder of the Company\u037e\nsolicit the views of the Company\u2019s executive, financial, and other officers regarding the terms and\nconditions of the Transactions and on any reports, studies or similar information pertaining to the\nTransactions provided to the Special Committee by advisors or agents retained by the Special\nCommittee\u037e and\nrecommend to the full Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Board with respect to the\nTransactions (including recommending not to pursue the Transactions) and confirmed that the Board\nwould not approve the Transactions without a prior favorable recommendation of the Special\nCommittee.\nThe Board also authorized the Special Committee to retain, at the Company\u2019s expense, the Special\nCommittee\u2019s own legal and financial advisors to assist the Special Committee. The Special Committee\nconfirmed its retention of Wachtell Lipton as its legal advisor and agreed to hold an initial meeting in the\ncoming days to discuss additional next steps.\nOn January 16, 2023, the Company shared a draft version of its \u201c5 Year Plan\u201d with the Bain Shareholder\nas part of the Company\u2019s typical planning and budgeting process. The 5 Year Plan included prospective\nfinancial information for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 through the fiscal year ending December\n31,\n20 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n2027, and is the basis of the Management Projections (as defined in the section entitled \u201cManagement\nProjections\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement). The draft 5 Year Plan was also shared with J.P.\nMorgan later that week, and continued to be updated by the Company over the next several days.\nOn January 17, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting via videoconference with representatives of\nWachtell Lipton in attendance to discuss general transaction process considerations and next steps,\nincluding selection of a financial advisor. The representatives of Wachtell Lipton also discussed certain legal\nmatters with the Special Committee at this meeting, including with respect to the fiduciary duties of directors\nunder the circumstances regarding the Transactions. Also during this meeting, the Special Committee\ndiscussed with Wachtell Lipton potential financial advisors the Special Committee could consider retaining\nin connection with the Transactions, and requested that Wachtell Lipton request certain information from,\nand set up interviews with, certain potential financial advisors.\nOn January 21, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting via videoconference with representatives of\nWachtell Lipton and certain members of Company management in attendance to interview several financial\nadvisors, including Evercore, and reviewed information regarding each such financial advisor\u2019s expertise,\nexperience, qualifications, and any existing or prior relationships with the Company, Platinum, Solenis or the\nBain Shareholder. In connection with its review, the Special Committee and Wachtell Lipton discussed and\nreviewed Evercore\u2019s relationship disclosure letter made available to the Special Committee prior to the\nmeeting. The Special Committee and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed certain of Evercore\u2019s prior\nrelationships with Bain Capital Private Equity L.P. and Platinum that had been disclosed, as further described\nin the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial\nAdvisor.\u201d The Special Committee reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of the disclosed\nrelationships would impact Evercore\u2019s ability to act in an independent and disinterested manner in rendering\ntheir services to the Special Committee in connection with the potential transaction. Considering this, among\nother factors, the Special Committee selected Evercore as its financial advisor, began to review the terms of\nEvercore\u2019s engagement with the assistance of Wachtell Lipton and instructed representatives of Evercore to\nbegin engaging with the management of the Company with respect to its information review and financial\nanalysis process. The Special Committee and Wachtell Lipton proceeded to negotiate the terms of the\nEvercore engagement with representatives of Evercore over the next ten days.\nOn January 22, 2023, at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore delivered\nEvercore\u2019s initial information review request list to the management of the Company. Company management\nand representatives of Evercore also engaged in a videoconference to coordinate Evercore\u2019s information\nreview process. From this time through the execution of the Merger Agreement, in response to requests from\nrepresentatives of Evercore on behalf of the Special Committee, the Company provided representatives of\nEvercore with updated information on an iterative basis as requested by representatives of Evercore.\nOn January 24, 2023, the Company provided the Management Projections to the Special Committee and\nthe Special Committee directed Evercore to use such information in connection with performing certain of its\nfinancial analyses in connection with its opinion. The Management Projections were also posted to the\nvirtual dataroom for review by Platinum and Solenis.\nOn January 25, 2023, the Company informally engaged Centerview Partners LLC (\u201cCenterview\u201d) as an\nadditional financial advisor to the Company in connection with the proposed Transactions, with the\nunderstanding that a formal engagement letter would be negotiated and executed in the future. Centerview\nwas selected to act as financial advisor to the Company due to its experience, expertise and qualifications in\nadvising companies on M&A transactions. At this time, Centerview received and began reviewing\ninformation regarding the Company and the proposed transaction, including the Management Projections.\nOn January 26, 2023 and January 29, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and\nWachtell Lipton and certain members of Company management met via videoconference to discuss\ninformation reviewed and financial analysis conducted to date.\nOn January 31, 2023, Evercore, the Special Committee, and the Company executed a letter agreement\nwith Evercore finalizing the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement.\nOn February 1, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference, during which meeting the representatives\n21 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Evercore presented Evercore\u2019s preliminary financial analysis. Following discussion with the\nrepresentatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton, the Special Committee determined to make a\ncounterproposal to Platinum\u2019s and Solenis\u2019 initial proposal at a price to be finalized, but at least $10.00 per\nOrdinary Share held by the Unaffiliated Shareholders, with such counterproposal assuming that the\ndefinitive agreements providing for the Transactions would include (i) a non-waivable condition that a\nmajority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares owned by holders other than the Bain Shareholder vote their\nOrdinary Shares in favor of the Transactions (a \u201cMajority of the Minority Approval Condition\u201d) and (ii) the\nability of holders of the Ordinary Shares other than the Bain Shareholder to, at such holders\u2019 election, (a)\nreceive cash consideration or (b) contribute Ordinary Shares to the surviving entity on the same terms as the\nBain Shareholder (a \u201cPublic Rollover Option\u201d).\nOn February 2, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the proposed counterproposal and\nfinalize the price to be included therein. After discussion, the Special Committee instructed representatives\nof Evercore to communicate a counterproposal (including both the Majority of the Minority Approval\nCondition and the Public Rollover Option) at a price of at least $10.20 per Ordinary Share, as well as its\nrationale for the counterproposal, to Platinum and instructed representatives of Wachtell Lipton to\ncommunicate the same information to the Bain Shareholder. The Special Committee instructed its advisors to\nindicate, in conveying the counterproposal, that the Special Committee was only concerned with the price\napplicable to the Unaffiliated Shareholders.\nLater on February 2, 2023, representatives of Evercore met via telephone with representatives of\nPlatinum and presented the Special Committee\u2019s initial counterproposal of at least $10.20 per Ordinary Share\nheld by the minority shareholders (as compared to $7.50 per Ordinary Share held by all shareholders\nproposed by Platinum and Solenis in the January 11 Letter), as well as the Special Committee\u2019s request for\nthe Majority of the Minority Approval Condition and the Public Rollover Option. At the direction of the\nSpecial Committee, representatives of Evercore stated during the call that the Special Committee had\nconsidered the following factors, among others, in formulating its counterproposal: (i) higher transaction\nmultiples in the hygiene/cleaning sectors than represented by Platinum\u2019s and Solenis\u2019 offer of $7.50 per\nOrdinary Share\u037e (ii) the potential easing of both challenging market headwinds and raw material cost\nincreases currently affecting the Company\u2019s financial performance\u037e and (iii) trading multiples for peer\ncompanies were at relatively low levels compared with historical averages.\nAdditionally, on February 2, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton communicated the Special\nCommittee\u2019s counterproposal to the Bain Shareholder. In this and subsequent discussions, representatives\nof the Bain Shareholder indicated (i) the Bain Shareholder\u2019s view that $10.20 per Ordinary Share\ncounterproposal was significantly higher than any price Platinum would be willing to pay to all of the\nholders of Ordinary Shares and (ii) that the Bain Shareholder did not believe it was appropriate to agree to a\ntransaction that included either (a) differential cash consideration between the Bain Shareholder and the\nother shareholders or (b) a Majority of the Minority Approval Condition. The Bain Shareholder also\nindicated that it did not believe Platinum would agree to a Majority of the Minority Approval Condition.\nOn February 6 and February 7, 2023, Company management hosted a management due diligence session\nin person at the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (\u201cGibson Dunn\u201d), Platinum\u2019s and Solenis\u2019 counsel,\nin New York and via videoconference for Platinum that was also attended by representatives of Solenis, the\nBain Shareholder, the Company, Wachtell Lipton, J.P. Morgan, Centerview and Evercore. In response to\nquestions posed by representatives of Platinum and Solenis, Company management provided information\nregarding Company strategy, prospects, operations, financial performance, liquidity, capital resources and\nsimilar matters, including the Management Projections.\nOn February 7, 2023, Platinum delivered a counterproposal to representatives of Evercore of $7.75 per\nOrdinary Share, an increase of $0.25 per Ordinary Share from its previous proposal of $7.50, noting that such\ncounterproposal did not include the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition or the Public Rollover\nOption and that neither the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition nor the Public Rollover Option were\nacceptable to them. Platinum further noted that the $7.75 per Ordinary Share price applied to both the\nOrdinary Shares held by the Bain Shareholder and the Ordinary Shares held by any other shareholders, and\nthat the negotiation of any deviation from this construct (i.e., differential cash consideration between\n22 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Bain Shareholder and any other shareholders) should be between representatives of the Bain\nShareholder and the Special Committee, not involving Platinum.\nOn February 9, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference to discuss Platinum\u2019s counterproposal of $7.75\nper Ordinary Share and the terms thereof. The Special Committee discussed with representatives of Evercore\nand Wachtell Lipton and determined, following further discussions, to reject Platinum\u2019s proposal of $7.75 per\nOrdinary Share and hold firm on the Special Committee\u2019s prior counterproposal of at least $10.20 per\nOrdinary Share in cash for the minority shareholders, including the Public Rollover Option and Majority of\nthe Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore and\nWachtell Lipton to communicate the position of the Special Committee to Platinum and to the Bain\nShareholder and subsequently report back to the Committee. On February 10, 2023, representatives of\nEvercore relayed the terms of the Special Committee\u2019s counterproposal to representatives of Platinum and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton relayed the terms of the Special Committee\u2019s counterproposal to\nrepresentatives of Bain.\nOn February 12, 2023, the Special Committee and representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton met\nwith representatives of the Bain Shareholder via videoconference. The Bain Shareholder\u2019s representatives\ndiscussed with the Special Committee the actions taken and numerous concessions agreed to by the Bain\nShareholder in order to facilitate the Transactions, based on requests by Platinum given market conditions,\nincluding (1) the acceptance by the Bain Shareholder of a rollover into common and preferred equity\nsecurities in lieu of cash for a portion of its Ordinary Shares in order to both increase the amount of cash\nconsideration available to the minority shareholders, and ensure that minority shareholders would be able to\nreceive cash for all of their Ordinary Shares, and that the Bain Shareholder\u2019s Ordinary Shares would be\nvalued below what the Bain Shareholder considered to be fair market value for the benefit of Platinum\u037e (2) the\nacceptance by the Bain Shareholder of certain terms proposed by Platinum related to such rollover and its\ncontinued ownership of equity interests in the combined company after the consummation of the\nTransactions, including limited minority rights\u037e (3) an agreement to waive contractual rights under the\nCompany\u2019s Tax Receivable Agreement (such rights estimated by the Bain Shareholder as having a value of\napproximately $76.7 million as of December 31, 2022) that the Bain Shareholder would otherwise have been\nentitled to in connection with the Transactions and (4) an agreement by the Bain Shareholder to enter into a\ntax indemnity agreement, pursuant to which the Bain Shareholder could be required to indemnify Platinum\nand its related parties against certain potential tax-related liabilities and losses in an amount of up to\n\u20ac200,000,000. The Bain Shareholder\u2019s representatives reiterated to the Special Committee that the Bain\nShareholder did not consider it appropriate to accept differential cash consideration between the Bain\nShareholder and the other shareholders, in part because of the Bain Shareholder\u2019s view that such differential\nconsideration was not common market practice and in light of the other concessions it believed it was\nalready making to facilitate the Transactions.\nAfter discussion following the departure of the Bain Shareholder\u2019s representatives from the meeting,\nthe Special Committee determined to continue negotiating for a transaction with one or more of the following\nthree characteristics for the benefit of the Unaffiliated Shareholders: (i) a Public Rollover Option\u037e (ii) cash\nconsideration for the Unaffiliated Shareholders significantly higher than Platinum\u2019s current proposal (which,\nbased on Platinum\u2019s feedback to date, likely would require the Bain Shareholder to accept cash consideration\nat a lower price per Ordinary Share than the Unaffiliated Shareholders)\u037e and/or (iii) a Majority of the Minority\nApproval Condition. The Special Committee then instructed representatives of Evercore to prepare a list of\nprecedent transactions wherein minority public shareholders were offered differential cash consideration\nfrom the majority shareholder for the Special Committee\u2019s review, which representatives of Evercore provided\nthe following day.\nOn February 13, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and\ncertain members of Company management met at Wachtell Lipton\u2019s offices (with some participants joining\nvia videoconference) to discuss the actions taken and concessions made by the Bain Shareholder to\nfacilitate the Transactions and discuss expectations around an expected counterproposal from Platinum.\nOn February 14, 2023, Platinum delivered a counterproposal to representatives of Evercore of $7.90 per\nOrdinary Share, noting that such counterproposal did not include the Majority of the Minority Approval\nCondition or the Public Rollover Option.\n23 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 14, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and\ncertain members of Company management met at Wachtell Lipton\u2019s offices (with some participants joining\nvia videoconference) to discuss the updated counterproposal from Platinum of $7.90 per Ordinary Share and\nthe terms thereof. Following discussion, the Special Committee agreed to meet again the following day to\nfurther consider this counterproposal and various potential responses thereto before determining next steps.\nAlso on February 14, 2023, representatives of Gibson Dunn delivered an initial draft of the Merger\nAgreement and the Voting Agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton and K&E. The draft Merger\nAgreement contemplated, among other things, a Company termination fee of 4.5% of the equity value implied\nby the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent termination fee of 4.0% of the\nequity value implied by the per share price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction and no Majority of the\nMinority Approval Condition.\nOn February 15, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and\ncertain members of Company management held a follow-up meeting at Wachtell Lipton\u2019s offices (with some\nparticipants joining via videoconference) to further discuss the proposed counteroffer to Platinum and the\nBain Shareholder. After discussion, the Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore and\nWachtell Lipton to communicate the counterproposal to Platinum and the Bain Shareholder of, at the Bain\nShareholder and Platinum\u2019s election, (i) $8.00 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders with the\nMajority of the Minority Approval Condition or (ii) $9.00 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders\nwithout the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee determined not to include\nthe Public Rollover Option in the terms of its counterproposal considering, among other factors, Platinum\u2019s\nposition that the Public Rollover Option would create significant execution complexity and that Platinum\nwould in any event be unwilling to permit Solenis to become a publicly traded company in the current market\nenvironment. Also at this meeting, representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee potential\ndeal structures where the minority shareholders would receive differential consideration from the Bain\nShareholder, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed their preliminary perspectives on the draft\nMerger Agreement and Voting Agreement received from Gibson Dunn.\nOn February 15, 2023, pursuant to the Special Committee\u2019s instructions, representatives of Evercore\ndelivered the counterproposal discussed at the February 15, 2023 Special Committee meeting to\nrepresentatives of each of Platinum and the Bain Shareholder.\nOn February 18, 2023, Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson\nDunn.

The draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among\nother things, a Company termination fee of 3% of the equity value implied by the per share price for the\nOrdinary Shares in the transaction and a Parent termination fee of 7% of the equity value implied by the per\nshare price for the Ordinary Shares in the transaction, reinstatement of the Special Committee\nRecommendation Condition, that the parties would not be obligated to consummate the Merger prior to the\ndate that is 4.5 months after execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement to afford Platinum time to\nobtain its debt financing and removal of the Specific Performance Termination Right.\nOn March 1, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the updated counterproposal from\nPlatinum of $7.95 per Ordinary Share and the terms thereof and the status of the draft transaction\nagreements. After discussion, the Special Committee determined to have a follow-up meeting the next day to\nfurther discuss next steps.\nOn March 2, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton met with representatives of Gibson Dunn via\ntelephone to discuss certain terms in the Merger Agreement. Significant terms discussed and negotiated at\nsuch meeting included, among other matters, the duration and terms of the Company\u2019s \u201cfiduciary out\u201d\nperiod, the efforts that would be required of the parties to obtain certain regulatory approvals, the length of\ntime Platinum would be afforded to obtain its debt financing under certain circumstances set forth in the\nMerger Agreement, the quantum of the termination fee payable by the Company to Parent and the reverse\ntermination fee payable by Parent to the Company (in the circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement),\nthe nature of each party\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and the Majority of the Minority\nApproval Condition.

The representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Evercore updated the Special\nCommittee on recent discussions with representatives of Platinum and Solenis and the Bain Shareholder.\nAfter discussion, the Special Committee determined that if the cash consideration offered by Platinum\nincreased sufficiently, or if the Bain Shareholder accepted differential cash consideration from the other\nshareholders, the Transactions would not need to include the Majority of the Minority Approval Condition.\nThe Special Committee instructed representatives of Evercore to reject Platinum\u2019s latest proposal and\ncounter with a proposal of $8.90 for the minority shareholders per Ordinary Share, without the Majority of\nthe Minority Approval Condition. The Special Committee also instructed representatives of Evercore to\nencourage Platinum to engage with the Bain Shareholder to find ways those two parties could modify the\ntransaction structure, including potentially differential cash consideration between Ordinary Shares held by\nthe Bain Shareholder versus the other shareholders, to accommodate the delivery of a higher price to such\nother shareholders. Representatives of Evercore delivered this message to Platinum later that day.\nOn March 3, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference, wherein representatives of Evercore confirmed\nto the Special Committee that they had communicated the Special Committee\u2019s counterproposal to Platinum.\nThe Special Committee determined to wait for a response from Platinum to the Special Committee\u2019s\ncounterproposal prior to taking any further action.\nLater on March 3, 2023, representatives of Platinum delivered a revised counterproposal to\nrepresentatives of Evercore of $8.00 per Ordinary Share to shareholders of the Company on a combined\nbasis, consisting of differential consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share to the minority shareholders, and\nlower consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share to the Bain Shareholder, and also communicated the\ncounterproposal to representatives of the Bain Shareholder. Also on March 3, 2023, the Chairman of the\n25 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSpecial Committee spoke via telephone with a representative of the Bain Shareholder, who indicated that in\norder to facilitate the deal and in addition to the other concessions previously accepted, the Bain\nShareholder was prepared to accept the proposed differential consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share, such\nthat the minority shareholders would receive $8.40 per Ordinary Share. The Chairman of the Special\nCommittee subsequently updated the other members of the Special Committee, as well as representatives of\nEvercore and Wachtell Lipton, on this revised proposal.\nOn March 4, 2023, the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and Wachtell Lipton and certain\nmembers of Company management met via videoconference to discuss the updated counterproposal from\nPlatinum and concession by the Bain Shareholder to accept a lower price per share than the other\nshareholders. After discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined to provisionally accept\nPlatinum\u2019s counteroffer for $8.40 per Ordinary Share for the minority shareholders, subject to finalization of\ntransaction documents, the receipt of Evercore\u2019s fairness opinion and final approval. The Committee\ninstructed representatives of Evercore to finalize its financial analysis of the $8.40 per Ordinary Share for the\nminority shareholders proposal and instructed Wachtell Lipton to continue to negotiate and finalize the\nMerger Agreement and other transaction documents with Gibson Dunn and K&E.

Representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special\nCommittee Evercore\u2019s financial analysis of the consideration proposed in the Transactions to be paid to the\nUnaffiliated Shareholders. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of the draft transaction\nagreements. Representatives of Evercore then rendered Evercore\u2019s oral opinion, which was subsequently\nconfirmed in writing, to the Special Committee to the effect that, as of the date of and subject to the\nassumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions set forth in such opinion, the Merger\nConsideration, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ordinary Shares (other than holders of\nBain Shares or Excluded Shares).

At a meeting of the Special Committee held on March 7, 2023, Evercore rendered to the Special\nCommittee its opinion to the effect that, as of March 7, 2023 and based upon and subject to the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore\u2019s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $8.40\nper share to be received by the holders of Ordinary Shares in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders (other than holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares).\nThe full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the\nprocedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review\nundertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex G to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by\nreference. The Company encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore\u2019s opinion was\naddressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in\nconnection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special\nCommittee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of Ordinary Shares should\nvote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared\nto other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying\nbusiness decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that\nEvercore deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates\u037e\nreviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to\nEvercore by management of the Company, as approved for its use by the Special Committee (the\n\u201cManagement Projections\u201d, as defined and more fully described in the section entitled \u201cSpecial\nFactors-Management Projections\u201d beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement)\u037e\ndiscussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of\nthe Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the Management\nProjections (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Management\nProjections)\u037e\nreviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Ordinary Shares\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those\nof certain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the\nMerger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that\nEvercore deemed relevant\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated March 7, 2023, of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nand\nperformed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore\ndeemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or\notherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification\nof such information (and Evercore did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent verification\nof such information), and further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they\nwere not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading.\n34 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nWith respect to the Management Projections, Evercore assumed with the Special Committee\u2019s consent that\nthey had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith\njudgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. Evercore\nexpressed no view as to the Management Projections or the assumptions on which they were based.\nFor purposes of Evercore\u2019s analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its\nanalysis, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft Merger Agreement\nreviewed by Evercore, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger\nAgreement were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements\nrequired to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of\nthe Merger would be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed, in all\nrespects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases\nnecessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or\ncondition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce\nthe contemplated benefits to the holders of the Ordinary Shares (other than the Bain Shares or Excluded\nShares) of the Merger.\nEvercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and did\nnot make or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the\nCompany, nor was Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the\nsolvency or fair value of the Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or\nsimilar matters. Evercore\u2019s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the\ndate of Evercore\u2019s opinion and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could\nbe evaluated on the date of the opinion. It was understood that subsequent developments may affect\nEvercore\u2019s opinion and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nEvercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than\nthe fairness to the holders of the Ordinary Shares (other than the holders of Bain Shares or Excluded Shares),\nfrom a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. Evercore did not express any view on, and\nEvercore\u2019s opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any consideration\nreceived in connection therewith by, the holders of Bain Shares or any other class of securities, creditors or\nother constituencies of the Company, nor the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement nor any allocation among shareholders of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, including among all holders of Ordinary Shares, nor as to the fairness of the amount or\nnature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the\nCompany, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Evercore\nwas not asked to, nor did Evercore express any view on, and Evercore\u2019s opinion did not address, any other\nterm or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of\nthe Merger, any offer to purchase, redeem or exchange, or consent solicitation undertaken with respect to,\noutstanding debt securities of the Company, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger\nAgreement including the Rollover Agreement or the TRA Termination Agreement. Evercore\u2019s opinion did not\naddress the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be\navailable to the Company, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in\nthe Merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from\nany third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the Ordinary Shares or any business\ncombination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company. Evercore\u2019s opinion did not constitute\na recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to\nhow any holder of Ordinary Shares should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore did not express any\nopinion as to the prices at which the Ordinary Shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of\nvolatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the\nMerger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations\nwhen they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and assumed the accuracy\nand completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory,\naccounting and tax matters.\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSet forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special\nCommittee on March 7, 2023 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does\nnot purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses\ndescribed and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these\nanalyses by Evercore. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it\nis based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or before March 6, 2023 (the last full trading\ndate prior to the rendering of Evercore\u2019s opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions.\nFor purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and\nfinancial conditions, industry sector performance and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated\nas of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates contained\nin Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or\nreview, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews. In addition,\nanalyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be\nappraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold.\nAccordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses and reviews are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe following summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables\nare not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses.\nConsidering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses,\nincluding the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof such analyses.\nSummary of Evercore\u2019s Financial Analyses\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nEvercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present\nvalue of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows, defined as net operating profit after tax, plus\ndepreciation and amortization, less changes in net working capital and capital expenditures, less other adhoc\noperating costs, plus other operating cash flow items, less M&A acquisition cash outflows, less cash\noutflows relating to the Tax Receivable Agreement, that the Company was forecasted to generate during the\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Management Projections. Evercore calculated\nterminal values for the Company utilizing terminal multiple and perpetuity growth rate methodologies.\nTerminal Multiple Methodology\nEvercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying terminal multiples of 10.0x to 12.0x,\nwhich range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to the Company\u2019s\nestimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) in fiscal year 2027 based\non the Management Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to\npresent value as of January 1, 2023 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on\nan estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting\nconvention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January\n1, 2023, and the number of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.95 to $9.68,\ncompared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share. For purposes of Evercore\u2019s analysis,\n\u201cCompany Net Debt\u201d was calculated as (1) total debt of the Company, plus (2) tax-effected pension liability,\nplus (3) asset retirement obligations, less (4) cash and cash equivalents.\nPerpetuity Growth Rate Methodology\nEvercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying perpetuity growth rates of 3.25% to\n3.75%, which range was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal\n36 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nyear estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate based\non the Management Projections. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to\npresent value as of January 1, 2023 using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0%, which were based on\nan estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting\nconvention. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January\n1, 2023, and the number of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $5.72 to $9.03,\ncompared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nSelected Public Company Trading Analysis\nEvercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding\nfinancial multiples and ratios for the following selected publicly traded companies of similar size as the\nCompany in the chemicals and services industry (the \u201cSelected Companies\u201d):\nAshland Global Specialty Chemicals Inc.\nAvient Corporation\nAxalta Coating Systems Ltd.\nChampionX Corporation\nH.B. Fuller Company\nIngevity Corporation\nInnospec Inc.\nISS A/S\nQuaker Chemical Corporation\nSensient Technologies Corporation\nStepan Corporation\nFor each of the Selected Companies, Evercore calculated total enterprise value (defined as equity market\ncapitalization plus total debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as\na multiple of estimated EBITDA for the 2023 fiscal year, which is referred to as \u201c2023E EBITDA\u201d, based on\nclosing share prices as of March 3, 2023. Estimated financial data of the selected companies were based on\npublicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\nSelected Company\nTEV / 2023E EBITDA\nAshland Global Specialty Chemicals Inc.\n10.5x\nAvient Corporation\n11.9x\nAxalta Coating Systems Ltd.\n11.3x\nChampionX Corporation\n9.4x\nH.B.

Based on this range of implied\nenterprise values, the Company\u2019s estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the number of fully\ndiluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s management, this analysis indicated a\nrange of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.25 to $7.95, compared to the Merger Consideration of\n$8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nAlthough none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected\nthese companies because they are publicly traded chemical and service companies that Evercore, in its\nprofessional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of its\nfinancial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with\nregard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other\nmatters, as well as differences in the selected companies\u2019 financial, business and operating characteristics.\nAccordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis\ninvolves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values\nof the selected companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical analysis,\nsuch as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the\nselected companies.\nEvercore also reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding\nfinancial multiples and ratios for Ecolab Inc. (\u201cEcolab\u201d), which Evercore considered to be a comparable\ncompany based on its professional judgment and experience. Estimated financial data of Ecolab was based\non publicly available research analysts\u2019 estimates. Evercore calculated the average discount since the time of\nthe Company\u2019s initial public offering of the Company\u2019s total enterprise value as a multiple of its next twelve\nmonth EBITDA (\u201cNTM EBITDA\u201d) to Ecolab\u2019s total enterprise value as a multiple of its NTM EBITDA.\nEvercore subtracted the average discount of 7.8x that it calculated from a range of Ecolab\u2019s total enterprise\nvalue / NTM EBITDA multiples of 18.4x-20.0x based on Ecolab\u2019s NTM EBITDA as of March 3, 2023 and\nEcolab\u2019s NTM EBITDA at the time of the Company\u2019s initial public offering, respectively, to derive a range of\ntotal enterprise value / NTM EBITDA multiples for the Company of 10.6x-12.2x and applied this range of\nmultiples to the Company\u2019s 2023E EBITDA based on the Management Projections. Based on this range of\nimplied enterprise values, the Company\u2019s estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the number\nof fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s management, this analysis\nindicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.37 to $8.18, compared to the Merger\nConsideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nEvercore reviewed financial information related to the following selected transactions involving target\ncompanies in the hygiene and cleaning chemicals industry announced since 2011 and selected the ones for\nwhich financial information was publicly available (the \u201cSelected Transactions\u201d).\nFor each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied total enterprise value (defined as the\ntarget company\u2019s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus\ntotal debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of last\ntwelve-month EBITDA for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cLTM EBITDA\u201d. Estimated financial data of the Selected Transactions were based on\npublicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction.\n38 \n(1) \n(2) \n* \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe analysis for the Selected Transactions reviewed by Evercore (as well as the month and year each\nwas announced), was as follows:\nMonth and Year \nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nTEV \n($mm)\nEBITDA \n($mm)\nTEV / LTM \nEBITDA\nJune 2011\nSealed Air\nCorporation\nDiversey Holdings, Inc.\n$4,355\n$ 449\n9.7x\nApril 2015\nNew Mountain\nCapital, L.L.C.\nZep Inc.\n$ 692\n$ 59\n11.8x\nMarch 2017\nBain Capital, LLC\nSealed Air Corporation-Diversey\nCare Division\n$3,200\n$ 251\n12.7x\nOctober 2017\nDiversey Holdings, \nInc.\nZenith Hygiene Group plc\n$ 131\n$\n9\n14.0x\nApril 2020\nEQT\nSch\u00fclke & Mayr GmbH\n$1,088\n$ 82\n13.3x\nMay 2020\nKersia Group\nHolchem Group Limited\n$ 107\n*\n*\nOctober 2020\nIK Investment\nPartners\nKersia Group\n*\n*\n*\nNovember 2020\nKersia Group\nSopura S.A.\n*\n*\n*\nFebruary 2021\nBain Capital\nPrivate Equity\nCinven\nLonza Group AG-Specialty\nIngredients business\n$4,672\n$ 358\n13.0x\nAugust 2021\nLanxess AG\nInternational Flavors & \nFragrances Inc.

Based on\nthis range of implied enterprise values, the estimated Company Net Debt as of January 1, 2023, and the\nnumber of fully diluted Ordinary Shares, in each case as provided by the Company\u2019s management, this\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $6.56 to $8.59, compared to the\nMerger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nAlthough none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the Selected Transactions analysis is\ndirectly comparable to the Company and none of the Selected Transactions is directly comparable to the\nMerger, Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or businesses that Evercore,\nin its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of\nits financial analyses. In evaluating the Selected Transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions\nwith regard to general business, economic and market conditions and other factors existing at the time of the\nSelected Transactions, and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions.\nAccordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis\ninvolves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values\nof the target companies or businesses in the Selected Transactions and the multiples derived from the\nSelected Transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a\nmeaningful method of using the data of the Selected Transactions.\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Factors\nEvercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses\nwith respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other\nthings, the following:\nLast 52-Week Trading Range\nEvercore reviewed historical trading prices of Ordinary Shares during the twelve month period ended\nMarch 6, 2023, noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $3.95 to $10.68 per\nOrdinary Share, respectively.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nEvercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the Ordinary Shares prepared and\npublished by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of March 3, 2023. These price targets\nreflect analysts\u2019 estimates of the future public market trading price of the Ordinary Shares at the time the\nprice target was published. As of March 3, 2023, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets\nper Ordinary Share was $5.00 to $9.00, with a median price target of $6 per share. No new price targets were\npublished on March 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the\nSpecial Committee. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not\nnecessarily reflect current market trading prices for the Ordinary Shares and these target prices and the\nanalysts\u2019 earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including\nfactors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future general industry and market\nconditions.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price\nEvercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per Ordinary\nShare, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a\ncompany\u2019s equity as a function of that company\u2019s NTM EBITDA, and an assumed enterprise value to NTM\nEBITDA multiple.\nIn calculating the implied present value of the future price per Ordinary Share, Evercore first calculated\nthe implied future enterprise value of the Company by multiplying the Company\u2019s estimated NTM EBITDA\nfor the 2026 fiscal year, based on the Management Projections, by an illustrative enterprise value to NTM\nEBITDA multiple range of 8.8x to 10.8x, which was selected based on Evercore\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, to derive an implied future enterprise value reference range for the Company as of December 31,\n2025. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, and the Company Net Debt as of December 31, 2025,\nas based on the Management Projections, Evercore calculated a reference range of implied future equity\nvalues for the Company. Evercore then discounted the implied future equity values to back to January 1,\n2023 using a discount rate of 12.2%, which was based on an estimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity. This\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $5.93 to $8.09, compared to the\nMerger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore\nreviewed 26 transactions and announced bids for control of U.S. public targets in the chemicals and materials\nindustry announced over the last 15 years. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the\npremiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each\nsuch transaction exceeded the closing market prices per share of the target companies one day prior to the\nannouncement of each transaction and the volume weighted average price per share of the target companies\nover a period of thirty days (\u201c1M VWAP\u201d) prior to announcement of each transaction.\nThis analysis indicated the following:\n1 Day \nClosing\nPrice\n1M \nVWAP\n25th Percentile\n19\n16\nMedian\n28\n31\n75th Percentile\n41\n49\n40 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a\npremium range of 28% to 41% to the closing price per Ordinary Share of $6.14 as of March 6, 2023 and\npremium range of 31% to 49% to the 1M VWAP per Ordinary Share of $5.89 as of March 6, 2023. This\nanalysis indicated a range of implied equity values per Ordinary Share of $7.86 to $8.66 and $7.71 to $8.77,\nrespectively, compared to the Merger Consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share.\nPreliminary Presentations\nIn addition to the presentation made to the Special Committee on March 7, 2023, the date on which\nEvercore delivered its opinion, as described above, Evercore made other presentations to the Special\nCommittee on January 26, February 1, February 9, February 13, February 14, February 15, February 16,\nFebruary 17, February 21, February 22, February 23, February 24, February 27, February 28, March 1, March\n2, March 3, March 4, and March 7, 2023, which are referred to as the preliminary Evercore presentations.\nCopies of the preliminary Evercore presentations provided to the Special Committee by Evercore have been\nattached as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3. These written presentations and the written opinion will be\navailable for any interested holder of Ordinary Shares to inspect and copy at the Company\u2019s executive\noffices during regular business hours.

Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses may have\ndiffered due to changes in those conditions and other information, and not all of the written and oral\npresentations contained all of the financial analyses included in the March 7, 2023 presentation.\nMiscellaneous\nThe foregoing summary of Evercore\u2019s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description\nof the analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the\nMerger by the Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of\nthe summary described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view\nof the processes underlying Evercore\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered\nthe results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one\nanalysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all the\nanalyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other\nanalyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of\nanalyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of\nthe Ordinary Shares. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the\nfigures shown.\nEvercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as\nto the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Ordinary Shares\n(other than holders of Bain Shares or the Excluded Shares). These analyses do not purport to be appraisals\nor to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates\ncontained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly\nmore or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the\nresults derived from, Evercore\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore\nassumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such estimates.\nEvercore\u2019s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of\nthe Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The\nissuance of Evercore\u2019s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.\nEvercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee, the Board\nor the Company\u2019s management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration in the Merger for the holders of Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to the terms of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has\nagreed to pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $8.5 million, of which $500,000\nwas paid as a retainer fee upon execution of Evercore\u2019s engagement letter with the Company, $2,000,000 was\npaid upon delivery of Evercore\u2019s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the\nconsummation of the Merger.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company were represented by the Special Committee, which\nnegotiated the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their behalf, with the assistance of the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors.\nReasons of the Bain Shareholder for the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, the Bain Shareholder is an affiliate of the\nCompany for purposes of the Merger, and, therefore, required to express its purposes and reasons for the\nMerger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company. The Bain Shareholder is making the statements in\nthis section solely for the purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under\nthe Exchange Act. The views of the Bain Shareholder do not make any recommendations as to how\nshareholders of the Company should vote their Ordinary Shares relating to the Merger.\nWhen approached by Platinum about the Company pursuing a potential sale of the Company, the Bain\nShareholder considered favorable current market conditions, and concluded that facilitating a take-private\ntransaction that would provide certain value to all of the Company\u2019s shareholders, as well as a premium of\napproximately 41.0% over the Company\u2019s closing share price on March 7, 2023, the last full trading day prior\nto the announcement of the proposed Transactions, could be attractive to the Unaffiliated Shareholders. The\nBain Shareholder ultimately agreed, in order to facilitate the proposed Transactions, to accept a lower price\nfor its Ordinary Shares, forfeit its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, enter into the Tax Indemnity\nAgreement, sell only a portion of the Bain Shares and to rollover the remaining portion of the Bain Shares.\nThe Bain Shareholder believes that it is in the best interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders to effect a\nliquidity transaction that affords the opportunity to receive the applicable merger consideration and related\ncertainty of value, particularly when compared to the Company's stand-alone business plan and long-term\nprospects, and the associated benefits and risks.\nIf the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the\nOrdinary Shares will cease to be publicly traded. For the Bain Shareholder, the purpose of the Merger is to\neffectuate the Transactions and the Rollover Agreement, which will allow the Bain Shareholder to realize the\nvalue of a portion of its Ordinary Shares by receiving $7.84 per Ordinary Share in cash for a portion of its\ninvestment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder will also own common and preferred units of Topco (or, in\ninvestment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder will also own common and preferred units of Topco (or, in\ncertain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a subsidiary of Topco) in exchange\nfor the remaining portion of its investment in the Company. The Bain Shareholder believes that structuring\nthe transaction in such manner is preferable to other alternative transaction structures because (i) it will\nenable Parent to acquire all of the outstanding Shares of the Company at the same time and (ii) it represents\nan opportunity for the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Shareholders to immediately realize the value of its\ninvestment in the Company at a price of $8.40 per Ordinary Share in cash, without interest and subject to\napplicable withholding taxes, and for the Bain Shareholder to immediately realize the value of a significant\nportion of their investment in the Company at a price of $7.84 per Ordinary Share in cash, without interest\nand subject to applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set\nforth in the Merger Agreement. The Bain Shareholder did not consider any other alternative transaction\nstructures or other alternative means to accomplish the purposes set forth above because no other\nalternatives would enable them to achieve the same objectives.\nPosition of the Bain Shareholder as to the Fairness of the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, the Bain Shareholder is an affiliate of the\nCompany for purposes of the Merger and, therefore, required to express its beliefs as to the fairness of the\nproposed going private transaction and the Merger to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company. The\nMerger is the Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13E-3 Transaction Statement has been filed with\nthe SEC. As described below, the Bain Shareholder believes that the going private transaction and the\nMerger is fair to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Shareholders on the basis of the factors described under\n\u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons of the Company for the Merger\u201d and \u201cSpecial Factors-Position of the Parent\nEntities as to the Fairness of the Merger.\u201d Directors of the Company employed by the Bain Shareholder did\nnot participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee regarding the going private transaction and the\nMerger, and did not receive advice from the legal or other advisors of the Special Committee as to the\nfairness\n44 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the going private transaction and the Merger. As disclosed under \u201cSpecial Factors-Interests of the\nCompany\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d the Bain Shareholder has interests in the going\nprivate transaction and the Merger both different from those of the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the\nCompany by virtue of the Bain Shareholder\u2019s right to receive cash consideration of $7.84 per Ordinary Share,\nwithout interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (whereas the Unaffiliated Shareholders have\nthe right to receive cash consideration of $8.40 per Ordinary Share, without interest and subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes) and the requirement of the Bain Shareholder to rollover a portion of its\nownership stake in the Company (such rollover being valued with the same per Ordinary Share valuation of\nthe Ordinary Shares used to determine the Bain Consideration) in exchange for an ownership stake in Topco\n(and, in certain circumstances, a subsidiary of Topco), which will indirectly own the Company following the\nconsummation of the going private transaction and the Merger, and similar to those of the Unaffiliated\nShareholders by virtue of the fact that the Bain Shareholder is eligible to receive cash consideration for a\nportion of its Ordinary Shares upon completion of the going private transaction and the Merger, albeit at a\nlower price per Ordinary Share than will be received by the Unaffiliated Shareholders.\nThe Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company were represented by the Special Committee, which\nnegotiated the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their behalf, with the assistance of the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors. The Merger Agreement is recommended by the\nSpecial Committee and approved by the Board. Based on the knowledge and analysis of the Bain\nShareholder of available information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with the Company\u2019s\nmanagement regarding the Company and its business and the factors considered by, and the analysis and\nresulting conclusions of, the Special Committee and the Board, the Bain Shareholder believes that the going\nprivate transaction and the Merger is fair to the Unaffiliated Shareholders of the Company based upon\nsubstantially the same factors described under \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons of the Company for the Merger.\u201d\nThe Bain Shareholder agrees with the analyses, determinations and conclusions described under \u201cSpecial\nFactors-Recommendation of the Diversey Board of Directors and Special Committee,\u201d \u201cSpecial Factors-\u200b\nReasons for the Merger- Recommendation of the Special Committee,\u201d \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons for the\nMerger-Recommendation of the Diversey Board,\u201d \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons of the Parent Entities for the\nMerger\u201d and \u201cSpecial Factors-Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,\u201d and the Bain\nShareholder expressly adopts the analyses and opinions of the Special Committee and the Board in reaching\nits determination as to the fairness of the Transactions.\nNone of the Company\u2019s directors that are affiliates of the Bain Shareholder served on the Special\nCommittee nor did they participate in the Special Committee\u2019s evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the going private transaction and the Merger. For these\nreasons, the Bain Shareholder does not believe that its interests in the going private transaction and the\nMerger influenced the decisions or recommendations of the Special Committee or the Board with respect to\nthe Merger Agreement, going private transaction or the Merger.\nIn its consideration of the fairness of the proposed going private transaction and the Merger, the Bain\nShareholder did not find it practicable to, and did not: (i) appraise the assets of the Company to determine\nthe liquidation value for the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Shareholders, (ii) consider the net book value as a basis\nto evaluate per Ordinary Share consideration, (iii) consider that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds\nsubstantially less than sales of a going concern, (iv) consider the impracticability of determining a\nliquidation value given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup, or (v) consider the Company\u2019s\nviability as a going concern. The Bain Shareholder did not consider net book value, which is an accounting\nconcept, for purposes of determining the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated\nShareholders because, in their view, it does not reflect, or have any meaningful impact on, either the market\ntrading prices of the Ordinary Shares or the Company\u2019s value as a going concern. The Bain Shareholder is\nnot aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company\u2019s assets, or a\npurchase of a controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from\nanyone other than a filing person in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Bain\nShareholder in connection with the fairness of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated\nthereby, including that the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material\nfactors considered by the Bain Shareholder.

The Bain Shareholder believes these factors provide a reasonable basis upon\nwhich to form the belief that the going private transaction and the Merger are fair to the Company\u2019s\nUnaffiliated Shareholders. This belief should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any\nCompany shareholder to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Bain Shareholder did not make any\nrecommendation as to how shareholders of the Company should vote their Ordinary Shares relating to the\ngoing private transaction and the Merger.\nPlans for the Company After the Merger\nFollowing completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company,\nwith the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Ordinary Shares are\ncurrently listed on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act. Following completion of the Merger, there\nwill be no further public market for the Ordinary Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the\nEffective Time and in compliance with applicable law, the Ordinary Shares will be delisted from Nasdaq and\nderegistered under the Exchange Act.\nThe Parent Entities currently anticipate that following completion of the Merger, the Company\u2019s\noperations will be conducted substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company\nwill cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent). The Parent\nEntities are currently conducting a review of the Company and its business and operations with a view\ntowards determining how to redirect the Company\u2019s operations to improve the Company\u2019s long-term\nearnings potential as a private company (including by reducing the Company\u2019s costs and expenses following\nthe Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following\ncompletion of the Merger, the Parent Entities will continue to assess the Company\u2019s assets, corporate and\ncapital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties and personnel to determine what additional\nchanges, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of the\nCompany. The Parent Entities expect to enhance the Company\u2019s business and operations by taking\nadvantage of certain expected synergies resulting from the combination of the Company\u2019s business with\nSolenis, a portfolio company of Platinum. Solenis is focused on water treatment solutions, which are\ncomplementary to the products offered by the Company. Through combining Solenis and Diversey, the\nParent Entities expect to create a more diversified business with increased scale, broader global reach and\nsuperior customer service capabilities. The Parent Entities expect this will enable the combined company to\ngrow and benefit from cross-selling opportunities. In addition, the Parent Entities may seek to buy or\ncombine the Company with target companies that provide additional earnings and growth synergies\u037e\nhowever, no such contracts, arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understandings regarding any\nsuch transactions relating to the Company and its subsidiaries currently exist.\nFrom and after the Effective Time of the Merger, (a) the directors of the Surviving Company will be the\ndirectors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with\nthe provisions of the CICA and the memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Company until\ntheir respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, and (b) the officers of the Surviving\nCompany will be the officers of the Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold\noffice in accordance with the provisions of the CICA and the memorandum and articles of association of the\nSurviving Company until their respective successors are duly appointed.\nAt the Effective Time, the memorandum and articles of association of the Surviving Company shall be\namended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in exhibit to the Merger Agreement, until thereafter\namended as provided by the CICA and such memorandum and articles of association.",

See \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nManagement Projections\nThe Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term consolidated forecasts as to\nfuture performance, earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability\nand subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including a\nsummary of certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information for the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2023 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 (collectively, the \u201cManagement\nProjections\u201d) that select members of the Company\u2019s management provided to the Special Committee and the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s advisors in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The Management\nProjections were prepared on a stand-alone basis and do not take into account any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any costs incurred in connection with the Merger, or any\nchanges to the Company\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the completion of the\nMerger. As a result, actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the\nManagement Projections. You should note that Management Projections constitute forward-looking\nstatements.\nThe Company\u2019s management provided the Management Projections to the Special Committee, and the\nSpecial Committee directed Evercore to use the Management Projections in connection with performing\n48 TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncertain of its financial analyses in connection with its opinion, as described in more detail in the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of the Special Committee\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d The\nManagement Projections were also made available to representatives of Platinum the Bain Shareholder, J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC and Centerview Partners LLC. The summaries of these projections are being included\nin this proxy statement solely to give Company shareholders access to non-public information that was\nprovided to Evercore in the course of evaluating the Merger and are not included in this proxy statement to\ninfluence any Company shareholder to vote for the Merger Proposal, to vote against the Merger Proposal, or\nfor any other purpose. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of\nthe Company, its advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or\nnow considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future performance or events, or that it should be\nconstrued as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should not be relied on as\nsuch.\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the Management Projections reflect numerous estimates and\nassumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company, including, among\nothers, the Company\u2019s assumptions about supply chain constraints, commodity prices, production and sales\nvolume levels, operating results, competitive conditions, technology, availability of capital resources, levels\nof capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, inflation and the supply of and demand for its\nproducts, as well as the other matters described in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Factors Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The Management Projections reflect both assumptions as to certain business\ndecisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus are susceptible to\nmultiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The\nCompany can give no assurance that the Management Projections and the underlying estimates and\nassumptions will be realized. In addition, since the Management Projections cover multiple years, such\ninformation by its nature becomes more speculative with each successive year. This information constitutes\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected.\nSee \u201cCautionary Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they\nprepared with a view toward compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d),\npublished guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.\nThese non GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures\nand may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFurthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges\nand credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board\nof directors in connection with a business combination transaction, such as the Management Projections,\nare excluded from the definition of \u201cnon GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and\nregulations. As a result, the Management Projections are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of\nnon-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm,\nnor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect\nto the Management Projections, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on\nsuch information or its achievability. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm to the\nCompany contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to\nhistorical financial information of the Company, and such report does not extend to the projections included\nbelow and should not be read to do so.\nFurthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events\noccurring after the date they were prepared. The Company can give no assurance that, had the Management\nProjections been prepared as of the date of this proxy statement, similar estimates and assumptions would be\nused. Except as required by applicable securities laws, the Company does not intend to, and disclaims any\nobligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the Management Projections to reflect\ncircumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events,\n49 \n(1) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neven in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error or to reflect changes\nin general economic or industry conditions. The Management Projections do not take into account all the\npossible financial and other effects on the Company of the Merger, the effect on the Company of any\nbusiness or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement\nhaving been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have\nbeen taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated,\npostponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the Management Projections do not take into\naccount the effect on the Company of any possible failure of consummation of the Merger and should not be\nviewed as accurate or continuing in that context. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors,\nadvisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation\nto any Company shareholder or other person regarding the Company\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the\ninformation contained in the Management Projections or to the effect that the forecasted results will be\nachieved. The inclusion of the Management Projections herein should not be deemed an admission or\nrepresentation by the Company or its advisors or any other person that it is viewed as material information\nof the Company, particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts.\nIn light of the foregoing, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Company\nshareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information, and the Company urges all of its\nshareholders to review the Company\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company\u2019s reported\nfinancial results.\nCertain Assumptions\nIn preparing the Management Projections described below, the Company\u2019s management team used the\nfollowing foreign exchange rate assumptions:\nManagement \nProjections\nMarket Rate Estimates\n2022E\u202f-\u202f2027E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\nCurrency Pair\nEUR/USD\n1.082\n1.10\n1.12\n1.13\n1.09\n1.11\nCAD/USD\n0.739\n0.760\n0.770\n0.750\n0.780\n0.740\nTRY/USD\n0.045\n0.049\n0.045\n0.03\n0.034\n0.034\nGBP/USD\n1.246\n1.25\n1.28\n1.29\n1.24\n1.26\nINR/USD\n0.0119\n0.0123\n0.0123\n0.0122\n0.0126\n0.0126\nSource: WM/Refinitiv, FactSet Economic Estimates according to broker estimates collection.\nIn addition to the assumptions with respect to foreign exchange rates, the Management Projections are\nbased on various other assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following principal assumptions:\nrevenue and expenses for the years 2023 - 2027 per the Company\u2019s 2023 budget and five-year\nforecast\u037e\ncompletion of Company initiatives and investments to optimize the Company\u2019s supply chain in North\nAmerica\u037e\nimpact on the Company by macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressure and a potential\nrecession in Europe in 2023\u037e and\nability by the Company to invest in attractive capital expenditure and acquisition opportunities.\n50 \n(1)\n",

Zanotti, the\nmembers of the Special Committee, is a director who is not directly or indirectly affiliated with, and who is\notherwise independent from, the Bain Shareholder and Platinum, and also is not a member of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, received a fee of $100,000\u037e and (b) Mr. Foss, who acted as the Chairman of the Special\nCommittee, received an additional fee of $25,000, in each case, in connection with his services to the\nCompany with respect to the Merger (which fee is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger). The\naggregate fees paid to the members of the Special Committee totaled $525,000.\nTreatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards\nDiversey equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the\nfollowing treatment:\nEach Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be\ncancelled without payment (whether in cash or other consideration).\nEach Restricted Ordinary Share will automatically vest and be cancelled and converted into the right\nto receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the Merger Consideration.\nEach Unvested Non-IPO RSU and Unvested IPO RSU, in each case that is held by a non-employee\ndirector of the Company, and each Vested Company PSU, Vested Company RSU and 2022 Bonus RSU\nwill automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on\nthe Merger Consideration.\nEach Transaction Bonus RSU and each Unvested IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a\nnon-employee director of the Company will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash, based on the Merger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2023,\nsubject to continued employment through the payment date, with accelerated vesting protection\nupon a Qualifying Termination.\nEach Unvested Company PSU, Unvested Closing RSU, Retention RSU and TRA RSU will\nautomatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, based on the\nMerger Consideration, payable on December 31, 2024, subject to continued employment through the\npayment date, with accelerated vesting protection upon a Qualifying Termination for each Unvested\nCompany PSU, Unvested Closing RSU and TRA RSU.\nEach Unvested IPO Celebration RSU will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash, based upon the Merger Consideration, payable on March 25, 2024, subject\nto continued employment through the payment date.\nEach Unvested Non-IPO RSU that is held by an individual other than a non-employee director of the\nCompany will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash, based on the\nMerger Consideration, with 50% payable on December 31, 2023, and 50% payable on December 31,\n2024, subject to continued employment through the payment date, with full accelerated vesting upon\na Qualifying Termination.\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll payments made in connection with the treatment of Diversey equity awards are subject to\nwithholding taxes as required by law.\nThe equity awards held by the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers at the Effective Time will\ngenerally be subject to the same treatment as the equity awards held by other holders, as such treatment is\ndescribed above. For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the\nMerger occurs on May 11, 2023, and assuming that each of the named executive officers experiences a\nQualifying Termination on that date, see \u201cSpecial Factors-Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d below. We estimate that the value of unvested\nequity awards held by the two executive officers, other than the named executive officers, that would vest\nassuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 11, 2023, and that such two executive officers experience\nQualifying Terminations on that date is $2,342,970. In addition, such two executive officers were granted an\naggregate of 200,000 Retention RSUs, which are not included in the estimated value set forth in the\nimmediately preceding sentence, as vesting and payment in respect of the Retention RSUs is subject to\ncontinued employment through the vesting date, and the executive officers are not entitled to accelerated\nvesting with respect to their Retention RSUs upon any termination that occurs prior to December 31, 2024\u037e\ntherefore, such executive officers would not receive any payments with respect to their Retention RSUs\nunder the assumptions noted in the immediately preceding sentence. The Retention RSUs will be treated as\ndescribed in \u201cSpecial Factors-Treatment of Ordinary Shares and Outstanding Equity Awards\u201d and entitle\nsuch two executive officers to payment in an aggregate amount of $1,680,000 (subject to any applicable\nwithholding taxes) on December 31, 2024, subject to their continued employment through such date. We\nestimate that the aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-employee directors of Diversey\nthat would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on May 11, 2023 is $2,414,714.\nSeverance Entitlements\nEach of Messrs. Wieland and Herndon and Ms. Kwant is party to an employment agreement with a\nsubsidiary of Diversey. In the event of a termination without Cause (including, for Mr. Herndon, due to\nDiversey\u2019s non-renewal of his employment term) or, for Messrs. Wieland and Herndon, a termination for\n\u201cgood reason\u201d  (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), each of Messrs. Wieland and\nHerndon and Ms. Kwant is entitled to an amount equal to the sum of his or her (i) base salary and (ii) target\nannual incentive opportunity, payable, for Mr. Wieland and Ms. Kwant, in either a lump sum or in ratable\ninstallments over the 12-month post-termination period, and, for Mr. Herndon, in ratable installments over\nthe 12-month post termination period. Mr. Herndon is also entitled to 12 months of Company-subsidized\nCOBRA coverage (terminable earlier if he obtains other employment that offers group health benefits). The\nseverance entitlements for Messrs. Wieland and Herndon and Ms. Kwant are subject to their execution and\nnon-revocation of a release of claims and continued compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in\ntheir respective employment agreements.\nEach of Messrs. Redaelli, Verheul and Gundogdu is party to an offer letter with a subsidiary of Diversey.\nThe offer letters do not provide for severance, but Messrs. Redaelli, Verheul and Gundogdu are entitled to\nseverance in the event of a termination without Cause, with (a) Mr. Redaelli's severance determined pursuant\nto Italy's statutory severance rules (which entitle him to an amount equal to the sum of (i) 42 months of his\nbase salary and (ii) his target annual incentive), (b) Mr. Verheul's severance determined pursuant to the\nnegotiated arrangement with the local works council (which entitles him to an amount equal to the sum of (i)\nhis base salary and (ii) average annual incentive paid for the three fiscal years immediately preceding his\ntermination) and (c) Mr. Gundogdu\u2019s severance equals the sum of his (i) annual base salary and (ii) target\nannual incentive opportunity and is payable in ratable installments over the 12-month post-termination\nperiod.\nMs. Long is party to an offer letter with a subsidiary of Diversey that provides for severance\nentitlements. In the event Ms. Long\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d  (as defined in the offer\nletter), Ms. Long is entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of her (a) annual base salary and (b) target\nannual incentive opportunity, payable in ratable installments over the 12-month post termination period. If\nMs. Long experiences a termination without \u201ccause\u201d or an \u201cinvoluntary termination\u201d prior to December 31,\n2024, a pro-rata number of RSUs that were granted as a sign-on bonus will vest upon her date of termination\nof employment. These severance entitlements are subject to Ms. Long\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a\nrelease\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nof claims, the provision of reasonable transition services following termination and continued compliance\nwith applicable restrictive covenants.\nIn connection with the Merger, Parent has acknowledged that as of the Effective Time, each of Messrs.\nWieland and Herndon will (i) have \u201cgood reason\u201d immediately following the consummation of the Merger, (ii)\nthereafter have the right to terminate employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d, and (iii) be entitled to the rights and\nbenefits due to each of them upon a termination for \u201cgood reason\u201d, in each case, subject to such executive\nofficer\u2019s general release of claims in favor of Diversey and its subsidiaries (and their successors).\n280G Mitigation Actions\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Diversey may, in consultation with Parent, implement strategies before\nthe Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d for \u201cdisqualified\nindividuals\u201d  (each as defined in Section 280G of the Code), including the executive officers. As of the date of\nthis proxy statement, Diversey has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate any impact of Section\n280G of the Code on Diversey or any disqualified individuals. No executive officer is entitled to receive\ngross-ups or tax reimbursements from Diversey with respect to any potential excise taxes.\nFuture Arrangements\nSome or all of Diversey\u2019s executive officers may discuss entering into agreements, arrangements or\nunderstandings with Parent or its affiliates regarding the executive officer\u2019s continuing employment or\ncompensation and benefits, including equity incentive arrangements, on a going-forward basis effective\nupon and contingent upon the Closing. No such new agreements, arrangements or understandings have\nbeen entered into as of the date of this proxy statement.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the\ncompensation for each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to\nthe Merger, which is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules\nand which is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of our shareholders, as described below in the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 2. The Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Proposal\u201d beginning on\npage 73. The individuals disclosed within this section and referred to as the \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d are\nthe Company\u2019s current principal executive officer, current principal financial officer and three most highly\ncompensated executive officers (other than the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) as\ndisclosed in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company\u2019s most recently filed Annual Report on Form\n10-K/A, filed with the SEC on April 27, 2023.\nThe amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not\nactually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement and in the footnotes to the table. As\na result, the actual amounts, if any, that a named executive officer will receive may materially differ from the\namounts set forth in the table. The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the Company\u2019s\nnamed executive officers were already entitled to receive or vested in as of the date hereof or amounts under\ncontracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or\noperation in favor of executive officers and that are available generally to all the salaried employees of the\nCompany.\nThe table below assumes that (1) the Effective Time will occur on May 11, 2023 (the latest practicable\ndate before the filing of this proxy statement)\u037e (2) the employment of the named executive officer will be\nterminated immediately following the Effective Time in a manner entitling the named executive officer to\nreceive severance payments and benefits under the terms of the named executive officer\u2019s employment\narrangement\u037e (3) the named executive officer\u2019s base salary rate remains unchanged from the rate in place as\nof May 11, 2023\u037e (4) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants on or prior to the\nEffective Time\u037e and (5) no named executive officer enters into new agreements or is otherwise legally entitled,\nprior to the Effective Time, to additional compensation or benefits.

The Retention RSUs are not included in the table below, however, as vesting and\npayment in respect of the Retention RSUs is subject to continued employment through the vesting date, and\nMs. Kwant and Mr. Verheul are not entitled to accelerated vesting with respect to their Retention RSUs upon\nany termination that occurs prior to December 31, 2024\u037e therefore, Ms. Kwant and Mr. Verheul would not\nreceive any payments with respect to their Retention RSUs under the assumptions noted above.

Pursuant to the Rollover\nAgreement, at the joint election of Topco and the Bain Shareholder, the parties may structure the exchange\nso that in lieu of Topco issuing preferred units to the Bain Shareholder, the Bain Shareholder contributes,\ntransfers and assigns a portion of the Rollover Shares to a subsidiary of Topco in exchange for preferred\ninterests in such subsidiary, in which case following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by\nthe Rollover Agreement, the Bain Shareholder would own common units of Topco and preferred interests in\nsuch subsidiary. The Rollover Shares represent approximately 56.1% of the Ordinary Shares held by the Bain\nShareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (which amount is subject to increase up to approximately\n61.5% if, prior to the Closing and pursuant to the Rollover Agreement, Topco elects to cause the Bain\nShareholder to contribute additional Ordinary Shares in exchange for additional preferred units of Topco (or,\nin certain cases, a subsidiary of Topco)).

The following\ndiscussion is based upon the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and existing\nadministrative rulings and court decisions, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These\nauthorities are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any\nchange could affect the validity of the following discussion. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not\nchallenge one or more of the tax considerations described herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to\nseek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the\nfollowing summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or\nthat a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nThis discussion is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation\nthat may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any\naspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax, estate tax, or any aspects of the tax\non \u201cnet investment income\u201d imposed under Section 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address\nany special tax rules applicable to particular shareholders such as shareholders that are financial institutions,\ntax-exempt organizations, S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or\npass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities or arrangements),\ninsurance companies, dealers in securities or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method\nof accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, shareholders who acquired\ntheir Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of compensatory share options or otherwise in connection\nwith the performance of services, U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, U.S.\nexpatriates, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, any person who receives\nconsideration other than cash in the Merger (or any transaction related thereto), retirement plans or other\ntax-deferred accounts, entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules, shareholders that own or have owned\n(directly, indirectly or constructive) 5% of more of the Company\u2019s common shares (including the Bain\nShareholder), shareholders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving\nCompany following the Merger, shareholders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item\nof gross income with respect to the Ordinary Shares being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial\nstatement\u201d  (as defined in Sections 56A and 451(b) of the Code) and shareholders who hold their Ordinary\nShares as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. The\nfollowing discussion does not address tax consequences to the persons subject to the base erosion and\nanti-abuse tax. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders who hold their Ordinary Shares as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not\naddress the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand dissenter rights under Section 238\nof CICA. In addition, the following discussion does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax\nconsequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the Merger (whether\nor not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the Merger).\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares that is (i)\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United\nStates or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as such for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its\nsource, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United\n58 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nStates and all of the substantial decisions of which one or more United States persons, as defined in Section\n7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control, or (b) that has a valid election in effect under the\napplicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a \u201cUnited States person\u201d under the Code.\nIf a partnership or another entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes is the owner of Ordinary Shares, the tax treatment of the partner or owner in such partnership or\nother entity or arrangement will depend upon the status of the partner or owner, the activities of the\npartnership or other entity or arrangement and certain determinations made at the partner or owner level.\nAccordingly, partnerships and other entities or arrangements classified as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes that hold Ordinary Shares and partners or owners of such partnerships or other entities\nor arrangements, as applicable, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the\nMerger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE DATE HEREOF.\nHOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARES ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE\nSPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT\nOF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.\nIn General\nThe Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. Subject to the discussion in the following\nparagraph regarding the \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d or \u201cPFIC\u201d rules, in general, a U.S. Holder will\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the surrendered Ordinary Shares. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of\nOrdinary Shares at different times or at different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss\nseparately for each block of Ordinary Shares exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss\ngenerally will be capital gain or loss, and any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for the Ordinary Shares is greater than one (1) year as of the Closing.\nA reduced rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder.\nThe deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. It is possible, however, that the IRS may\nrecharacterize a portion of the proceeds in a manner that results in a different character of income, including\nordinary income as a result of a recharacterization of the Merger consideration for tax purposes.\nIf the Company is a PFIC for the current taxable year or has been a PFIC during any prior taxable year in\nwhich a U.S. Holder held Ordinary Shares, special rules would apply to such U.S. Holder\u2019s disposition of\nOrdinary Shares in the Merger. Generally, a foreign corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year\nin which (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the value (for a publicly\ntraded foreign corporation, based on an average of the quarterly value of the assets) of its assets are\nconsidered \u201cpassive assets\u201d  (generally, assets that generate passive income). Based on the historic, current\nand anticipated value of the Company\u2019s assets and the composition of its income and assets, the Company\ndoes not believe that it was a PFIC for the taxable year that ended on December 31, 2022 or the taxable year\nthat ended on December 31, 2021, nor does the Company expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year.\nHowever, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus, for the current taxable\nyear, will not be determinable until the close of the current taxable year. If, contrary to this expectation,\nDiversey were to be treated as a PFIC for any applicable tax year during which a U.S. Holder held Ordinary\nShares, such classification could result in adverse tax consequences to such U.S. Holder different from the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences described above. These adverse consequences include recognition of\nordinary income rather than capital gain from the disposition of Ordinary Shares, taxation at the highest rate\nin effect for individuals or corporations, as applicable, and punitive interest charges. Generally, certain of the\nadverse rules described above would not apply if such U.S. Holder had timely made, with respect to its\nOrdinary Shares, (x) a mark-to-market election, or (y) a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election. There is no\nassurance that we will provide information that will enable investors to make a qualified electing fund\nelection.\nThe application of the PFIC rules is complex and subject to uncertainty in several respects, and the\nCompany cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a contrary position with respect to any such taxable\n59 \n",

Backup withholding generally will apply only if the U.S. Holder fails\nto furnish a correct TIN or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding rules and\ncertification requirements. Corporations are generally exempt from backup withholding. Each U.S. Holder\nshould complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 (or substitute or successor form) included with the letter of\ntransmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that the TIN on such form is correct and that such U.S.\nHolder is not subject to backup withholding. If a U.S. Holder fails to provide the correct TIN or certification,\npayments received may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a 24% rate. Backup withholding is not\nan additional tax. Amounts so withheld can be credited against such U.S. Holder\u2019s federal income tax liability\nand may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to\nthe IRS.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION\nOF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO U.S. HOLDERS. IN\nADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR\nARE CONTINGENT ON, A SHAREHOLDER\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF\nSHAREHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-\nINCOME TAX OR ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY,\nEACH SHAREHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH SUCH SHAREHOLDER\u2019S OWN TAX\nADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SUCH\nSHAREHOLDER.\nFinancing of the Merger\nIt is presently anticipated that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related\nTransactions will be approximately $4.6 billion, which will be funded via the Financing contemplated by the\nCommitment Letters, respectively, described below and the transactions contemplated by the Rollover\nAgreement.\nParent and Merger Sub have represented to the Company that the Financing, when funded in\naccordance with the Commitment Letters and after giving effect to any \u201cflex\u201d provision in or related to the\nDebt Commitment Letter (including with respect to fees and original issue discount) will provide Parent with\ncash proceeds on the Closing Date of the Merger sufficient to pay the Required Amount.\nEquity Financing\nOn March 8, 2023, Parent entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with each of the Platinum Entities,\npursuant to which the Platinum Entities have committed to, directly or indirectly through one or more\nintermediaries, capitalize Parent at the Closing with the Equity Financing.

The form of the Voting Agreement is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. See \u201cSpecial\nFactors-Voting Agreement\u201d beginning on page 62 of this proxy.\nVoting and Proxies\nHolders of record of Ordinary Shares may vote their Ordinary Shares by attending the Special Meeting\nand voting their Ordinary Shares in person. Alternatively, you may have your Ordinary Shares voted in one\nof the following three ways, whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting:\nby submitting a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number on your proxy card and\nfollowing the telephone voting instructions\u037e\nby submitting a proxy over the Internet at the URL provided on your proxy card and following the\nInternet voting instructions\u037e or\nby marking, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in its accompanying\npostage-paid envelope.\nIf you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, your voting instructions must be\nreceived by 11:59 p.m. ET on June 7, 2023.\nSubmitting a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail will not prevent you from voting in person\nat the Special Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by mail,\neven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, to ensure that your Ordinary Shares are represented at the\nSpecial Meeting.\nAll Ordinary Shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the Special\nMeeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in the manner specified by the holder. If you return a properly\nsigned and dated proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your Ordinary Shares\nwill be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory and non-binding Named Executive Officer\nMerger-Related Compensation Proposal. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the\nshareholders meeting, all Ordinary Shares represented by proxies received by the Company will be voted\nwith respect to such matter in accordance with the judgment of the persons named as in the proxies.\nIf your Ordinary Shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you will receive instructions from your brokerage firm,\nbank or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your Ordinary Shares voted. If you have not\nreceived such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact\nyour brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, as the case may be. Brokers who hold Ordinary Shares in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d for a beneficial owner of those Ordinary Shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion\non \u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner. However,\nbrokers are not allowed to vote with respect to the approval of matters that are \u201cnon-routine,\u201d such as the\nMerger Proposal, without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes, with respect to\nany proposal, are Ordinary Shares held by a broker or other nominee present or represented at a meeting at\nwhich at least one \u201croutine\u201d proposal is presented, but with respect to which the broker or other nominee is\nnot instructed by the beneficial owner of such Ordinary Shares to vote on the particular proposal and the\nbroker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because all proposals for the Special\nMeeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, the Company anticipates that there will not be any broker\nnon-votes in connection with any proposal. If your broker or other nominee holds your Ordinary Shares in\n\u201cstreet name,\u201d your broker or other nominee will vote your Ordinary Shares only if you\n68 ",

All notices and\npetitions must be executed by or for the shareholder of record, fully and correctly, as such shareholder\u2019s name appears\non the register of shareholders of the Company. As noted above, a dissenting shareholder must dissent in respect of all\nthe Ordinary Shares which he, she or it holds. If the Ordinary Shares are registered in the name of a person who\nholds them in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, these notices must be executed by or for\nthe fiduciary. If the Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of more than one person, such notices and petitions\nmust be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute the notices or petitions for a shareholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner and\nexpressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the notice, he is acting as agent for the record owner. A PERSON\nHAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN ORDINARY SHARES WHICH ARE REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF\nANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE\nDISSENTERS\u2019 RIGHTS DIRECTLY IN RESPECT OF SUCH SHARES, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CONTACT\nSUCH PERSON IN ORDER TO BECOME THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF SUCH SHARES, IN ORDER TO BE\nABLE TO EXERCISE SUCH DISSENTERS\u2019 RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF SUCH SHARES.\nIf you do not satisfy each of these requirements, you cannot exercise Dissenters\u2019 Rights and will receive the per\nshare Merger Consideration of $8.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each\nOrdinary Share you hold. You must send all notices to Diversey Holdings, Ltd., 1300 Altura Road, Suite 125, Fort Mill,\nSC 29708.\nIf you are considering dissenting, you should be aware that the fair value of your Ordinary Shares determined\nunder Section 238 of the CICA could be more than, the same as, or less than the $8.40 in cash, without interest and\nless any applicable withholding taxes, for each Ordinary Share that you would otherwise receive as consideration in\nthe Merger. In addition, in any proceedings for determination of the fair value of Ordinary Shares covered by a Notice\nof Dissent, the Company intends to assert that the per share Merger Consideration of $8.40 is equal to the fair value of\neach of your Ordinary Shares.\nThe provisions of Section 238 of the CICA are technical and complex. If you fail to comply strictly with the\nprocedures set forth in Section 238 of the CICA, you will lose your Dissenters\u2019 Rights. You should consult your\nCayman Islands legal counsel if you wish to exercise Dissenters\u2019 Rights.\n112 \n",
