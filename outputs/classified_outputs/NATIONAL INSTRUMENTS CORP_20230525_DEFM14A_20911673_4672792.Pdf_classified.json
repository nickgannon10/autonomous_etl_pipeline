If you attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your\nvote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $60.00 in cash,\nwithout interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of NI common stock that you own (other\nthan any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and validly\nexercised (and do not withdraw) your appraisal rights in accordance with, and complied with, Section 262 of the\nDGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of NI common stock, you will receive $6,000 in cash in exchange for\nyour shares of NI common stock (other than any Unconverted Shares), without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes. Unconverted Shares means (a) each share held by any subsidiary of either NI or Parent (other\nthan Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be converted into such number of shares of\ncommon stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the\noutstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such\nsubsidiary owned in NI immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) each share that is owned by NI as treasury\nstock or otherwise (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under\nany of the Company Equity Plans or the Company ESPP) or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and (c) shares that are issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in (a) and (b)) and that are held by\nholders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented\nthereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such Shares, as applicable.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of NI common stock?\nA:\nThe exchange of NI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of NI common stock for cash in the\nMerger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of\ncash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of NI\ncommon stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.\nThis proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state,\nlocal, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment\nunder U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax\nconsequences to you of the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock entitled to vote\nthereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNI common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to\napprove the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of NI common stock\nrepresenting a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by\nproxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any NI stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed\nproxy card\u037e (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in\nthe section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d)\u037e or (c) attend\nthe Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but,\nassuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nMerger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign\nyour proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares\nrepresented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote present in person,\nor by remote communication, or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Because\nthere were 132,774,458 shares of NI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record Date, we\nwill need holders of at least 66,387,230 shares present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by\nproxy at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by NI stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other\nreason, NI stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of NI common stock. Instead, NI will\nremain an independent public company, NI common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and NI will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, NI will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $310 million, upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement - Termination Fees.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are NI stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require NI to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with\nrespect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if NI stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on NI. Therefore, if the\napproval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable\nunder the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to NI\u2019s named executive officers in accordance\nwith the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements regardless of whether the Compensation Proposal is\napproved.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as\n1\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthey contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign,\ndate and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope,\nor grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed\nin the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d), so that\nyour shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the\nvoting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nShould I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures\u201d) will, as soon as reasonably practical after the\nEffective Time, and in any event not later than two business days following the Closing Date, send each holder\nof record of NI common stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,\n(A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions that explain how to surrender certificates or book-entry shares of\nNI common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of NI common stock after the Record Date but before\nthe Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger\nis expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of NI common stock after the Record Date but\nbefore the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you\nand the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies NI in writing of such\nspecial arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,\nto the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the\nSpecial Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of NI common stock after the Record Date,\nwe encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\nor grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed\nin the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as an NI stockholder of record and holding shares in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered to\nbe the \u201cstockholder of record\u201d with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy\ncard have been sent directly to you by NI.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of NI common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you\nby your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the NI stockholder\nof record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to vote on the Internet, by telephone or, if you received a\npaper copy of the proxy materials, by completing, signing and mailing the proxy card enclosed therewith in the\npostage-prepaid envelope provided for that purpose.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are an NI stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of NI common stock are registered in your name\nwith Computershare, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nInternet: Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting.

Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d may be voted at the\nSpecial Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or\nother nominee.\nIf your shares of NI common stock are held \u201cin street name\u201d by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder of\nyour shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on\nhow to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or by telephone.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to\nensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of\nwhich are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail.

If you are an NI stockholder of record, or beneficially in street name, you can vote\nby proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy\ncard. If you hold shares beneficially in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should follow the voting instructions provided by\nyour bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nIf an NI stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process\nor the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting\non all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement\nProposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted\nagainst the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy\nstatement.

Please note that virtual attendance at the Special Meeting will not by itself\nconstitute revocation of a proxy.\nAny change to your proxy that is provided by telephone or the Internet must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern\nDaylight Time on June 28, 2023.\nIf you hold your shares of NI common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other\nnominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the\nSpecial Meeting website.\nIf you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:\nMACKENZIE PARTNERS, INC.\n\u2003\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, NY 10018\nToll-Free: (800) 322-2885\nEmail: proxy@mackenziepartners.com\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of NI common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than\none account. For example, you may own some shares directly as an NI stockholder of record and other shares\nthrough a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive\nmultiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares\nyou own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by\nmail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address\nwith another NI stockholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for\nproxy statements with respect to two or more NI stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single\nproxy statement to those NI stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d\npotentially provides extra convenience for NI stockholders and cost savings for companies.\nNI and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to\nmultiple NI stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been\nreceived from the affected NI stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and\nwould prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these\ndocuments and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify our investor\nrelations department at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759, (512) 683-5215, or, if the latter, you\nmay also contact your broker or other nominee record holder.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In\naddition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, NI will file the final voting\nresults of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results)\nwith the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nA:\nNI has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as \u201cMacKenzie,\u201d to assist in the solicitation of\nproxies for the Special Meeting. NI estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $50,000, plus\nreimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. NI has agreed to indemnify MacKenzie against\nvarious liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain\nexceptions).\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNI also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for\ntheir expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of NI common stock. NI directors, officers and\nemployees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any\nadditional amounts for soliciting proxies.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect the Merger to be completed in the first half of Emerson\u2019s fiscal year 2024. However, the exact\ntiming of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions\nspecified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our\ncontrol.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about NI?\nA:\nNI will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2023 Annual Report\nto Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (which\nwe refer to as \u201cAnnual Report\u201d), without charge to any NI stockholder who makes a request in writing to our\nCorporate Secretary at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nOn May 16, 2022, Lal Karsanbhai, President and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson, contacted Eric Starkloff,\nNI\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, regarding Emerson\u2019s potential interest in an acquisition of NI. Mr. Starkloff\nand Mr. Karsanbhai spoke on May 25, 2022, during which Mr. Karsanbhai indicated that Emerson was interested in a\npotential acquisition of NI.\nOn May 25, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the \u201cMay 25 Letter\u201d). The May 25 Letter contained a proposal\nto acquire all of the outstanding shares of NI for $48 in cash per share. The May 25 Letter noted, among other things,\nthat Emerson\u2019s proposal was based on publicly available information and was subject to the completion of customary\nand confirmatory due diligence. The May 25 Letter also noted that the proposal was not subject to any financing\ncondition and that Emerson was prepared to work with NI and its advisors to complete due diligence and negotiate a\nmutually agreeable merger agreement in parallel.\nOn May 26, 2022, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) met, with representatives of its legal counsel, Wachtell,\nLipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) in attendance. The Board and management discussed the May 25 Letter,\ncurrent NI strategy and business performance as well as prior discussions with the Board regarding NI\u2019s prospects\nand positioning, engagement of outside advisors and other next steps. The Board agreed to reconvene in June to\ncontinue the discussion, including with the assistance of outside financial advisors and its legal advisors at Wachtell\nLipton.\nBetween May 26 and June 10, 2022, NI retained BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA Securities\u201d) as financial advisor to\nNI in connection with its consideration of the May 25 Letter. BofA Securities was selected based on its qualifications,\nexperience and reputation in the technology sector and its knowledge of NI\u2019s business and affairs. NI executed an\nengagement letter with BofA Securities on June 10, 2022 with respect to BofA Securities advising NI regarding the\nMay 25 Letter. In connection with its engagement by NI, BofA Securities provided a relationship disclosure letter\nproviding certain information regarding its relationships with NI and Emerson, which relationship disclosure letter\nwas subsequently updated on January 22, 2023, February 26, 2023, and April 12, 2023.\nOn June 14, 2022, the Board met, with representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. In\nconsultation with its advisors, the Board and management further discussed the May 25 Letter, NI\u2019s strategy,\nperformance and valuation considerations, and potential responses to Emerson. The Board discussed the timing of\nEmerson\u2019s proposal, taking into account broader market and industry volatility and company-specific circumstances,\nsuch as, among others, that NI\u2019s strategic plan was in the early stages of realization. The Board members concluded\nthat Emerson\u2019s proposal substantially undervalued NI, including relative to the potential value that could be realized\nand unlocked from execution of NI\u2019s strategic plan and relative to the valuation methodologies presented by BofA\nSecurities and discussed with the Board. In light of these considerations, the Board unanimously determined to reject\nEmerson\u2019s proposal and directed management to convey this determination to Emerson.\nOn June 16, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the \u201cJune 16 Letter\u201d), signed by Mr. Starkloff and Michael E.\nMcGrath, Chairman of NI\u2019s Board, which stated that the NI Board had carefully reviewed the\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nMay 25 Letter, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and that the Board had unanimously determined\nthat the proposal outlined in the May 25 Letter did not provide a basis for further discussions. The June 16 Letter\nalso stated that NI\u2019s Board and management team would remain focused on executing NI\u2019s strategies that are\nproducing a significant and steady increase in bookings and revenue, strengthened operational performance, and\nadvances in technology.\nOn June 22, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the \u201cJune 22 Letter\u201d) stating that Emerson was disappointed in\nNI\u2019s response and reiterated Emerson\u2019s proposal to acquire NI for $48 per share. The June 22 Letter noted that\nEmerson had engaged advisors and was prepared to work with NI and its advisors to complete due diligence and\nnegotiate a mutually agreeable merger agreement. Emerson also requested access to limited nonpublic information\nsubject to a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn July 19 and 20, 2022, the Board held meetings in Austin, Texas, during which members of NI management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton participated. During these meetings, the Board and management discussed the\nJune 22 Letter and various aspects of Emerson\u2019s outreach, including that the June 22 Letter reaffirmed Emerson\u2019s\nprior inadequate proposal, the potential for Emerson to change its offer and the degree to which Emerson would\npursue the potential transaction, the potential for entry into a confidentiality agreement and engaging in due\ndiligence and negotiations with Emerson, and various strategic and financial alternatives. The Board reaffirmed its\nview that Emerson\u2019s proposal was not in the best interests of NI and its stockholders and did not reflect the value\nexpected to be generated by NI\u2019s business strategies. Following discussion, the Board concluded that the proposal\nfrom Emerson did not merit engaging in further discussions with or providing diligence materials to Emerson. The\nBoard also discussed with management and its advisors the potential steps NI could take at the upcoming earnings\ncall to highlight NI\u2019s momentum, prospects, margin priorities and other financial and operating performance matters.\nFollowing discussion, the Board unanimously determined to reaffirm its continued rejection of Emerson\u2019s proposal\nand authorized Mr. McGrath, Mr. Starkloff and R. Eddie Dixon, Jr., NI\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Senior Vice President and\nSecretary, to determine the precise manner and content for communicating the reaffirmed rejection to Emerson.\nOn August 2, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the \u201cAugust 2 Letter\u201d). The August 2 Letter stated that the\nNI Board had carefully reviewed the June 22 Letter, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and that the\nBoard remained unanimously of the view that Emerson\u2019s proposal was not in the best interests of NI and its\nstockholders.\nOn November 3, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the \u201cNovember 3 Letter\u201d), which increased Emerson\u2019s\nproposal to acquire NI from $48 per share to $53 per share. The November 3 Letter further stated that, in preparation\nfor all options, Emerson had accumulated 2.3 million NI shares in the open market and intended to file for approval\nunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) to facilitate additional purchases, and that\nEmerson was prepared to run a slate of directors targeting the two members of the Board up for re-election at NI\u2019s\nnext annual meeting.\nOn November 4, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson confirming receipt of the November 3 Letter and stating\nthat Mr. Starkloff and Mr. McGrath would discuss with the NI Board.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Board met, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. McGrath\nproposed establishing, in the interests of efficiency, an ad hoc committee of the Board, which would meet regularly to\nevaluate, with the input of senior management and the Board\u2019s external legal and financial advisors, proposals as to\nextraordinary transactions made by third parties, including Emerson, and other potential alternative extraordinary\ntransactions and related strategic matters. The committee, which would consist of Mr. McGrath as Chair and James\nCashman, III and Gayla Delly as members, would not have decision making authority, which authority would remain\nwith the full Board. Following discussion, the Board unanimously approved resolutions establishing such a\ncommittee (the \u201cTransaction Evaluation Committee\u201d or the \u201cTEC\u201d). The Board and management discussed the\nproposal from Emerson, other potential strategic partners and synergies with such potential partners. The Board and\nmanagement, along with Wachtell Lipton, discussed next steps for drafting a response to the November 3 Letter.\nWachtell Lipton also discussed the timing of a response in connection with Emerson\u2019s upcoming investor day, and\nthe timing of a potential proxy fight.\nFollowing the Board meeting on November 10, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI\nmanagement and representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The members of the TEC discussed with the\nrepresentatives from Wachtell Lipton the content and tenor of NI\u2019s response to the November 3 Letter,\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich the TEC would draft and submit to the full Board for approval. The members of the TEC and Wachtell Lipton\nalso discussed considerations that would be relevant if Emerson were to make its proposal to acquire NI public and\nhow NI might respond to a public disclosure by Emerson.\nOn November 15, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the \u201cNovember 15 Letter\u201d) stating that NI and its Board\ntake Emerson\u2019s proposal seriously, and notifying Emerson that the Board had established a working group of the\nBoard to examine Emerson\u2019s proposal in greater detail as NI examines and evaluates options with the assistance of its\nadvisors, inclusive of other prospective purchasers and transaction partners.\nOn November 16, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The members of the TEC discussed go-forward approaches with\nrespect to various items, including evaluating potential strategic and business options and actions for NI, the multi-\nyear transformation of NI currently underway, engagement with Emerson following the latest communications\nbetween NI and Emerson, including the November 15 Letter, potential actions that Emerson might take, and the\nlikelihood that other potential transaction partners and acquirers could be interested in pursuing a transaction with\nNI, among other topics.\nLater on November 16, Emerson emailed a notice to NI that Emerson is an \u201cacquiring person\u201d under the HSR Act\nand intended to file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of\nthe Department of Justice to acquire 50% or more of NI voting securities.\nOn November 23, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. They discussed the timing and steps of a typical tender offer and\nresponse and the process of a typical proxy fight, key dates leading to NI\u2019s annual meeting, including NI\u2019s and\nEmerson\u2019s earnings releases, NI\u2019s nomination window for stockholder director nominations, illustrative timing for\nEmerson\u2019s earnings releases, NI\u2019s nomination window for stockholder director nominations, illustrative timing for\nfiling proxy statements in a potential proxy fight, and related SEC deadlines. The members of the TEC also discussed\nNI\u2019s options for potential actions to protect the interests of NI and its stockholders, including the potential adoption\nof a shareholder rights plan.\nOn November 28, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and\nAlexander Davern, director and former Chief Executive Officer of NI, in attendance. The members of the TEC\ndiscussed expectations and timing for upcoming TEC and Board meetings, including a review of the valuation\nanalysis that BofA Securities was preparing based on NI\u2019s updated financial plan. Mr. Starkloff presented NI\u2019s 2023-\n2025 business plan.\nOn December 1, 2022, the independent directors of NI held a meeting during which the members of the\nTransaction Evaluation Committee informed the independent directors of the actions taken to date by the TEC and\nanticipated next steps. Mr. McGrath discussed the business plan that had been presented by Mr. Starkloff at the prior\nTEC meeting and noted that it would be used by BofA Securities for a forthcoming valuation presentation. Mr.\nMcGrath provided an outline of next steps, including a special meeting of the Board to be held on December 11 to\nreview NI\u2019s business plan and BofA Securities\u2019 analysis and to review response options and determine next steps\nwith respect to Emerson or other alternative paths.

The TEC discussed the possibility of initiating a strategic review\nprocess, pursuant to which the Board would review and consider NI\u2019s strategic options, including exploring potential\noffers from third parties to acquire NI, and various considerations concerning whether a strategic review process\nwould be announced publicly or conducted privately. The TEC discussed with its advisors the likely timing for a\npotential strategic review process and the potential outcomes of such a process, including the possibility that the\nBoard could determine at the conclusion of such a process that remaining independent could be in the best interests\nof NI and its stockholders. The TEC and Wachtell Lipton discussed that, as part of any strategic review process,\nEmerson would be encouraged to engage with NI regarding a potential transaction.\nOn December 7, 2022, Sara Bosco, Emerson\u2019s Senior Vice President, Secretary and Chief Legal Officer, sent a\nletter to Mr. Dixon stating that, in connection with Emerson\u2019s anticipated nomination of persons for election to the\nBoard of NI, Emerson requested a copy of the written representation and agreement and the written questionnaire\nrequired under NI\u2019s bylaws to be included in Emerson\u2019s notice of nomination.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 10, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance.

Mr. McGrath and the other members of the TEC then discussed with the Board the\nBoard\u2019s options for responding to Emerson\u2019s proposal and potential next steps by Emerson in reaction to each\npotential response by NI. The TEC conveyed its view that it would be in the best interest of NI\u2019s stockholders to\nexplore initiating a strategic review process pursuant to which the Board would review and consider NI\u2019s strategic\noptions, including any proposals by Emerson.

BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton then\ndiscussed with the Board the next steps for the strategic review process, including which potential counterparties\nshould be invited to participate in the second phase of the process based on the proposals received from each.\nWachtell Lipton also discussed with the Board the regulatory profile of a potential transaction with each of Emerson,\nParty A, Party B, and Party C. Following discussion, the Board authorized management and its advisors to move\nforward with the second phase of the strategic review process and to invite Emerson, Party A, Party B, and Party C to\nparticipate in the second phase.

Wachtell Lipton discussed the\nBoard\u2019s fiduciary duties, including in connection with the consideration of a potential sale transaction for cash\nconsideration. Wachtell Lipton also provided a comparison of the two submitted proposals and discussed with the\nBoard considerations related to regulatory deal certainty and illustrative timing to closing based on expected antitrust\nand foreign investment approvals. The Board discussed with its advisors that Emerson\u2019s proposal committed\nEmerson to taking all requisite actions necessary to obtain regulatory approvals but did not include any reverse\ntermination fee, while Party A\u2019s proposal included a number of significant exceptions to Party A\u2019s commitment to\nobtain regulatory approvals (including limitations on its commitments to undertake divestitures and behavioral\nremedies) and contained a reverse termination fee. Mr. Starkloff and Daniel Berenbaum, NI\u2019s Executive Vice President,\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer, provided an overview of financial metrics for the first quarter of 2023 along with\nan update for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. BofA Securities then provided an overview of NI\u2019s relative share price\nperformance compared to peers, NI\u2019s projections compared to consensus, updated analysis including industry\ntrading statistics and data on select precedent transactions, including transactions in which Emerson was the\nacquirer. BofA reviewed with the Board an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, highlighting key changes from\nthe prior analysis presented to the Board in June 2022, and a summary valuation of NI. BofA Securities also provided\nan analysis of the two proposals in terms of implied equity value, implied enterprise value, implied multiples, a\npreliminary discounted cash flow analysis, and a preliminary valuation summary. The members of the Board then\ndiscussed with BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton the strategic review process they had undertaken, their\nassessment of the two proposals, and potential next steps in the strategic review process. The Board and its advisors\nalso discussed the value offered by the two proposals as compared to NI\u2019s standalone prospects. The Board and its\nadvisors believed that both Emerson and Party A could potentially offer additional value and improved contractual\nterms. Following this discussion, the Board determined that both parties should be invited to submit revised\nproposals. The Board instructed BofA Securities to tell Emerson and Party A that the Board was prepared to move\nquickly and that they should provide revised proposals by April 10.\nFollowing the meeting, BofA Securities contacted Emerson and Party A as directed by the Board and notified\neach party that it should submit a revised proposal, putting its best foot forward on value and deal certainty by\nMonday, April 10.

Emerson\u2019s updated\nproposal offered $57.75 per share in cash and submitted an updated draft merger agreement. Party A offered $58.50\nper share in cash (and, unlike Emerson\u2019s proposal, contained a covenant prohibiting NI from paying its regular\nquarterly dividend without Party A\u2019s consent). Party A also submitted a draft merger agreement which included a\nregulatory efforts commitment that imposed significantly lesser obligations than Emerson\u2019s and included several\nlimitations with respect to the level of divestiture and behavioral remedies Party A would commit to undertake in\norder to secure regulatory approval of an acquisition of NI by Party A.\nFollowing receipt of the updated proposals, on April 10, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with\nmembers of the Board, members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in\nattendance. Mr. Starkloff summarized the updated proposals for the TEC and the Board as well as his conversation\nwith the Chief Executive Officer of Party A over the weekend. Wachtell Lipton discussed the revised draft merger\nagreements submitted by Emerson and Party A with their updated proposals. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton\nalso explained that Party A\u2019s proposed merger agreement would not permit NI to pay a regular quarterly dividend\nduring the period between signing and closing of a transaction, while Emerson\u2019s draft merger agreement did allow NI\nto pay a regular quarterly dividend of $0.28. The members of the TEC and the Board and the others present discussed\nthe implication of the ability to pay the dividend or lack thereof on the value for stockholders in a potential\ntransaction with Emerson as compared to a potential transaction with Party A. The Board and its advisors continued\nto believe that, although Emerson and Party A had improved their offers since April 5, both Emerson and Party A\ncould potentially offer additional value and improved contractual terms and should be encouraged to submit \u201cbest\nand final\u201d proposals that further improved on their proposals of April 10. Following discussion, the members of the\nTEC and the Board instructed BofA Securities to notify Emerson and Party A that the Board was prepared to\npromptly transact with the party that could provide the most favorable proposal by the following day. Following the\nmeeting, BofA Securities contacted Emerson and Party A. BofA Securities expressed to both parties that they should\nsubmit revised proposals putting forward the maximum value they were prepared to offer to acquire NI, as well as\nhow each should improve its contractual terms, including telling Emerson that it should offer to pay a reverse\ntermination fee and telling Party A that it should improve its regulatory efforts commitment as had previously been\nexpressed to Party A and its counsel by BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton.\nOn the morning of April 11, 2023, Mr. Starkloff had calls with the Chief Executive Officer of each of Emerson and\nParty A and representatives of BofA Securities had a call with Party A\u2019s financial advisors, reiterating that the Board\nwas prepared to transact quickly and that they should submit their \u201cbest and final\u201d offer putting forward the\nmaximum price and best contractual terms they were prepared to offer.\nOn the afternoon of April 11, 2023, Emerson and Party A each submitted updated proposals to acquire NI.\nEmerson offered to acquire NI for $59.50 per share (permitting NI to pay its regular quarterly dividend) and Party A\noffered to acquire NI for $60.00 per share (and also now offered to permit NI to pay its regular quarterly dividend).\nEmerson\u2019s proposal continued to commit Emerson to take all requisite actions necessary to obtain regulatory\napprovals, offered to pay a reverse termination fee, and agreed to an 18-month outside date. Party A\u2019s proposal also\nincluded a reverse termination fee and an 18-month outside date, but continued to have significant limitations with\nrespect to the level of divestiture and behavioral remedies it would commit to undertake in order to obtain regulatory\napprovals. As Party A offered a slightly higher nominal price per share but continued to present less deal certainty, at\nthe instruction of the Chairman of the Board, and consistent with the Board\u2019s discussion at the prior day\u2019s meeting,\nBofA Securities held further conversations with Emerson and Party A, respectively, regarding whether Emerson could\nincrease its price further, and whether Party A would further improve its April 11 proposal with respect to the level of\ndivestiture and behavioral remedies. Party A stated that no improvement on those terms was forthcoming. Later in the\nafternoon of April 11, Emerson further raised its price, offering to acquire NI for $60.00 per share and submitted an\nupdated draft merger agreement, which included a reverse termination fee.\nLater in the afternoon on April 11, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of\nBofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff provided an update on the developments of the past\n24 hours, explaining that both parties in the strategic review process had improved their proposals to acquire NI. Mr.\nStarkloff, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton described in detail the interactions on behalf of NI with Emerson and\nParty A and their respective financial and legal advisors. BofA Securities described the financing commitments\nproposed by each party. Wachtell Lipton described the contractual terms\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noffered by each party, which were substantially the same on various key matters, including as to NI\u2019s ability to pay its\nregular quarterly dividend without the buyer\u2019s consent, the parties\u2019 debt financing commitment, fiduciary-out\nprovisions, and the size of the termination fee. Wachtell Lipton also discussed the key contractual terms related to\nregulatory approvals, including regulatory efforts, the reverse termination fee, regulatory conditions, and the end\ndate as well as regulatory deal certainty considerations for a transaction with each party. The Board discussed the\nrelative regulatory profiles of the two potential transactions and the commitments offered by each party, including\nthat the process for obtaining regulatory approval of a potential transaction with Emerson would likely be shorter and\nprovide greater certainty and fewer potential disruptions to NI\u2019s business than the process for obtaining regulatory\napproval of a potential transaction with Party A, in light of potential overlaps with Party A\u2019s business. The Board and\nWachtell Lipton discussed that, while Emerson was willing to commit to take all requisite actions necessary to obtain\nregulatory approvals, including making any and all divestitures or undertakings or behavioral commitments, Party A\u2019s\nproposed regulatory efforts commitment included meaningful limitations on behavioral remedies and divestitures.\nThe Board and Wachtell Lipton also discussed the circumstances in which the limitations to Party A\u2019s efforts\nobligations could lead to Party A not being obligated to close a transaction. Following discussion, the Board\ndetermined that an acquisition of NI by Emerson would provide higher deal certainty than a potential transaction with\nParty A and that such a transaction would be superior to remaining an independent company and in the best\ninterests of NI\u2019s stockholders. The Board authorized management and NI\u2019s advisors to negotiate the final transaction\ndetails and finalize all documentation for the transaction with Emerson. The Board determined to meet the following\nday to consider approving entry into a merger agreement with Emerson.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board, Mr. Starkloff called Mr. Karsanbhai to inform him that the Board had\ndetermined to finalize definitive agreements for an acquisition of NI by Emerson on the terms proposed.\nFollowing the call between Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai, Wachtell Lipton and DPW held several calls\nthroughout the night, including calls with representatives from NI and Emerson, to finalize the merger agreement and\nrelated documents ahead of an announcement in the morning.\nEarly on the morning of April 12, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of\nBofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities reviewed a brief timeline of events before and\nafter the launch of the strategic review process and a summary of the process. BofA Securities then presented its\nfinancial analyses and delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, that it\nwas the opinion of BofA Securities, based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in its written\nopinion, that the consideration of $60.00 per share in cash to be received in the proposed merger by holders of NI\u2019s\ncommon stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c- Opinion of BofA\nSecurities, Inc.\u201d Wachtell Lipton then described the terms of the proposed merger agreement, a summary of which\nhad been provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. Wachtell Lipton highlighted in particular certain terms\nthat had been agreed in the hours since the Board\u2019s last meeting and also discussed the amendment to the\nshareholder rights plan that would permit entry into a merger agreement with Emerson without triggering the rights\nplan. Wachtell Lipton also discussed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with the approval of a sale of NI for\ncash.

The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of NI\u2019s common stock,\nincluding the market performance of NI common stock relative to those of other publicly traded\n37TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompanies in NI\u2019s sector and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $60.00\nper share in cash represents a substantial premium to estimates of NI\u2019s unaffected stock price, including a\npremium of 49% to NI\u2019s unaffected stock price of $40.17 on January 12, 2023, the day prior to NI\u2019s\nannouncement of the strategic review process, and a 57% premium to NI\u2019s 30-day volume-weighted\naverage share price of $38.11 as of January 12, 2023.\n\u2022\nCertainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered that the proposed Merger Consideration is a fixed\ncash amount, providing NI stockholders with a certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the\nClosing of the Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing\nequivalent value from NI\u2019s standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives. In considering the\nMerger Consideration and comparing it against potential alternatives for NI, the Board of Directors\nleveraged its knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of\nNI, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which NI operates, including\nuncertain economic, market and capital raising conditions.\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement\nwere informed by the advice and professional experience of NI\u2019s advisors and were the result of robust\nnegotiations.\n\u2022\nOpinion of NI\u2019s Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presentation\nby NI\u2019s financial advisor, BofA Securities, and the oral opinion rendered to the Board, which was confirmed\nby delivery of a written opinion dated April 12, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the\nassumptions and limitations made, the $60.00 per share in cash to be paid to holders of shares of NI\ncommon stock (other than the Unconverted Shares) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement - Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\u201d The full text of the written opinion of BofA\nSecurities is attached to this proxy as Annex B.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions allowing the Board of Directors, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in\nresponse to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited alternative proposals made before NI\nstockholder approval of the Merger is obtained\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions allowing the Board of Directors to change its recommendation prior to obtaining\nstockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or\nIntervening Event, subject to Parent\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment\nof the termination fee of $310 million\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board of Directors to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a\nSuperior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $310\nmillion and certain rights of Parent to match the Superior Proposal)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the number and nature of the\nconditions to complete the Merger, and the provisions of the Merger Agreement requiring Parent to\nuse its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,\nall things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger including\nobtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, or approvals from third\nparties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement permits NI to continue to pay to NI stockholders regular quarterly\ndividends in an amount not to exceed a quarterly rate of $0.28 per share\u037e\n\u2022\nthe commitment by Parent (and its subsidiaries and affiliates) to use reasonable best efforts to obtain\nall necessary governmental approvals with respect to the Merger, including (i) agreeing to\ndivestitures, (ii) modifying contractual relationships and (iii) taking other actions that may limit\nParent\u2019s (and its subsidiaries\u2019 and affiliates\u2019) freedom of action with respect to or impose obligations\non their future operations or businesses, in each case as necessary to obtain any such approval and\nsubject to certain limitations described in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters,\u201d together with the fact that\nParent agreed to pay NI a $310 million termination fee under the circumstances described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Termination Fee Payable by\nParent\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.\n\u2022\nOpportunity for NI Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger would\nbe subject to the approval of NI stockholders, and NI stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger\nand vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\n\u2022\nTiming of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of\nthe Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly\nmanner. The Board of Directors also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable\ntimeframe could reduce the period during which NI\u2019s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty\nof closing and related disruption.\n\u2022\nLikelihood of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the absence of a financing condition or\nsimilar contingency based on Emerson\u2019s ability to obtain financing, Emerson\u2019s committed financing, and\nthe strong commitment made by Emerson to obtain regulatory approvals.\n\u2022\nOperating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides NI sufficient operating flexibility to\nconduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger\u201d).\n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. NI\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific\nperformance of Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other\nbreaches of the Merger Agreement.\nIn the course of their deliberations, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and other potentially\nadverse factors concerning the Merger, including:\n\u2022\nthe fact that completion of the transaction depends on certain factors outside of NI\u2019s control, including\nregulatory approvals and NI stockholder approval, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions\nto the transaction will be satisfied even if the Merger is approved by NI stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash transaction means that NI would no longer exist as an\nindependent public company following the consummation of the Merger and that NI stockholders will not\nparticipate in future earnings or growth of Emerson and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of\nthe Surviving Corporation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict NI\u2019s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or\nnegotiations regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions, and that restrict NI\nfrom entering into an alternative acquisition agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that NI could be required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay a termination fee\nof $310 million under certain circumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the\nMerger and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the Merger and related\ndisruptions to the operation of our business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential consequences of non-consummation of the transaction, including the potential negative\nimpacts on NI, its business and the trading price of its shares of common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that NI\u2019s remedies in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated may be limited to the\nParent Termination Fee of $310 million, payable by Parent under certain circumstances and certain\nassociated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to\ncompensate NI for any damage caused, and that such termination fee may not be available in all instances\nwhere the Merger is not consummated and, even if available, such rights and remedies may be expensive\nand difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain\u037e\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u2019s restrictions on the conduct of NI\u2019s business before completion of the Merger,\ngenerally requiring NI to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects\nin the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and prohibiting NI from taking certain\nspecified actions, which could delay or prevent NI from undertaking certain business opportunities that\narise pending completion of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nthe failure to complete the Merger, and/or actions that NI may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to\ntake under the Merger Agreement could have an adverse impact on our existing and prospective business\nrelationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees, including the risk that certain\nkey members of NI\u2019s management might choose not to remain employed with NI prior to the completion of\nthe Merger, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the exchange of NI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to NI\u2019s\nstockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nthat some of NI\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition\nto, the interests of NI stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-\nInterests of NI\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\u201d\u037e and\n\u2022\nother risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in NI\u2019s\nannual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, incorporated by reference herein\nand the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe Board of Directors concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the\nMerger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to\nbe exhaustive but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board of Directors. In view of\nthe wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the\nBoard of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nspecific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may\nhave given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific\ndetermination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not\nsupport its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the\ninformation presented, including the factors described above. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth\nabove is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\nNI has retained BofA Securities to act as NI\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the Merger.

The overall average and median\nLTM adjusted EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions were 23.4x and 20.8x, respectively, and the overall\naverage and median NTM adjusted EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions were 20.1x and 17.4x, respectively.\nBased on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities then applied LTM adjusted\nEBITDA and NTM adjusted EBITDA multiples of 14.5x to 22.0x and 13.0x to 17.5x, respectively, derived from the\nprimary selected precedent transactions to NI\u2019s LTM adjusted EBITDA and NTM adjusted EBITDA of $424 million\nand $625 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023 to determine indicative per share equity values. Estimated\nfinancial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement\nof the relevant transaction. Estimated financial data of NI were based on the NI management forecasts.

Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business\nsegments or transactions to which NI and the Merger were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of NI to calculate\nthe estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that NI was forecasted to generate\nduring the second through fourth quarters of calendar year 2023 and calendar years ending December 31, 2024\nthrough 2028 based on the NI management forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for NI by applying\nperpetuity growth rates of 3.0% to 3.50%, based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience, to NI\u2019s\nestimated calendar year 2028 normalized unlevered free cash flow. The cash flows and terminal values were then\ndiscounted to present value as of March 31, 2023, assuming a mid-year convention for cash flows, using discount\nrates ranging from 8.75% to 10.75%, which were based on an estimate of NI\u2019s weighted average cost of capital\nderived using the capital asset pricing model. From the resulting enterprise values, BofA Securities subtracted net\ndebt as of March 31, 2023 of $380 million to derive equity values. This analysis indicated the following approximate\nimplied per share equity value reference ranges for NI (rounded to the nearest $0.25) as compared to the Merger\nConsideration:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value \nReference Range for NI\nMerger Consideration\n$52.50 - $77.50\n$60.00\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 material\nfinancial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other\nthings, the following:\n\u2022\nthe historical trading range of NI common stock during the 12-month period ended April 10, 2023, which\nwas $31.02 to $42.91 per share\u037e\n\u2022\npublicly available equity research analyst price targets for NI common stock available as of January 12,\n2023, which had a price target range (discounted one year by a 9.9% cost of equity) of $39.12 to $47.31 per\nshare\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe premiums paid in selected all-cash control acquisitions of publicly traded U.S. companies with\ntransaction values greater than $1 billion since 2012. For each of the transactions, BofA Securities\ncalculated the premium represented by the offer price over the target company\u2019s 52-week high share price\nand over the target company\u2019s unaffected share price, meaning the closing share price one day prior to the\nearliest of (i) the announcement of the transaction, (ii) the target company\u2019s announcement of a potential\ntransaction or that it is exploring strategic alternatives, (iii) the first reported rumor regarding the\ntransaction, and (iv) any other public indication that a sale transaction would likely take place (which\nearliest date is referred to as the \u201cunaffected date\u201d). Based on this review and its professional judgment\nand experience, BofA Securities applied an illustrative range of premiums derived by reference to the 25th\nand 75th percentile of the observed premiums to the unaffected share price of NI common stock on January\n12, 2023 of $40.17, to derive implied equity value reference ranges per share of $49.35 to $61.40.\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by\nBofA Securities to the Board of Directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all\nanalyses undertaken by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a\ncomplex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of\nfinancial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial\nopinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its\nanalyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions\nof its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater\nweight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of NI. The estimates of the future performance of\nNI in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities\u2019\nanalyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided to the Board of Directors in connection with the\ndelivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a\ncompany might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the\nfuture. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis\ndescribed above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019\nview of the actual values of NI or its shares.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between NI\nand Emerson, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board of Directors. The decision to enter\ninto the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion\nand analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the proposed\nMerger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or management with\nrespect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.\nNI has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee currently\nestimated to be approximately $51 million, a portion of which was payable in connection with its opinion and a\nsignificant portion of which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger. NI also has agreed to reimburse BofA\nSecurities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA\nSecurities, any of its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other\nperson controlling BofA Securities or any of its affiliates against specified liabilities.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal\ninvesting as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,\nfinancing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a\nprincipal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance\npositions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of NI, Emerson and certain of their respective affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may\nprovide investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to NI, and have received or in the future\nmay receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as a bookrunner,\narranger and/or syndication agent for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, letters of credit, credit facilities and\nother credit arrangements of NI and/or certain of its affiliates, (ii) having provided or providing certain trading\nservices to NI and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury and payment\nmanagement products and services to NI and/or certain of its affiliates. From March 1, 2021 through February 28,\n2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from NI and its affiliates of approximately $2\nmillion for investment and corporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future\nmay provide investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Emerson and/or certain of its\naffiliates, and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including\n(i) having acted or acting as a bookrunner, book-running manager and/or underwriter for certain debt and commercial\npaper offerings of Emerson, (ii) having acted or acting as a bookrunner, arranger and/or syndication agent for, and/or\nas a lender under, certain term loans, letters of credit, leasing and other credit arrangements of Emerson and/or certain\nof its affiliates, (iii) having provided or providing certain trading and foreign exchange services to Emerson and/or\ncertain of its affiliates, and (iv) having provided or providing\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncertain treasury, payment and liquidity management products and services to Emerson and/or certain of its affiliates.\nFrom March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from\nEmerson and its affiliates of approximately $10 million for investment and corporate banking services.",

        "Section Text": "Certain Financial Projections\nWhile NI has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, NI does not, as a matter of\ncourse, otherwise publicly disclose internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or other results beyond\nthe then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial\nperformance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of underlying assumptions and\nestimates. However, in the ordinary course, NI management prepares a long-term strategic plan, which is periodically\nupdated and reviewed with the Board, that reflects NI management\u2019s financial and business outlook for NI. In\nconnection with the proposed Merger, NI is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited\nprospective financial information of NI, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by NI\nmanagement, solely because, as described below, certain financial information was given to the Board in connection\nwith its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to BofA Securities for its use and reliance in connection with\nthe financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board and BofA Securities\u2019 opinion as discussed in \u201c-\nOpinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\u201d\nIn June 2022, in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of Emerson\u2019s initial proposal to acquire NI, NI\nmanagement prepared certain unaudited, preliminary financial forecasts for NI for fiscal years 2022 through 2025,\nwhich NI management also extrapolated through fiscal year 2028 (the \u201cJune 2022 Projections\u201d) in connection with\nBofA Securities\u2019 preliminary financial analysis of Emerson\u2019s initial proposal.\nIn December 2022, in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of Emerson\u2019s updated proposal and consideration\nof initiating a strategic review process, NI management updated the projections and extrapolations to take into\naccount changes in the internal and external business environment, including updates to NI\u2019s component supply\nchain and general economic environment as well as efficiency savings in operating expense (the \u201cDecember 2022\nProjections\u201d).\nIn February 2023, NI management made updates to the projections and extrapolations in the December 2022\nProjections related to depreciation and amortization and taxes (the \u201cFebruary 2023 Projections\u201d). The Board reviewed\nthe February 2023 Projections and BofA Securities used the February 2023 Projections in connection with the Board\u2019s\nevaluation and BofA Securities\u2019 financial analysis of the updated proposals to acquire NI, including Emerson\u2019s final\nproposal to acquire NI. The February 2023 Projections (but not the unlevered free cash flow) were also made available\nto participants in the strategic review process in connection with the management presentations.\nThe June 2022 Projections, the December 2022 Projections, and the February 2023 Projections are referred to\ncollectively as the \u201cCompany Projections.\u201d NI is including a summary of the Company Projections to provide NI\nstockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the\nMerger and the Merger Consideration.\nJune 2022 Projections\nNI management prepared the June 2022 Projections with respect to NI\u2019s business, as a standalone company, for\nthe second through fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2028, except that, at the direction of NI\nmanagement, unlevered free cash flow was arithmetically calculated by BofA Securities solely using the prospective\nfinancial information included in the June 2022 Projections, which calculation was reviewed and approved by NI\nmanagement for BofA Securities\u2019 reliance and use in connection with the preliminary financial analysis presented by\nBofA Securities to the Board at the June 14, 2022 meeting.\nThe following table summarizes the June 2022 Projections, with dollars in millions, except per share values:\n \nFiscal Years\n

the Company Projections or of this summary does not constitute an admission or\nrepresentation by NI, BofA Securities, or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as\nan indication that the Board, BofA Securities, NI or its management, or any other recipient of this information\nconsidered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of\nfuture results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as\nindicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on\nthe Company Projections.\nThe Company Projections include non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted\nDiluted Earnings Per Share and Unlevered Free Cash Flow. Please see the tables above for a description of how NI\ndefines these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of the Company Projections in this section. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented\nin accordance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures used by NI may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies.\nThe Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were based\nare subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the\ndynamics of NI\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and business developments. The Company Projections,\nwhile presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Company performance,\nindustry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters,\nmany of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond NI\u2019s\ncontrol. The Company Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements,\u201d that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and\nfor actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance that the\nCompany Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and\nthe Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon\nas such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable\nwith each successive year. The Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring\nafter the date on which they were prepared, including the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been\nmade in connection with the preparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company\nProjections were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an\nadditional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be\nachieved.\nIn addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the\ndate the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of NI, Emerson or any of\nour or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise\nthe Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when\nmade or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to\nbe in error (except, in the case of NI, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken\ninto account in reviewing the Company Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the Special Meeting will be held several months after the\nCompany Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of\nthis proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company Projections set forth below.\nThe Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and\nother information contained in NI\u2019s public filings with the SEC. NI urges all of its stockholders to\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreview its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or\ntoward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of\nthe SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and\npresentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cErnst & Young\u201d), NI\u2019s independent\nregistered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed any\nprocedures with respect to the Company Projections and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young nor any other\naccounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young report\nincorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to NI\u2019s historical financial information. It does not extend to\nthe prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.\nNone of NI or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any\nrepresentation to any NI stockholder or to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning\nthe Company Projections or regarding NI\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the\nCompany Projections or that the projected results will be achieved.\nInterests of NI\u2019s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that NI stockholders approve the transaction and\nvote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, NI\nstockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of NI have certain interests in the transactions\nthat are or may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of NI stockholders generally. The Board of Directors\nwas aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that NI stockholders\nadopt the Merger Agreement.\nThese interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative below,\nincluding compensation that may become payable in connection with the Merger to NI\u2019s named executive officers\n(which is the subject of an advisory (nonbinding) vote of NI stockholders). For more information, please see the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 2: The Compensation Proposal.\u201d The dates used below to quantify\nthese interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only in accordance with SEC rules and do not necessarily\nreflect the dates on which certain events will occur.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, NI\u2019s named executive officers are:\n\u2022\nEric H. Starkloff - President and Chief Executive Officer\n\u2022\nDaniel Berenbaum - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\u2022\nScott A. Rust - Executive Vice President, Global Operations\n\u2022\nRitu Favre - Executive Vice President & GM, Business Units\n\u2022\nKaren M. Rapp - Former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\u2022\nJason E. Green - Former Executive Vice President & GM, Portfolio BU and Chief Revenue Officer \nFor purposes of this disclosure, NI\u2019s executive officers consist of its named executive officers and Thomas\nBenjamin (Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Platform and Product Analytics).\nTreatment of NI Equity Awards\nAt the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and\nthat is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service\nprovider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive\n(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger\nConsideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company RSU as of\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time. Each other Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the\nEffective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms and conditions as applied to\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Emerson common stock\nunderlying the Emerson RSU equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of\nNI common stock underlying the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Equity Award\nExchange Ratio.\nAt the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and\nthat is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service\nprovider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive\n(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger\nConsideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company PSU as of\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming that performance was achieved at the target level if the applicable\nperformance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time). Each other Company PSU that is\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms\nand conditions as applied to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any performance-\nbased vesting conditions), with the number of shares of Emerson common stock underlying the Emerson RSU equal\nto the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of NI common stock underlying the\nCompany PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming that performance was achieved at the target level if\nthe applicable performance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time) and (b) the Equity Award\nExchange Ratio.\nUnder NI\u2019s equity incentive plans (other than the 2010 Incentive Plan), the vesting of awards assumed or\nsubstituted by an acquirer in a change in control would accelerate in full if the holder\u2019s employment was terminated\nwithout cause within 24 months following the change in control (i.e., double-trigger). Under NI\u2019s 2010 Incentive Plan,\nthe vesting of outstanding awards would be immediately accelerated upon a change in control (i.e., single-trigger).\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, NI may amend the terms of any equity awards that do not vest upon the Effective\nTime to provide that such awards will fully vest upon the holder\u2019s termination of employment without cause, for good\nreason or due to death or disability, in each case generally within 24 months following the Effective Time (i.e., double-\ntrigger).\nFor an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on\nMay 10, 2023, and each of the named executive officers experiences a termination without cause on that date, see \u201c-\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to NI\u2019s Named Executive Officers\u201d below. We estimate that the value of\nunvested equity awards held by Mr. Benjamin that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10,\n2023 and that he experiences a termination without cause on that date is $3,571,020, calculated based on the Merger\nConsideration of $60 per share. We estimate that the aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-\nemployee directors of NI that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10, 2023 is $1,561,980,\ncalculated based on the Merger Consideration of $60 per share.\nExecutive Employment Agreements\nNI is party to an employment agreement with each of its executive officers (other than Ms. Rapp and Mr. Green).\nEffective January 9, 2023, Mr. Berenbaum replaced Ms. Rapp as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,\nand Ms. Rapp transitioned to a strategic advisor role pursuant to a continued employment offer letter that does not\nprovide any severance payments or benefits. Mr. Green, former Executive Vice President & GM, Portfolio BU and\nChief Revenue Officer, departed NI effective December 31, 2022.\nUnder the employment agreements, in the event of a termination without cause or for good reason within 3\nmonths prior to or 12 months following a change in control, the executive generally would be entitled to the following\nseverance benefits: (a) 1x (or 1.5x in the case of Mr. Starkloff) the executive\u2019s annual base salary, paid in a lump-sum\non the 60th day following termination\u037e (b) 100% of the executive\u2019s annual bonus then in effect (to the extent not\nalready earned and accrued), paid when annual bonuses are paid to other NI senior executives\u037e (c) accelerated\nvesting of outstanding service-based restricted stock unit awards that would have vested had the executive remained\nemployed for 12 months following termination (equity awards also would be subject to the double-trigger change-in-\ncontrol vesting provisions under the applicable equity plan as described above)\u037e and (d) reimbursement or payment\nof COBRA premiums (at the coverage level in effect immediately prior to the executive\u2019s termination) for 12 months (or\n18 months in the case of Mr. Starkloff) following termination or until the executive becomes covered under similar\nplans, if earlier. The foregoing severance payments and benefits are generally subject to the executive\u2019s execution\nand nonrevocation of a release of claims and compliance with NI\u2019s proprietary rights agreement containing restrictive\ncovenants.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to\nNI\u2019s named executive officers assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10, 2023 and that the executive\nexperiences a termination without cause on that date, see \u201c- Quantification of Payments and Benefits to NI\u2019s Named\nExecutive Officers\u201d below. We estimate that the value of severance payments and benefits (other than equity awards,\nwhich are quantified separately) that would be payable to Mr. Benjamin, assuming that the Effective Time occurs on\nMay 10, 2023 and that the executive experiences a termination without cause on that date, is $850,000 in cash\nseverance and $20,000 in reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums.\nSection 280G and 4999 of the Code\nPursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with each of our executive officers (other than Ms. Rapp\nand Mr. Green, who are not party to such agreements), if payments to an executive under his or her employment\nagreement (or otherwise) would be subject to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (as defined in the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201c- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d), such payments would\nbe reduced to the extent the executive would be better off after taxes.\nTo the extent the Effective Time is not reasonably expected to occur in 2023, in consultation with Parent, NI may\ntake any of the following actions in order to mitigate the effects, if any, of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code: (i)\naccelerate the vesting and payment into 2023 of (A) 2023 annual bonuses and (B) unvested equity awards which are\nscheduled to vest in the first half of 2024, (ii) accelerate the vesting or payment of compensation that would vest or\nbecome payable at the Effective Time, (iii) enter into non-competition agreements or (iv) pay out accrued vacation in\n2023. Any amounts accelerated will be subject to repayment in the event the executive does not meet the applicable\noriginal vesting conditions with respect to such amounts.\nRetention Awards\nIn connection with the Merger, Mr. Berenbaum has been granted a cash retention award in the amount of\n$100,000, which is payable, subject to continued service, 50% upon the Effective Time and 50% on the first\nanniversary of the Effective Time (or, in the case of the second installment, upon an earlier termination of employment\nwithout cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, subject to the recipient\u2019s execution and nonrevocation of\na release of claims).\nAnnual Bonus for Year of Closing\nIf the Effective Time occurs in 2023 or following March 1, 2024, Parent will pay to each eligible NI employee\n(including each executive officer) an annual bonus in respect of the year of Closing at the same time NI historically\npaid annual bonuses, based on (x) the greater of 75% of target performance and actual performance (as determined by\nNI) in respect of the period elapsed in such year prior to the Effective Time and (y) actual performance (as determined\nby Parent) in respect of the period remaining in such year following the Effective Time, subject to the applicable\nemployee\u2019s continued employment through the payment date or upon his or her earlier termination of employment\nafter the Closing without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability (if termination occurs in the year of\nClosing, the amount will be prorated based on the number of days elapsed in the year through such termination).\nIndemnification Insurance\nNI\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period\nof six years following the effective time under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving\nCorporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement - Indemnification and Insurance.\u201d\nNew Compensation Arrangements\nAny executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained\nto provide services to the Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and\nmay participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent, any of its affiliates or the\nSurviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation arrangements between such persons\nand the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been established or discussed.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to NI\u2019s Named Executive Officers\nThe table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of NI\u2019s named executive officers\nwould receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named\nexecutive officer experienced a termination without cause on May 10, 2023 (which is the assumed date of the\nconsummation of the Merger solely for purposes of this disclosure)\u037e and (ii) a per share price of NI common stock of\n$60, which is the per share merger consideration. The calculations in the table below do not attempt to forecast any\nadjustments in compensation that may occur following the date of this proxy statement, including additional awards,\ngrants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of\nthe Merger prior to the Effective Time. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur\nor be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual\namounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\nName\nCash \n($)(1)\nEquity \n($)(2)\nPerquisites\n/Benefits \n($)(3)\nOther \n($)(4)\nTotal \n($)\nNamed Executive Officers\n \n \n \n \n \nEric H.

While the cash severance payment is paid as a lump sum in the\nevent the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment during the 3 months prior to or the 12\nmonths following the Merger, the named executive officers remain eligible pursuant to their employment agreements to receive\nthese same cash benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment outside such window, in which case, the cash component\nwill be paid in installments over the 12-month (or 18-month period in the case of Mr. Starkloff) following termination of\nemployment, and the annual bonus will be paid when bonuses are normally paid to senior executives of NI.

At the request of NI in order to provide certainty\nof funds for the Merger, Parent has entered into a commitment letter (the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d), dated as of April 12,\n2023, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (collectively, the \u201cCommitment\nParties\u201d), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge\nloan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $8.175 billion (the \u201cBridge Facility\u201d), to fund the consideration\nfor the Merger. The Bridge Facility is subject to customary reduction and prepayment terms, including reduction or\nprepayment with the Climate Proceeds. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter is\ncontingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i) the execution and delivery of definitive\ndocumentation with respect to the Bridge Facility and (ii) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the\nMerger Agreement.\nParent agrees to keep the Commitment Letter in place unless Parent receives the proceeds from the Climate\nTransaction (or the bridge commitments are otherwise terminated pursuant to the mandatory reduction terms of the\nCommitment Letter). In the event that the bridge commitments will be taken out by a term loan (in lieu of the Climate\nProceeds), Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to sign a credit agreement with respect to the term loan\ntakeout as promptly as possible after the Syndication Commencement Date (as defined in the Commitment Letter as\nof the date of the Merger Agreement), which will be the earlier of (x) June 12, 2023 and (y) a date notified to Parent in\nwriting by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and receipt of the Financing Information (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nIf any such credit agreements are signed, Parent will be required to deliver those documents to NI.",

The\nfollowing discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or\ncost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that you exercise your appraisal rights under Section 262.\nAny person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of\nSection 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262), particularly the procedural steps required to properly\ndemand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and perfecting\nappraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to\na (i) \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of NI common stock, (ii) \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d are to a person who is the\nbeneficial owner of shares of NI common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person,\nand (iii) \u201cperson\u201d are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.\nUnder Section 262, stockholders and beneficial owners desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1)\nproperly deliver a written demand for an appraisal of their shares of NI common stock to NI prior to the stockholder\nvote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (3) hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of NI common stock upon the\nmaking of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, such shares of NI\ncommon stock through the Effective Time\u037e (4) not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or\notherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (5) otherwise meet the criteria\nand follow the procedures set forth in Section 262. However, assuming the shares of NI common stock remain listed\non a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal\npetition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders and\nbeneficial owners of NI common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of\nshares of NI common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of NI common stock eligible\nfor appraisal or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of\nsuch total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cMinimum Conditions.\u201d\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest\nfrom the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly\nand shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to\ntime during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e provided,\nhowever, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the\nSurviving Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such\ninterest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and\n(2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons\nconsidering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section\n262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the stockholders\n55TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwho was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are\navailable that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing the\nstockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription\nor cost. This proxy statement constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nMerger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online\n(available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In connection with the Merger, any\nperson who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such person\u2019s right to do so should review\nSection 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result\nin the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to\nreceive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to\nseek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of\nlegal counsel.\nStockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of NI\ncommon stock must strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial\nowner or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination\nof the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is\nunder no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights\nshould not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not\nvote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding\nmethods of voting.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s\nshares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for\nappraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s\nfailure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the\nSpecial Meeting may constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nRecord Holders\nA demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must\nreasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal\nof the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If a holder of record is submitting a demand with respect\nto shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record\nby more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on\nbehalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or\nowners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or\nowners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of NI common\nstock as nominee or intermediary for one or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to\nshares of NI common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other\nbeneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of NI common stock as to\nwhich appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of NI common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will\nbe presumed to cover all shares of NI common stock held in the name of the holder of record.\nBeneficial Owners\nA beneficial owner may, in such person\u2019s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner\u2019s shares\nin accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such\nbeneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrequirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand\nmade by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made,\nis accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement\nthat such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by NI under Section 262 and to be set forth on the\nVerified List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Actions After Completion of the Merger\u201d).\nAlthough not expressly required by Section 262, NI reserves the right to take the position that it may require the\nsubmission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 with respect to\nany person sharing beneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted. All written demands for\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: Secretary, National Instruments Corporation,\n11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic\ntransmission.\nActions After Completion of the Merger\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each\nholder of NI common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not\nvoted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded\nappraisal as of the Effective Time, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand\nfor appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to us as the Surviving\nCorporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving\nCorporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262,\nmay commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on\nthe Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all our stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and no person should assume that\nthe Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of\nNI common stock. Accordingly, any stockholders or beneficial owners who desire to have their shares appraised\nshould initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of NI common stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of\nshares of NI common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could result in the loss of\nappraisal rights. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the requirements for\nexercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or\nbeneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his,\nher or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such\nshares for purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the\nrequesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or\nwithin 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of NI common stock or a beneficial owner\nand a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within\n20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the\n\u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and\nwith whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be\nmailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated\ntherein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nand the costs of these notices shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to\nconduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 and who have\nbecome entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons who\ndemanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation\nthereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.\nIn addition, assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior\nto the Effective Time, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are\notherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the Minimum Conditions is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of NI common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to\nbe the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving\nCorporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which\ninterest accrues as described above).\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of NI common stock as\nso determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger\nConsideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of NI common\nstock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner\naddress, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration offered\npursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights should recognize\nthat such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger\nConsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither NI nor Parent anticipates offering more than the\nMerger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or beneficial owner of shares of NI\ncommon stock exercising appraisal rights, and NI and Parent each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash payment\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes\nof Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of NI common stock is less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed,\nneither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately prior to the Effective Time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek\nappraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if\nany, by the Surviving Corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon\nsuch terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree\nmay be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the\nVerified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019\nfees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal\nnot dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of\njurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of NI common stock under Section 262 fails to\nperfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of NI common\nstock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration\noffered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or\nwithdraw, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time,\nneither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately prior to the Effective Time) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of\nsuch person\u2019s shares of NI common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment\nof dividends or other distributions on such shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the Minimum\nConditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior\nto the Effective Time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the Surviving Corporation a\nwritten withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person\u2019s shares within 60 days\nafter the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262, then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares\nwill cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, no appraisal\nproceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without\nlimitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection\n(j) of Section 262\u037e provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand in respect of\nsome or all of such person\u2019s shares and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger with respect to the shares\nsubject to the withdrawal within 60 days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a\nstockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner\nwishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger\nthat may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of shares of NI common stock whose shares of NI common\nstock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders\nwho hold their shares of NI common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the United States\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the \u201cCode\u201d) (generally, property held for\ninvestment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other\nthan U.S. Holders. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,\nrulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial\ndecisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect\nthe accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS\nwould not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in\nthis discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has been or\nwill be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of NI common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the\nlaws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration\nof such trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority\nto control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of\nthe U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts\nand circumstances, or to NI stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for\nexample:\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n\u2022\ntraders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to shares of NI\ncommon stock\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations\nand pension funds\u037e\n60TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nholders that hold shares of NI common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or other\nintegrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS\ncorporations,\u201d or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such\nentities)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of NI common stock (by\nvote or value)\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of NI common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-\nqualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nholders subject to any applicable minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\nholders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL\u037e and\n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to NI common\nstock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income\ntax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income\ntax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned\nincome Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or any\nconsiderations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations\nand administrative guidance promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant\nthereto or in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such\nagreement).\nIf any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of\nshares of NI common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will\ndepend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations\nmade at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships holding shares of NI common\nstock, and any partners therein, should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the\nMerger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR NI STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE NI STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX\nCIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX\nCONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,\nINCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of NI common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.\nHolder who receives cash in exchange for NI common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the shares of NI common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of NI common stock. Any gain or\nloss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than\none year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,\nincluding individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of NI common stock at different times or\ndifferent prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to\neach block of NI common stock.\n61\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in\nconnection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S.\nHolder pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly\ncompleted and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and\ncertifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and\notherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S.\nHolder may be refunded or credited against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that\nthe required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX\nCONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY\nSTATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF\nTHEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nEach of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement) use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, and to do\npromptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,\nproper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals, registrations,\nwaivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from governmental entities as described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.\u201d\nThese approvals include clearances under the HSR Act and regulatory approvals under the laws of certain other\njurisdictions.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger\nunder HSR Act has expired or been terminated and any and all agreements with governmental entities with competent\njurisdiction over NI or Parent pursuant to which such parties have agreed not to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement until a specified time has expired, been terminated or been waived. A\ntransaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or termination of a 30-day waiting\nperiod following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission\n(which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the\n\u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a \u201cSecond\nRequest\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting\nperiod, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless\nthe waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. The parties made\nthe required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on April 26, 2023.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the\nwaiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could\ntake such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nPrivate parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be\ncertain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Regulatory Clearances\nThe Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions (unless\nexcluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties to the Merger Agreement) under their applicable regulatory\nlaws as amended from time to time.\nIn each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the\nMerger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with\neach other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings as promptly as practicable. The relevant\nregulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or\ndesirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold\nseparate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock entitled to vote\nthereon is required for approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal.\nAssuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting, (b)\nabstentions and (c) \u201cbroker non-votes\u201d (if any) will each have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nAgreement Proposal. Shares of NI common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked\nproxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an NI stockholder returns a signed\nproxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of NI common stock represented by\nthat proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting,\nand all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",
