A quorum of\nstockholders is necessary to conduct business at a special meeting. The holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding GCP common stock\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. As a\nresult, 36,967,903 shares of GCP common stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors\nto have a quorum. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting may result in an adjournment of the special meeting and may subject\nus to additional expense.\nRequired Vote\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock outstanding as of the\nRecord Date and entitled to vote on the matter. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of\nthe shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Approval of the Compensation\nProposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and\nentitled to vote on the matter.\nStock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons\nAs of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 419,806 shares of GCP\ncommon stock (excluding any shares that would be delivered upon exercise or conversion, as applicable, of GCP stock options or GCP restricted\nstock units and excluding shares beneficially owned by Starboard Value LP and certain of its affiliates (\u201cStarboard\u201d)), representing approximately\n0.6% of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of\ntheir shares of GCP common stock: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation\nProposal.\nAs of the Record Date, Starboard and certain affiliates of Standard Investments (formerly known as 40 North) and Standard Industries (collectively,\n\u201cStandard\u201d) beneficially owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of 6,540,000 and 17,778,352 shares of GCP common stock, respectively,\nrepresenting approximately 8.8% and 24.0% of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock, respectively. Per the voting agreements entered into\nbetween Starboard and Standard, respectively, and Parent, Merger Sub and the persons named therein, Starboard and Standard have agreed to vote:\n(i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e and (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\n3\nTable of Contents\nVoting of Proxies\nAny GCP stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by Internet, telephone or\nmail or may attend the special meeting and vote in person. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of GCP common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nthrough a broker, bank or nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock\nusing the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the\ndiscretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to\nsuch matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers, banks and nominees therefore cannot vote on these\nproposals without your instructions. Generally, if a broker exercises its discretion on routine matters at a stockholder meeting, a stockholder\u2019s shares\nwill be voted on the routine matter in the manner directed by the broker, but will constitute a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d on all of the non-routine matters to\nbe presented at the stockholder meeting. Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if you hold your\nshares in street name through a brokerage account, your broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on any of the\nproposals presented at the special meeting. As a result, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. Therefore, it is important that\nyou instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock or that you obtain from such broker, bank or\nnominee a valid legal proxy issued in your name and vote in person at the special meeting.\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by signing\nanother proxy card with a later date and returning it to us before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before the special meeting, by providing written\nnotice of revocation to our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary before your proxy is exercised, by submitting a new proxy card\nelectronically over the Internet or telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in person.\nSee the instructions set forth in \u201cRevocability of Proxies\u201d on page 26 of this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet\nname,\u201d you should contact your broker, bank or nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card or to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect\nas a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on the Merger\nProposal, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal, but assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation\nProposal. Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if you hold your shares in street name through\na brokerage account, your broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on any of the proposals presented at the\nspecial meeting and, as a result, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal.\nNeither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described in this proxy statement,\nincluding the Merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of such transactions, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this\nproxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\nExpenses of Proxy Solicitation (page 27)\nOur board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) is soliciting your proxy, and GCP will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. We have engaged the services of Okapi\nPartners LLC (\u201cOkapi\u201d) to solicit proxies for the special meeting. In connection with its retention, Okapi has agreed to provide consulting, analytic\nand proxy solicitation\n4\nTable of Contents\nservices in connection with the special meeting. We have agreed to pay Okapi a fee of approximately $21,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket\nexpenses, for its services, and we will indemnify Okapi for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services. In addition to the solicitation of\nproxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, or representatives of Okapi, in person or by telephone, email, fax\nor other means of communication, and we may pay persons holding shares of GCP common stock on behalf of others their expenses for sending\nproxy materials to their principals. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for their services in connection\nwith solicitation of proxies.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on GCP (page 33)\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into GCP, with GCP continuing as the\nsurviving corporation (the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d) and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, GCP will cease to be a\npublicly traded company and will cease to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any\nshares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Merger Consideration\u201d on page 34 of this proxy statement (except that if you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal for\nyour shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as\namended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), you will be entitled only to those rights granted under Section 262 of the DGCL as described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal\nRights\u201d on page 69 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).\nThe effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such\nlater time as we and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger) (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d).\nEffect on GCP if the Merger is Not Completed (page 33)\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by the stockholders of GCP or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any\npayment for your shares of GCP common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, GCP common stock will continue to be listed and traded on\nthe NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and we will continue to be obligated to file\nperiodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a\ntermination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u201d on page 104 of this\nproxy statement.\nMerger Consideration (page 34)\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding share of GCP common stock (other than (i) shares held by GCP as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger\nSub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of GCP, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) shares of common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to and\nhave properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cDissenting\nShares\u201d)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $32.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the\n\u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). All shares of GCP common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be\ncancelled and cease to exist at the Effective Time, and each certificate formerly representing such shares will thereafter represent only the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration. Following the completion of the Merger, GCP will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.\nAs described further in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Exchange and Payment Procedures\u201d on page 85 of this proxy statement, substantially currently\nwith the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited with the paying agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger\nConsideration. Following the completion of\n5\nTable of Contents\nthe Merger, after a stockholder has provided the paying agent with such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates and a letter of transmittal, the paying agent\nwill promptly pay the stockholder the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled. Stockholders who hold shares of GCP common\nstock in book-entry form (other than shares held through The Depository Trust Company) will not be required to deliver stock certificates to the\npaying agent to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled. Holders of shares of GCP common stock in book-entry form who hold\nsuch shares through The Depository Trust Company will not be required to deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive\nthe Merger Consideration to which they are entitled.\nAfter the completion of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but\nyou will no longer have any rights as a GCP stockholder (except that stockholders who hold Dissenting Shares will not have the right to receive\nthe Merger Consideration but will instead have the right to receive a payment for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their Dissenting Shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal\nRights\u201d on page 69 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).\nTreatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 60)\nAt the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of GCP common stock (each, a \u201cCompany Option\u201d), whether vested or unvested, that is\noutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, automatically without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company,\nbe cancelled and entitle the holder thereof to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of\nGCP common stock subject to the Company Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price\nof such Company Option\u037e provided, that any Company Option with respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the\nMerger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding award of GCP restricted stock (\u201cCompany Restricted Stock\u201d) and each outstanding award of GCP restricted\nstock units (\u201cCompany RSUs\u201d), that in each case at such time is vested (including restricted stock units under the Company\u2019s Non-Employee\nDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Program) or subject solely to service-based vesting conditions will become fully vested and will, automatically\nwithout any required action on the part of the holder or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an\namount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares underlying such award of Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs, as applicable,\nmultiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.\nAt the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company performance based stock units (a \u201cCompany PBU\u201d) that is subject to performance-based\nvesting conditions will become vested as to the greater of the number of Shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (1) the\ntarget level of achievement and (2) the Company\u2019s actual level of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement\nas of the Effective Time, as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee prior to the closing of the Merger, and will, after giving effect to\nsuch vesting, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right\nto receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of vested Shares underlying such Company PBUs, multiplied by (y) the\nMerger Consideration. Any outstanding Company PBUs (or portion thereof) that are not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be\ncanceled for no consideration.\n6\nTable of Contents\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 47)\nThe Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and considering various factors described in\n\u201cThe Merger\u2014Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\u201d on page 47 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i)\napproved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger\u037e (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the Voting\nAgreements are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders\u037e (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the\nstockholders of GCP for its adoption at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) recommended that GCP\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board recommends that you vote: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation\nProposal.\nOpinion of RBC Capital Markets, LLC (page 51)\nGCP retained RBC Capital Markets, LLC (\u201cRBCCM\u201d) to provide its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of GCP\ncommon stock of the Merger Consideration provided for pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nRBCCM rendered an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 5, 2021, to the Board to the\neffect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth\ntherein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of GCP common stock.\nRBCCM\u2019s advice (written or oral) and opinion were provided for the benefit, information and assistance of the Board (in its capacity as such) in\nconnection with its evaluation of the Merger. RBCCM\u2019s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of GCP to engage in the Merger or\nthe relative merits of the Merger compared to any alternative business strategy or transaction that may be available to GCP or in which GCP might\nengage. RBCCM\u2019s opinion does not constitute an opinion or recommendation to any holder of GCP common stock as to how such holder should\nvote or act with respect to the Merger or any proposal to be voted upon in connection with the Merger or otherwise.\nThe full text of RBCCM\u2019s written opinion, dated December 5, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C, and constitutes part of this\nproxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and\nqualifications of the review undertaken by RBCCM in rendering its opinion. GCP urges holders of GCP common stock to read RBCCM\u2019s opinion\ncarefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the\nreview undertaken by RBCCM.\nFor a further discussion of RBCCM\u2019s opinion, GCP\u2019s relationship with RBCCM and the terms of RBCCM\u2019s engagement, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion\nof RBC Capital Markets, LLC\u201d beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement.\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger (page 60)\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that certain of our directors\nand executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was\naware of these interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement\nbe adopted by the stockholders of GCP. These interests include the following:\n\u25cf\nExecutive Severance Agreements with GCP. Our executive officers are covered by agreements or arrangements under which they are\neligible for severance benefits upon the qualifying termination of\n7\nTable of Contents\nthe executive officer\u2019s employment without \u201cCause\u201d or by the executive officer for \u201cGood Reason,\u201d as described in \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger\u2014Executive Severance Benefits\u201d on page 62 of this proxy\nstatement\u037e\n\u25cf\nConversion of Equity Awards.

The Voting Stockholders are also\nsubject to certain restrictions on (i) transfers of their shares of GCP common stock and (ii) solicitation with respect to acquisition proposals, as\ndescribed in \u201cVoting Agreements\u201d on page 107 of this proxy statement.\nAs of the Record Date, Starboard and Standard held, in the aggregate, approximately 8.8% and 24.0%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of GCP\ncommon stock.\n8\nTable of Contents\nRights Agreement Amendment (page 109)\nOn December 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, GCP entered into the Second Amendment to Rights Agreement\n(the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d and, together with the Rights Agreement, the \u201cAmended Rights Agreement\u201d), by and between GCP and Equiniti Trust\nCompany, as rights agent (the \u201cRights Agent\u201d), which amends the Rights Agreement dated as of March 15, 2019, by and between GCP and the\nRights Agent (the \u201cOriginal Rights Agreement\u201d), as amended by the First Amendment to Rights Agreement (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d and, together\nwith the Original Rights Agreement, the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d), by and between the Company and the Rights Agent on March 13, 2020.\nThe Second Amendment provides that none of Saint-Gobain, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or Associates (as such\nterms are defined in the Rights Agreement), either individually or collectively, shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person (as defined in the\nAmended Rights Agreement) as a result of (i) the approval, adoption, execution, delivery and, if applicable, any amendment, of the Merger\nAgreement or the Voting Agreements, (ii) the acquisition or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the common stock of GCP as a result of\nexecution of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) the execution and entry of the Voting Agreements by the parties thereto\u037e (iv) the exercise by Parent of its\nrights under the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreements\u037e or (v) the public announcement and consummation of the Merger or the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements. Further, the Second Amendment provides that none of the\nexecution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, will result in a Shares Acquisition Date (as defined in the Rights\nAgreement) or Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or permit any Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to be exercised or\nexchanged pursuant to the Rights Agreement.\nPursuant to the Second Amendment, the Amended Rights Agreement and the rights issued thereunder will terminate and expire immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time without any payment in respect thereof.\nGuarantee (page 86)\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Saint-Gobain has agreed to guarantee the due, punctual and complete performance and payment in full of all\nobligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent and Merger Sub fail or\nare unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform such obligations, Saint-Gobain will promptly pay or perform, or cause to be paid or\nperformed, such obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing, Saint-Gobain has agreed to take, and to cause to be taken by its affiliates and\nsubsidiaries (including Parent and Merger Sub), all actions required to be taken by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with certain terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement relating to approvals, consents and filings, with respect to the assets, properties or businesses of Saint-Gobain\nand its affiliates and subsidiaries.\nAppraisal Rights (page 69)\nRecord holders of common stock of GCP will be entitled to seek statutory appraisal of their shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in\nconnection with the Merger. This means that such stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and, if all requirements of\nSection 262 are met, to receive payment in cash for the \u201cfair value\u201d of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\namount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the\namount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement. For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the\n9\nTable of Contents\nprocedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the\nDGCL, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, as well as the information set forth below.\nIN ORDER TO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, A RECORD HOLDER MUST DELIVER\nA WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL TO GCP BEFORE\nTHE VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON OR BY\nPROXY, IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL, MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK OF RECORD FROM THE\nDATE OF MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER AND MUST COMPLY WITH THE\nOTHER REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE, UNDER DELAWARE LAW, ONLY A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD CAN\nSUBMIT A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL, A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD\nIN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY\nSECTION 262 OF THE DGCL AND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MERELY VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL WILL NOT PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE A PROXY THAT IS SIGNED\nAND SUBMITTED BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN VOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL, UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE\nADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST\nINCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK AGAINST, OR ABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO, THE\nADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, NOR\nABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, WILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN\nDEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL\nMUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IF YOU\nHOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY SUCH BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE. IN VIEW OF THE\nCOMPLEXITY OF THE DGCL, STOCKHOLDERS WHO MAY WISH TO PURSUE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD PROMPTLY CONSULT THEIR\nLEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 75)\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d on page 76 of this proxy statement) in exchange for such U.S. holder\u2019s shares of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally result in\nthe recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. holder receives in the Merger\n(including any cash required to be withheld for tax purposes) and such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such surrendered shares. Gain or loss will\nbe determined separately for each block of shares of GCP common stock (that is, shares acquired for the same cost in a single transaction). A non-\nU.S. holder (as defined in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d on page 77 of this proxy statement) will\ngenerally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of such non-U.S. holder\u2019s shares of GCP common stock for cash in\nthe Merger unless (1) such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or (2) GCP is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real\nproperty\n10\nTable of Contents\nholding corporation. Stockholders should refer to \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d on page 75 of this\nproxy statement, and consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their\nparticular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 79)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), has expired or been terminated and clearance of the Merger has been granted under the\nantitrust and foreign investment laws of certain specified foreign jurisdictions. The Merger Agreement contains covenants by Parent and Merger\nSub to use their best efforts (including, if necessary, through litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to obtain regulatory approval\nfor the Merger under applicable competition laws, including the HSR Act, and foreign investment laws.\nNo Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Recommendation (page 92)\nExcept as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, we have agreed that after the date of the Merger Agreement we will, and will cause our\nsubsidiaries to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause our and our subsidiaries\u2019 representatives to, (x) promptly cease and cause to be terminated\nany and all activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any\nacquisition proposal, including immediately terminating all access granted to any third party to any physical or electronic data room, and (y) request\nthat any such third party (and its agents and advisors) promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning GCP and its subsidiaries\nthat was furnished by or on behalf of GCP and its subsidiaries.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed not to, and to cause\nour subsidiaries and our and our subsidiaries\u2019 respective directors, officers, and employees not to, and to direct and use reasonable best efforts to\ncause our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other respective representatives on their behalf not to, directly or indirectly:\n\u25cf\ninitiate, solicit, propose, knowingly facilitate, encourage or induce the making, the submission or the announcement of any acquisition\nproposal\u037e\n\u25cf\nconduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information relating to GCP or any of its\nsubsidiaries, to any third party or its representatives, or afford to any third party or its representatives access to the business,\nproperties, assets, books, records or other non-public information of GCP or its subsidiaries, in each case, that could reasonably be\nexpected to lead to the submission of an acquisition proposal\u037e\n\u25cf\nexcept where the Board makes a good faith determination that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with GCP directors\u2019 fiduciary\nduties under applicable law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of\nequity securities of GCP or any of its subsidiaries\u037e\n\u25cf\napprove, recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or other\ncontract relating to any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement in the circumstance and\nupon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e or\n\u25cf\nexcept as expressly contemplated in the Merger Agreement, terminate, waive or amend or grant any exemptions under or redeem any\nrights under the Company\u2019s stockholder rights plan.\n1\n1\nTable of Contents\nNotwithstanding the foregoing restrictions (collectively, the \u201cno shop restrictions\u201d), under certain circumstances following receipt of a bona fide\nwritten acquisition proposal from a third party, we may (i) furnish information with respect to GCP and its subsidiaries to the third party making such\nacquisition proposal and its representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to GCP than its confidentiality\nagreement with Saint-Gobain and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party regarding such acquisition proposal (as\ndescribed in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Recommendation\u201d on page 92 of this proxy statement).\nUnder certain circumstances following receipt of a superior proposal, the Board may, prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, effect a change\nof recommendation with respect to such superior proposal and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a company acquisition agreement\nwith respect to such superior proposal pursuant to the terms thereof, in either case, subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements\nas set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Recommendation\u201d on\npage 93 of this proxy statement). In addition, GCP shall not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement for a superior proposal unless GCP pays\nthe termination fee described in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee\u201d on page 104 of this proxy statement.\nIn response to an intervening event prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may effect a\nchange of recommendation subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements as set forth in the Merger Agreement (see \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014No Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Recommendation\u201d on page 94 of this proxy statement).\nFor a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and the Board\u2019s ability to make a change of\nrecommendation with respect to the Merger Proposal, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation of Other Offers\u037e Change of Recommendation\u201d\non page 92 of this proxy statement.\nConditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 101)\nThe parties expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022. However, it is possible that factors outside of each party\u2019s control could\nrequire them to complete the Merger at a later time or not to complete it at all. The following are some of the conditions that must be satisfied or,\nwhere permitted by law, waived before the Merger may be completed:\n\u25cf\nthe approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the vote of holders of a majority of shares of GCP common stock\noutstanding as of the record date and entitled to vote on the matter (the \u201cstockholder

A second individual complaint was filed on January 21, 2022 in the SDNY, a third\nindividual complaint was filed on January 28, 2022 in the SDNY, and a fourth individual complaint was filed on January 29, 2022 in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaints are captioned as follows: Stein v. GCP Applied Technologies, Inc., et al., Case\nNo. 1:22-cv-00436\u037e and Waterman v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00583\u037e Le v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al.,\nCase No. 1:22-cv-00750\u037e and Newman v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00545. The complaints name as defendants GCP\nand members of the Board. The complaints generally allege that the defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy\nstatement on Schedule 14A with the SEC. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections of GCP, (ii) certain financial analyses of\nRBCCM, and (iii) the amount of certain compensation provided to RBCCM unrelated to the Merger. The Le complaint also alleges that the sale\nprocess leading up to the Merger and the disclosure relating thereto was flawed, and certain conflicts of interest of GCP\u2019s management in the\nMerger. The Newman complaint also alleges that the disclosure relating to the sale process leading up to the Merger was flawed. The complaints\nseek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, damages, and other relief.\nThe defendants believe the claims asserted in these complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits related to the Merger may be filed in the\nfuture.\n14\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nIn the ordinary course, our Board and management team regularly review and assess our results of operations, financial position, business strategy and\ngrowth opportunities, as well as the trends and conditions affecting our industries and business generally. Such assessments include periodic meetings\nor consultations with third-party advisors, as well as consideration of potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value, such as\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions and financing transactions. Our Board and management team periodically discuss the Company\u2019s business strategy\nand potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value.\nIn February 2019, our Board commenced a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including a potential sale or other business\ncombination. In connection with this process, the Company, working with its financial advisor at the time, contacted 36 strategic parties, including Saint-\nGobain and a strategic party referred to as \u201cParty A\u201d, and 12 private equity sponsors, including a private equity sponsor referred to as \u201cParty B.\u201d\nFollowing this outreach, the Company entered into customary confidentiality agreements with five strategic parties, including Party A, and nine private\nequity sponsors, including Party B, and furnished customary business and financial diligence information to these parties. Although one strategic party\nand one private equity sponsor submitted initial non-binding indications of interest for a potential sale transaction at that time and the Company also\nmade customary management presentations to these parties, these parties subsequently withdrew from the process and did not submit a final proposal to\nacquire the Company. None of Saint-Gobain, Party A or Party B submitted an initial indication of interest at the time or received a management\npresentation. Accordingly, the Board determined to continue to execute a standalone business strategy for the Company at that time.\n34Table of Contents\nFrom time to time in 2019 and continuing into 2020, the former chief executive officer of the Company and the chief executive officer of Party A discussed\na potential business combination of the Company with Party A. These discussions did not result in a proposal from Party A during that period.\nAt the Company\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2020, a majority of new directors were elected to our Board following a contested\nelection and proxy contest, including eight directors nominated by Starboard. Mr. Peter Feld was appointed as Chairman of the Board following this\nannual meeting of stockholders.\nOn November 23, 2020, Mr. Feld emailed the chief executive officer of Party A introducing Mr. Bates as the new chief executive officer of the Company.\nMr. Feld believed it would be productive for two chief executive officers in similar businesses to become acquainted. The following day, Mr. Bates\nintroduced himself to the chief executive officer of Party A via email, indicating that Mr. Bates would contact the chief executive officer of Party A in the\nnear future.\nDuring the week of January 24, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to become acquainted. The parties discussed their respective\nbusinesses, and the chief executive officer of Party A referenced Party A\u2019s historical interest in considering a possible business combination of the\nCompany with Party A and prior discussions with the former chief executive officer of the Company, noting that there had always been a significant gap\nbetween the respective views of the two parties about the valuation of the Company.\nOn August 6, 2021, Mr. Bates and a representative of Party B had a telephone call in which the parties discussed the Company\u2019s business and strategy\ngenerally, and Party B enquired whether the Company would be interested in a conversation to explore potential transaction opportunities with Party B.\nMr. Bates indicated that the Company would be willing to consider exploratory conversations, but that the Company would request that Party B enter\ninto a customary non-disclosure agreement to facilitate those discussions.\nOn August 16, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A emailed Mr. Feld and Mr. Bates to request a telephone call to follow up on their prior discussion\nregarding Party A\u2019s potential interest in an acquisition of the Company.\nAlso on August 16, 2021, following up on Party B\u2019s prior inquiry, the Company and Party B signed a customary non-disclosure agreement, which did not\ninclude a standstill provision, to allow for confidential exploratory discussions regarding potential transaction opportunities involving Party B and GCP.\nOn August 17, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with the chief executive officer of Party A, during which the chief executive officer of Party A\nexpressed Party A\u2019s interest in exploring an acquisition of the Company. Mr. Bates stated the Board\u2019s confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business\nplan, but noted that if Party A had significant interest in an acquisition of the Company, Party A should submit a written proposal to the Company.\nOn August 18, 2021, Mr. Bates and Mr. Valente, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, and representatives of Party B held a\nvideoconference to discuss the Company\u2019s business and strategy generally, as well as the type of financial information that Party B would require for\nexploratory conversations about potential transaction opportunities with Party B.\nOn August 20, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates to affirm Party A\u2019s interest in the Company and indicated that Party A would\nsubmit a non-binding proposal in writing to acquire the Company. Shortly thereafter, Party A sent its non-binding proposal to acquire GCP for $29.00 per\nshare of GCP common stock (the \u201cFirst Party A Proposal\u201d), which consisted of 50% cash (representing $14.50 per share) and\n35\nTable of Contents\n50% newly-issued shares of Party A\u2019s common stock (representing 0.17 shares of Party A common stock per share of GCP common stock ). The non-\nbinding proposal was subject to due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation. While the proposal would not be subject to any financing\ncontingency, Party A indicated its desire to pursue financing, including externally sourced debt. Mr. Bates confirmed receipt of Party A\u2019s non-binding\nproposal and indicated that the Board would discuss at an upcoming meeting and he would respond back to the chief executive officer of Party A after\nthat meeting. On August 17, 2021, the closing price of GCP common stock was $23.49 per share.\nOn August 26, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, including management and representatives of Latham & Watkins LLP, outside legal\ncounsel to GCP (referred to as \u201cLatham\u201d), to review the recent discussions with Party A and Party B and to consider how to respond to the First Party A\nProposal. Management reviewed the business, strategic and financial position of GCP as a standalone company, together with the financial aspects of the\nFirst Party A Proposal. Representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board in the context of the First Party A\nProposal. After discussion and deliberation, the Board determined that the First Party A Proposal undervalued the Company and was inadequate, that the\nCompany should continue to execute its existing business strategy, and that management should respond in writing to Party A, declining the First Party\nA Proposal. The Board also determined, based on various factors, including, among other things, the Board\u2019s and management\u2019s knowledge of the\nCompany, the Company\u2019s business, and the industry in which the Company operates, that it did not believe the Company should incur the expense of\nengaging a financial advisor at that time, given the Board\u2019s determination not to move forward with the First Party A Proposal.\nOn August 30, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A and indicated that the Board had unanimously rejected the First Party A\nProposal, believing that the proposal undervalued the Company. Shortly thereafter, the Company sent a letter to the chief executive officer of Party A,\nindicating that Party A\u2019s proposal undervalued the Company and did not provide a basis for productive discussion. The Company indicated in the letter\nthat the interests of the Company and its stockholders would be best served by continuing to pursue the Company\u2019s existing business strategy.\nOn September 7, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates to indicate Party A\u2019s continued interest in the Company. In this conversation,\nthe chief executive officer of Party A indicated that Party A could increase the First Party A Proposal above $29.00 per share and could offer all cash\nconsideration. Mr. Bates relayed this conversation to Mr. Feld in a call on September 9, 2021 and Messrs. Feld and Bates determined to request that Party\nA provide a revised proposal in writing.\nOn September 10, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to request that, if Party A had continued interest in an acquisition of the\nCompany at a price above $29.00 per share, Party A should submit a revised written proposal to the Company. The chief executive officer of Party A\nindicated that he would discuss further with Party A\u2019s board of directors, but proposed an in-person meeting in Florida for October 21, 2021.\nOn September 15, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with a representative of Party B to continue exploratory conversations about the potential\ntransaction opportunities with Party B. The representative of Party B asked if the Company would be open to providing limited financial information to\nfacilitate further discussions. Mr. Bates responded that the Company would be open to further discussions and that Party B should reach out to Mr. Craig\nMerrill, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, to coordinate exchange of limited financial information.\nOn September 21, 2021, a representative of Party B contacted Mr. Merrill to request limited financial information with respect to the Company. Party B\nsubsequently emailed a targeted request for financial information regarding the Company to Mr. Merrill.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn September 28, 2021, Mr. Benoit Bazin, the Chief Executive Officer of Saint-Gobain, emailed Mr. Bates to introduce himself and propose an in-person\nmeeting to discuss potential business opportunities when Mr. Bazin was next in the United States. After discussion with Mr. Feld and members of the\nBoard, Mr. Bates responded to Mr. Bazin to propose a meeting on October 14, 2021.\nOn September 29, 2021, Mr. Merrill furnished certain limited financial information regarding the Company to Party B. Mr. Merrill had a telephone call with\nrepresentatives of Party B on October 5, 2021 to discuss this information. In response to a follow-up request from Party B, Mr. Merrill provided certain\nadditional financial information regarding the Company to Party B on October 11, 2021 and October 12, 2021.\nOn October 14, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Bazin had an in-person meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr. Bazin introduced Saint-Gobain and its business\nand strategy, explained the strategic rationale for Saint-Gobain\u2019s purchase of Chryso, a leading global construction chemicals company, completed in\nSeptember 2021, noted Saint-Gobain\u2019s view that the Company would fit with Saint-Gobain and its business and strategy, and expressed Saint-Gobain\u2019s\ninterest in considering a potential acquisition of the Company. Mr. Bates then reviewed the Company\u2019s business and strategy. Mr. Bates stated the\nBoard\u2019s confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan, but noted that if Saint-Gobain had significant interest in an acquisition of the Company,\nSaint-Gobain should submit a written proposal to the Company. No non-public information was exchanged during this meeting.\nOn October 18, 2021, Saint-Gobain submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $29.00 per share in cash (the \u201cFirst Saint-Gobain\nProposal\u201d), conditioned on the Company\u2019s receipt of customary voting agreements from certain of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The First Saint-Gobain\nProposal also indicated that Saint-Gobain had sufficient cash on its balance sheet to fund the purchase price and that the proposal would not be subject\nto any financing condition, that Saint-Gobain had the ability to sign and announce within three to four weeks after commencing substantive discussions,\nand that the First Saint-Gobain Proposal would be contingent on negotiations being conducted on an expedited bilateral basis. On October 18, 2021, the\nclosing price of GCP common stock was $22.45 per share.\nDuring the period leading up to the November 1, 2021 meeting of the Board, Messrs. Bates and Feld had numerous conversations, including with other\nmembers of the Board and members of senior management, to discuss the First Saint-Gobain Proposal, the upcoming meeting with the chief executive\nofficer of Party A, and whether to move forward with formal discussions with Saint-Gobain and Party A with respect to a potential transaction at that time.\nGiven the expressed interest of two highly credible strategic parties, the opportunity to facilitate a competitive process to realize additional value for the\nCompany and its stockholders, and the expectation that each of the two strategic bidders would increase their initial non-binding proposals subject to\ncompletion of due diligence, it was determined that the Company should continue preliminary discussions with each of Saint-Gobain and Party A in the\nnear term, and to discuss whether to move forward with more formal discussions with the full Board at its next meeting.\nOn October 19, 2021, Mr. Bazin called Mr. Feld to discuss Saint-Gobain\u2019s interest in the Company and to review the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Mr. Feld\nindicated that he would discuss with other Board members and expected the Company to provide initial feedback on process and timing promptly.\nOn October 21, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A met in person with Mr. Bates in Florida to discuss Party A\u2019s continued interest in a potential\nacquisition of the Company and the potential opportunities for synergies from such a merger. Mr. Bates stated that if Party A had continued interest in an\nacquisition of the Company, Party A should submit a revised proposal to the Company in writing. The chief executive officer of Party A indicated that,\nbefore Party A could submit a revised proposal to the Company, Party A would need to review confidential financial diligence information regarding the\nCompany and evaluate potential opportunities for synergies in a proposed transaction. Mr. Bates noted that, based on his discussions with Mr. Feld and\nother members of the Board, he expected the Board would prefer an all-cash offer in order to, among other things, maximize certainty of value. No non-\npublic information was exchanged during this meeting.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOn October 23, 2021, Mr. Bates had a call with Mr. Bazin to provide initial feedback on the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Mr. Bates indicated that the\nCompany appreciated Saint-Gobain\u2019s interest and he expected the Board to discuss the proposal further at its upcoming meeting, but that the proposal\nundervalued the Company. Mr. Bates reiterated the Board\u2019s confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan, and noted that there was another\nstrategic third party interested in the Company that the Board also would be considering at its upcoming meeting.\nOn October 26 and 27, 2021, Mr. Bates and Mr. Bazin exchanged emails in which Mr. Bates indicated that, based on his conversations with Mr. Feld and\nthe significant third party interest in the Company, Mr. Bates anticipated the Board would consider further discussions with Saint-Gobain if Saint-Gobain\nwould be willing to increase its proposal. Mr. Bazin confirmed that Saint-Gobain expected to be able to increase its offer following its review of financial\ndue diligence. Mr. Bates noted that further discussions would need to be approved by the Board at its upcoming meeting. The parties discussed that, if\nfurther discussions were approved by the Board, a customary confidentiality agreement would need to be in place, and the Company subsequently\ncirculated a draft confidentiality agreement to Saint-Gobain.\nOn October 28, 2021, Saint-Gobain entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with GCP, which included a customary one year standstill\nprovision. The standstill provision expressly permitted confidential proposals to the Board and was subject to a customary \u201csunset\u201d provision on the\npublic announcement of the sale of 50% or more of GCP common stock.\nOn November 1, 2021, the Board met via videoconference, including Messrs. Merrill and Valente. Messrs. Feld and Bates updated the Board on the recent\ndiscussions with Party A and Saint-Gobain, including the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Management reviewed the business, operations and financial\nperformance of the Company, and the Board discussed the opportunity to facilitate a competitive process between two highly credible strategic parties to\nrealize additional value for the Company and its stockholders. Following this discussion, the Board authorized further discussions with each of Party A\nand Saint-Gobain, including management presentations and furnishing certain financial information to allow each party to submit revised proposals to\nacquire the Company. In addition, the Board discussed the status of the exploratory discussions with Party B and determined, based on preliminary\nnature of those discussions, the Board\u2019s general understanding that a private equity sponsor was unlikely to be in a position to acquire the Company at a\nvalue in excess of a motivated strategic party with identified opportunities for synergies and the Board\u2019s desire for management to focus on facilitating a\ncompetitive process between Party A and Saint-Gobain to maximize value, that the Company should defer further discussions with Party B. The Board\nalso determined, based on various factors, including, among other things, the Board\u2019s and management\u2019s knowledge of the Company, the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry in which the Company operates, that it did not believe the Company should incur the expense of engaging a financial advisor\nat that time, but that management should begin confidential discussions with potential financial advisors to be in a position to advise the Board, when\nand if revised proposals were obtained that, the Board believed, provided a basis to move forward.\nOn November 2, 2021, Mr. Bates called Mr. Bazin to indicate that the Board had approved further discussions with Saint-Gobain and another interested\nstrategic party regarding a potential acquisition of the Company, and that the Company proposed to schedule a management presentation and furnish\ncertain financial information to allow the bidders to submit revised proposals. Mr. Bates noted the Board continued to have confidence in the Company\u2019s\nstandalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, but had authorized a targeted process to explore whether a potential transaction\nwould realize additional value for the Company and its stockholders.\nAlso on November 2, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to indicate that there was another strategic party interested in a potential\nacquisition of the Company, and that the Board had determined to invite both Party A and the other strategic party to evaluate the Company in greater\ndetail, including a management presentation and review of certain limited financial information, after signing a\n38\nTable of Contents\ncustomary confidentiality agreement. Mr. Bates noted the Board continued to have confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan and had not\ndetermined to sell the Company, but had authorized a targeted process to explore whether a potential transaction would realize additional value for the\nCompany and its stockholders. On November 3, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates and discussed the Company conducting a\npresentation to the management of Party A on November 18 and 19, 2021.\nOn November 3, 2021 and November 4, 2021, the Board met in person in Alpharetta, Georgia. During the meeting, in addition to its regular business, the\nBoard discussed the status of discussions with Party A and Saint-Gobain, as well as the Company\u2019s standalone business plan and strategy.\nOn November 4, 2021, Party A signed a customary confidentiality agreement which included a customary eighteen month standstill provision. The\nstandstill provision expressly permitted confidential proposals to the Board and was subject to a customary \u201csunset\u201d provision on the public\nannouncement of the sale of 50% or more of GCP common stock.\nOn November 11, 2021, Saint-Gobain and the Company entered into a customary clean team agreement, which addressed disclosure of competitively\nsensitive information between the parties. Later that day and continuing into November 12, 2021, the Company held a management presentation via an in-\nperson meeting with Saint-Gobain regarding the Company\u2019s business, products, operations, financial performance and estimates, as well as potential\nopportunities for synergies and acquisition opportunities for Saint-Gobain in a potential transaction. Saint-Gobain was subsequently granted access to a\nvirtual data room that included customary business, financial, accounting, environmental, human resources and legal diligence information, in order for\nSaint-Gobain to conduct its due diligence review of the Company. At the conclusion of the meeting, Messrs. Bates and Bazin, together with other\nmembers of senior management of the Company and Saint-Gobain, discussed next steps in the process and timing. Mr. Bates reiterated that the Board\ncontinued to have confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, that the process approved by the\nBoard was targeted and exploratory only, and that Saint-Gobain would need to improve the First Saint-Gobain Proposal for the Board to move forward\nwith further discussions.\nOn November 16, 2021, Party A was granted access to the virtual data room that included customary business, financial, accounting, environmental,\nhuman resources and legal diligence information, in order for Party A to conduct its due diligence review of the Company. On the same date, Party A and\nthe Company entered into a customary clean team agreement, which addressed disclosure of competitively sensitive information between the parties.\nOn November 18, 2021, Mr. Feld called Mr. Bazin to discuss the First Saint-Gobain Proposal in greater detail. Mr. Feld noted that the Board appreciated\nSaint-Gobain\u2019s interest in the Company and that the Board would fully consider any revised proposal. Mr. Feld shared with Mr. Bazin that the Board\ncontinued to have confidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan and that the Board believed that the Company was undervalued. Mr. Feld\ninformed Mr. Bazin that the Board felt that the First Saint-Gobain Proposal undervalued the Company and that if Saint-Gobain wanted to pursue an\nacquisition of the Company that the purchase price would need to be meaningfully increased. Mr. Feld also mentioned that there had been other strategic\ninterest in the Company.\nOn November 18 and 19, 2021, the management of the Company held a presentation for Party A in Atlanta, Georgia. During the management presentation,\nthe Company discussed its business, products, operations, financial performance and estimates, as well as potential opportunities for synergies for Party\nA in a potential transaction. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Bates and chief executive officer of Party A, together with other members of senior\nmanagement of the Company and Party A, discussed next steps in the process and timing. Mr. Bates reiterated that the Board continued to have\nconfidence in the Company\u2019s standalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, that the process approved by the Board was\ntargeted and exploratory only, and that Party A would need to submit a proposal at a price significantly above the First Party A Proposal for the Board to\nmove forward with further discussions.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOn November 19, 2021, Mr. Bazin corresponded with both Mr. Bates and Mr. Feld to convey a revised offer from Saint-Gobain of $30.00 per share in cash.\nSaint-Gobain then sent an updated non-binding written proposal to acquire the Company for $30.00 per share in cash (the \u201cSecond Saint-Gobain\nProposal\u201d). The Second Saint-Gobain Proposal was subject to the completion of diligence and negotiation of definitive documents. The offer requested a\nresponse by November 29, 2021, and was conditioned on the commitment to work on an expedited, bilateral and confidential basis, as well as receipt of\ncustomary voting agreements from certain stockholders of the Company. Saint-Gobain indicated its ability to sign and announce within two weeks after\ncommencing substantive discussions. On November 19, 2021, the closing price of GCP Common Stock was $23.44 per share.\nOn November 22, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was held via teleconference, with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Latham in\nattendance, during which the Board discussed the status of the proposals from Party A and Saint-Gobain. The Board also considered and discussed the\nManagement Projections (for details, see \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d) with members of management and received presentations from\nrepresentatives of RBCCM (as a potential financial advisor at that time), which included preliminary financial analyses relating to the Company\u2019s\nstandalone business strategy, and a presentation from representatives of another potential financial advisor to the Company, which included a review of\nstrategic and financial alternatives available to the Company, including continuing to pursue the Company\u2019s standalone business strategy, seeking to\nenhance return of capital to stockholders by using excess liquidity or incremental debt financing to fund either a special dividend or share buyback,\npursuing one or more meaningful acquisitions for cash and/or stock considerations, or a sale of the Company to strategic or financial sponsor parties.\nThe Board determined that, in light of the proposal received from Saint-Gobain and the expectation that a revised proposal would be received from Party\nA shortly, as well as the opportunity to realize additional value in a competitive process between Party A and Saint-Gobain, the Company should continue\nto explore a potential sale transaction with both Party A and Saint-Gobain. In this context, the Board determined it was not appropriate to grant exclusivity\nto either Party A or Saint-Gobain.\nOn November 23, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates and shared that a revised offer would be submitted in writing later that day.\nShortly thereafter, the Company received a non-binding proposal for Party A to acquire the Company for $31.00 per share, which consisted of 50% cash\n(representing $15.50 per share) and 50% of newly-issued shares of Party A\u2019s publicly-traded common stock (representing 0.18 shares of Party A common\nstock per share of GCP common stock), but with the option for the Company to receive $31.00 per share all in cash if preferable to the Board (the \u201cSecond\nParty A Proposal\u201d). The Second Party A Proposal was subject to the completion of diligence and negotiation of definitive documents. The Second Party\nA Proposal indicated Party A\u2019s desire to pursue customary financing, including externally sourced debt, but stated that the Second Party A Proposal was\nnot subject to a financing contingency. The Second Party A Proposal indicated a three to four week timeline to complete negotiations, diligence, and sign\nand announce the transaction. On November 23, 2021, the closing price of GCP Common Stock was $23.07 per share.\nOn November 24, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was held via teleconference, together with management and representatives from RBCCM and\nLatham. During the meeting, representatives from Latham reviewed the fiduciary obligations of the Board when considering potential strategic\ntransactions, including a potential sale transaction. Representatives from RBCCM provided the Board an update with respect to certain financial\nanalyses, as well as strategies to maximize stockholder value, and reviewed various potential deal processes. It was noted that Saint-Gobain and Party A\nwere highly qualified strategic bidders, with the opportunity to realize synergies in a potential transaction with the Company, and, taking into\nconsideration the strategic alternative process from the spring of 2019, that outreach to other potential strategic parties or financial sponsors (including\nParty B) at that time was not expected to realize additional value for the Company and its stockholders. The Board reviewed the terms of the RBCCM\nengagement and certain customary disclosures provided by RBCCM with respect to its relationships with the Company, Saint-Gobain and Party A, and\nselected RBCCM as the Company\u2019s financial advisor on the basis of, among other things, RBCCM\u2019s reputation, experience, knowledge and familiarity\nwith the Company and its industry, and lack of material conflicts. The\n40\nTable of Contents\nBoard authorized Mr. Bates to work with Mr. Feld to finalize an engagement letter with RBCCM. With respect to the Second Saint-Gobain Proposal and\nthe Second Party A Proposal, the Board determined to move forward with both Party A and Saint-Gobain and authorized the Company\u2019s management and\nRBCCM to advise the bidders of a proposed process for due diligence and submission of revised proposals. The Board determined that it would not\ngrant exclusivity to either bidder at that time.\nThat evening, Mr. Bates called Mr. Bazin to inform him that the Second Saint-Gobain Proposal was no longer competitive and needed to be increased and\nthat the Board was not willing to grant exclusivity, but that the Board had authorized the Company to work with RBCCM towards obtaining final bids and\npotentially sign definitive documents by the week of December 13, 2021. Mr. Bazin indicated that he would come back with a revised proposal after\ncompletion of due diligence, but that the Company\u2019s stated timeline was too long and that Saint-Gobain would be in a position to submit its final\nproposal, sign definitive transaction documents and announce by Monday, December 6, 2021.\nOn November 26, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to explain that the Board had reviewed the Second Party A Proposal and had\ndetermined to move forward with a competitive process, with the most important considerations for the Board being value, certainty, and speed. In\nresponse to a question from Mr. Bates, Party A clarified that the implied value of the 50% cash and 50% of Party A common stock offer was intended to\nbe the same $31.00 per share as the all-cash offer. Mr. Bates shared that RBCCM and Latham had been hired as advisors to represent the Company, and\nfurther discussed timing, due diligence, and next steps.\nOn November 28, 2021, Mr. Valente contacted Antoine Vignial, the Corporate Secretary of Saint-Gobain to discuss process and timing. Mr. Valente\nindicated that additional materials would be provided in the virtual data room, with a merger agreement draft to be distributed on the same day. It was\nnoted that the regulatory teams of Latham and the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (\u201cFreshfields\u201d), outside legal counsel to Saint-Gobain, should\ndiscuss competition and foreign investment filings.\nThat evening, representatives of Latham and Freshfields met telephonically to discuss process and timing, including the timing for distribution of a draft\nmerger agreement, the process for considering voting agreements requested by Saint-Gobain, due diligence and the process to confirm antitrust and\nforeign investment filing requirements. Representatives of Freshfields indicated that Saint-Gobain wanted to sign by the end of the week. Representatives\nof Latham noted that the process was competitive and that representatives of RBCCM had communicated expectations on process to representatives of\nthe financial advisors to Saint-Gobain.\nOn November 29, 2021, representatives of Latham met telephonically with the outside legal counsel to Party A to discuss process and timing, including\nthe timing for distribution of a draft merger agreement, the process for considering voting agreements requested by Party A, due diligence and the\nprocess to confirm antitrust filing requirements. Party A\u2019s legal counsel indicated that they understood the process could be moving forward on an\naccelerated timeline. Latham explained that the process was moving quickly and that Party A should work as quickly as possible to remain competitive.\nOn the afternoon of November 29, 2021, Latham furnished the draft merger agreement to the legal representatives of each of Party A and Saint-Gobain.\nThe draft merger agreement provided for, among other things, cash consideration, customary non-solicitation and fiduciary out provisions, including the\nability for the Company to consider unsolicited competing proposals, customary information and access rights for the bidder, an initial three calendar day\nmatch period (reduced to one calendar day for subsequent bids), the ability for the Company to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior\nproposal, the ability for the Company to change its recommendation for an intervening event, a termination fee equal to 2% of transaction equity value, a\n\u201chell or high water\u201d antitrust covenant and no financing condition.\nDuring the period leading up to December 3, 2021, the Company and its financial and legal advisors posted additional documents to the virtual data\nrooms to which Party A and Saint-Gobain had access, held\n41\nTable of Contents\ndiligence calls and hosted facility visits with each of Party A and its financial, legal and other advisors, and Saint-Gobain and its financial, legal and other\nadvisors. The various diligence materials covered topics that included business, financial, commercial, tax, legal, compliance, human resources,\nenvironmental, intellectual property and information technology issues.\nOn December 1, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with the chief executive officer of Party A, indicating that the Company expected to receive a revised,\nhigher cash offer from another bidder, that the other bidder was accelerating its process, had made considerable progress on its merger agreement, and\ncould be in a position to sign within 72 hours of its revised offer. Mr. Bates suggested that Party A provide the Company with crucial diligence requests\nin order to support an increased offer from Party A, and asked if Party A was willing to increase its offer. The chief executive officer of Party A confirmed\nthat Party A had the ability to increase the Second Party A Proposal.\nOn December 1, 2021, Party A requested consent to furnish the Company\u2019s name on a confidential basis to rating agencies as part of a process to arrange\npotential debt financing. The Company promptly granted such consent. On December 1, 2021, an article was published on Bloomberg.com, an industry\nnews site that covers mergers and acquisitions, speculating that the Company was considering strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the\nCompany. The Company declined to comment on this article or subsequent market speculation, consistent with its corporate policy that it does not\ncomment on market rumors or speculation. On November 30, 2021, the last trading day prior to the article being published on the Bloomberg.com website,\nthe Company\u2019s stock price closed at $23.34 per share.\nIn the evening on December 1, 2021, Freshfields sent a mark-up to the merger agreement to Latham together with proposed form voting agreements for\nStarboard and Standard, respectively. Key changes to this revised merger agreement draft included an increased matching period of five business days\n(reduced to three business days for subsequent proposals), a termination fee equal to 3.75% of transaction equity value, and an additional fee equal to\n1% of transaction equity value payable if, among other things, the Company\u2019s stockholders did not vote to approve the proposed transaction (also\nknown as a \u201cnaked no vote\u201d). Saint-Gobain had agreed to the proposed \u201chell or high water\u201d divestiture covenant. The voting agreement drafts were in\ncustomary form and would terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement, but would not terminate if the Board otherwise changed its\nrecommendation without terminating the merger agreement.\nOn December 2, 2021, Mr. Bates and the chief executive officer of Party A exchanged emails reviewing critical due diligence items and providing feedback\nregarding the completion of various diligence requests.\nOn December 2, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Valente had separate calls with Messrs. Bazin and Vignial of Saint-Gobain to discuss the timing and process of\nthe proposed transaction. Mr. Vignial subsequently indicated that Saint-Gobain had substantially completed its due diligence, the only remaining item\nbeing the completion of the planned site visit on December 3, 2021. Later that day, Mr. Bazin called Mr. Bates to confirm that significant progress had\nbeen made and indicated Saint-Gobain wanted to accelerate the process. Mr. Bazin separately confirmed to Mr. Feld that he spoke to Mr. Bates and\nindicated that Saint-Gobain\u2019s due diligence was substantially complete pending a last site visit for the next day, December 3, 2021. Mr. Bazin requested\nthat Latham and Freshfields work to revise the merger agreement and converge on finalized terms by the end of the day on December 3, 2021.\nOn the afternoon of December 2, 2021, representatives of Latham held a teleconference with legal counsel to Party A to discuss the status of the\napplicable merger agreement draft, process and timing. Party A\u2019s legal counsel indicated that an updated merger agreement draft would be sent later that\nevening, but that Party A would not offer a \u201chell or high water\u201d clause, but instead would offer a limited divestiture covenant subject to a cap, and a\nreverse termination fee that would be equal to the Company\u2019s termination fee. Party A\u2019s legal counsel also asked whether there would be additional time\nthe following week to finalize the merger agreement.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRepresentatives of Latham indicated that the process was competitive and moving quickly, and that Party A should make its best proposal relative to\nantitrust commitments and financing as soon as possible to remain competitive.\nLater that day, representatives of RBCCM held a teleconference with representatives of the financial advisor to Party A and communicated that the\nprocess timeline was accelerating and that Party A should work quickly to increase value, shorten the timeline for signing definitive transaction\ndocuments and provide additional certainty of consummation of a transaction.\nAlso on December 2, 2021, representatives of Latham held a teleconference with representatives of Freshfields to discuss the status of the merger\nagreement draft, process and timing. Latham indicated that a revised draft of the merger agreement would be forthcoming on December 3, 2021, including\n2.25% termination fee and a reduced matching period of three business days (reduced to two business days for subsequent proposals) and the\nelimination of the \u201cnaked no vote\u201d termination fee payable by the Company. In addition, Latham discussed the process for requesting a voting agreement\nfrom Standard, noting that Standard was not under a non-disclosure agreement at that time, and therefore that GCP would plan to approach Standard to\nsign a non-disclosure agreement closer to the signing of the merger agreement.\nThat evening, Party A\u2019s legal counsel sent a mark-up to the draft merger agreement to Latham together with a proposed voting agreement for each of\nStarboard and Standard. Updated terms included an increased matching period of three business days (reduced to two business days for subsequent\nproposals). Party A agreed to a termination fee of 2% of the proposed equity value for the Company, but did not accept the \u201chell or high water\u201d\ndivestiture covenant. Instead, Party A proposed it would have no obligation to divest assets that generate, in the aggregate, more than $30 million in total\nrevenues in the twelve months ended on December 31, 2020, as well as a reverse termination fee, payable if the transaction did not close due to failure to\nobtain regulatory approvals, equal to 2% of the proposed equity value of the Company. Party A noted that its reverse termination fee should be equal to\nthe termination fee payable by the Company in connection with exercise of the fiduciary out provisions. The merger agreement would not be subject to a\nfinancing condition, but Party A also added a covenant for the Company to cooperate to facilitate Party A\u2019s third party debt financing. The voting\nagreement drafts were in customary form and would terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement, but would not terminate if the Board otherwise\nchanged its recommendation without terminating the merger agreement.\nThat same evening, through email and telephonic communications, Mr. Vignial and Mr. Valente discussed the process for finalizing the merger agreement\nand other transaction documents.\nDuring the morning of December 3, 2021, the Board, along with the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Latham and RBCCM, met via\nvideoconference and discussed the status of the ongoing negotiations, as well as process and anticipated timing. Mr. Bates indicated that he expected\nSaint-Gobain to submit a revised offer on December 4, 2021. Latham reviewed the status of key legal work streams, and provided legal advice regarding\nthe revised drafts of the merger agreement submitted by Party A and Saint-Gobain. Latham also reviewed the proposed process for discussions with\nStarboard and Standard regarding the proposed voting agreements, including the process to request that Standard enter into a customary non-disclosure\nagreement with respect to those discussions. It was noted that Starboard was already subject to a non-disclosure agreement entered into in connection\nwith Mr. Feld\u2019s service on the Board. Representatives of RBCCM reviewed and provided updates with respect to their discussions with Party A and\nSaint-Gobain, including strategies to maintain competitive tension in the process, Saint-Gobain\u2019s desire to sign as quickly as possible and how best to\nelicit final proposals from each of Party A and Saint-Gobain to maximize value and certainty for the Company. The Board confirmed that it was not\nprepared to grant either Party A or Saint-Gobain exclusivity, and that the Board would provide clear messages to each party to seek their final proposals.\nThe Board instructed management, Latham and RBCCM to notify Saint-Gobain and its advisors that Saint-Gobain would need to improve the value of its\noffer significantly to remain competitive, but that the Company was willing to continue to move quickly if Saint-Gobain offered compelling value. The\nBoard also instructed management, Latham and\n43\nTable of Contents\nRBCCM, to notify Party A that, in addition to increasing its offer price, Party A needed to accelerate timing of completing definitive transaction\ndocuments and enhance the certainty of completing a proposed transaction, including by considering a \u201chell or high water\u201d provision, and obtaining\ncommitted debt financing. The Board instructed Latham to send revised draft merger agreements to the legal advisors for each of Party A and Saint-\nGobain. The Board authorized management to seek a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with Standard to facilitate discussions of a voting\nagreement between Standard and Saint-Gobain or Party A, as the case may be. In addition, the Board granted customary approvals, for purposes of\nSection 203 of the DGCL, with respect to the voting agreements proposed to be entered into by Saint Gobain and Party A, respectively, with Starboard\nand Standard such that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 would not apply by virtue of the voting agreements. The Board\nconcluded the meeting by authorizing RBCCM to use the Management Projections (for details, see \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d), which were\npreviously reviewed by the Board, for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion. Management confirmed the Management Projections\nrepresented management\u2019s best estimates as to the future financial performance of the Company at that time.\nOn December 3, 2021, Saint-Gobain submitted via email its final offer of $32.00 per share, in cash (the \u201cFinal Saint-Gobain Proposal\u201d). This email was\nfollowed by a letter from Saint-Gobain confirming the $32.00 per share, all-cash offer, and indicated that Saint-Gobain\u2019s due diligence of the Company was\ncomplete and that Saint-Gobain was prepared to sign the definitive documents. The proposal also indicated that it was subject to exclusive negotiations\nwith the Company, that the definitive agreement must be signed no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021 and that\nthe proposal represented Saint-Gobain\u2019s best and final offer.\nOn December 3, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to discuss process and timing, noting that the other bidder had revised its\noffer and now constituted the highest offer for the Company, that the other bidder was moving quickly to signing and had offered a \u201chell or high water\u201d\ncommitment with respect to antitrust and other regulatory approvals. Mr. Bates requested that Party A submit its final proposal by December 4, 2021,\nincreasing both value and certainty, as the Board was planning to meet on December 5, 2021 to review final proposals.\nOn December 3, 2021, representatives of Latham and Freshfields held a teleconference to discuss process and timing for the merger agreement, as well as\nthe process and timing for discussing voting agreements with Starboard and Standard. Separately, Mr. Valente and Mr. Vignial participated in a telephone\ncall with respect to process and timing, during which Mr. Vignial expressed Saint-Gobain\u2019s desire to sign a definitive merger agreement quickly.\nAlso on December 3, 2021, Mr. Feld, management and representatives of Latham and RBCCM held a teleconference to discuss process and timing,\nincluding how best to elicit a final proposal from Party A, in light of the Final Saint-Gobain Proposal and Saint-Gobain\u2019s statement that a definitive\nagreement must be signed no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021. The parties determined that management,\nRBCCM and Latham should reiterate to Party A the request to provide a final proposal by the end of the day on December 4, 2021, to enable the Board to\nconsider final proposals during its anticipated meeting on December 5, 2021. Latham was instructed to send an updated merger agreement draft to Party\nA\u2019s legal advisor, and request that Party A\u2019s legal advisor send a revised draft, reflecting any final comments from Party A, together with its final proposal\non December 4, 2021.\nLater that day, representatives of Latham had a teleconference with Party A\u2019s legal counsel to discuss process and timing, and provide feedback on key\nissues in the merger agreement. Latham noted that a revised merger agreement would be distributed on the morning of December 4, 2021 and emphasized\nthe need for Party A to enhance certainty in its proposal by agreeing to a \u201chell or high water\u201d provision or, if it were unable to offer such a provision, that\nParty A submit its strongest commitments with respect to antitrust issues. Latham also indicated that the process was competitive and moving quickly\nand that, to be competitive, Party A should be in a position to sign as soon as possible.\n44\nTable of Contents\nAlso on December 3, 2021, Mr. Bates had a call with representatives of Standard to request that Standard enter into a customary non-disclosure\nagreement to allow for discussions with the Company. The Company subsequently entered into a customary non-disclosure agreement with Standard.\nLater that day, Mr. Feld and Mr. Bates called the Standard representatives to advise them of the proposed transactions with Saint-Gobain and Party A,\nnoting that Saint-Gobain\u2019s proposal was currently more favorable, and conveyed the request for an agreement by Standard to vote for the proposed\ntransaction if Saint-Gobain emerged as the winner. Latham then distributed the voting agreement draft to the respective legal counsels for each of\nStarboard and Standard.\nDuring the evening of December 3, 2021, representatives of Latham and Freshfields participated in a teleconference to discuss issues related to the\nmerger agreement, including Saint-Gobain\u2019s request for a termination fee of 3.75% of the proposed transaction equity value of the Company. Shortly\nthereafter, Freshfields circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to Latham and requested a call to finalize all open issues to be in a position to\nsign as soon as possible. Latham responded that it would need to review the documents and consult with the Company, and then would be in a position\nfor a teleconference with Freshfields the next morning.\nAlso that evening, Mr. Vignial called Mr. Valente to discuss open issues with respect to the most recent revised merger agreement draft circulated from\nFreshfields to Latham.

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\nThe Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and considering various factors described in \u201c\u2014\nReasons for the Merger,\u201d unanimously (i) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger\u037e (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, including the Merger, and the Voting Agreements are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders\u037e (iii) directed\nthat the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of GCP for adoption at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) recommended that GCP\u2019s stockholders\nadopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board recommends that you vote: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation\nProposal.\nReasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting of our Board on December 5, 2021, our Board unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger\u037e (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders\u037e (iii) directed that the\nMerger Agreement be submitted to GCP\u2019s stockholders for adoption at the special meeting\u037e and (iv) recommended that GCP\u2019s stockholders adopt the\nMerger Agreement.\nIn reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by GCP\u2019s\nstockholders, the Board evaluated the Merger Agreement and the\n47Table of Contents\nMerger with GCP\u2019s management and GCP\u2019s legal and financial advisors and carefully considered a number of factors, including the following material\nfactors (which are not intended to be exhaustive or listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u25cf\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 37% over the closing price of GCP common stock on\nNovember 30, 2021, the last trading day before a media report was published speculating about a potential sale process, and (ii) a premium\nof 39% over the 30-day volume-weighted average on the same date\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the value offered to stockholders pursuant to the Merger is more favorable to GCP stockholders than the potential\nvalue from other alternatives reasonably available to GCP, including remaining an independent public company, after reviewing GCP\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, market trends, competitive landscape and execution risks, and discussions with GCP\u2019s\nmanagement and advisors and considering:\n\u25cf\nthe outlook for the industries and end markets that GCP serves\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe historical, current and prospective financial condition, results of operations and business of GCP and the execution risks and\nuncertainties associated with achieving GCP\u2019s stand-alone plan, including GCP\u2019s ability to attract and retain talent, GCP\u2019s ability to\ncompete effectively and growth given its relatively smaller scale in its geographies outside North America, and GCP\u2019s history of\nmanagement changes and the restructuring and relocation of its corporate headquarters to Alpharetta, Georgia\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe increasingly competitive nature of GCP\u2019s industry\u037e and\n\u25cf\nthe risks and uncertainties of continuing on a stand-alone basis as an independent public company.\n\u25cf\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration of $32.00 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to\nGCP\u2019s stockholders, enabling them to realize value for their interest in GCP while eliminating business and execution risk inherent in GCP\u2019s\nbusiness, including risks and uncertainties associated with achievement of the stand-alone plan\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe Board\u2019s belief that the competitive bidding process between Saint-Gobain and Party A, both highly credible strategic bidders,\npositioned GCP and its advisors to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for the proposed Merger in the interests of GCP and its\nstockholders\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe belief of the Board, based upon arms\u2019 length negotiations, including the Board\u2019s multiple requests that Parent increase its proposed\nprice per share and its responses thereto (as further described in the section titled \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d on page 34 of this proxy\nstatement), resulting in Parent\u2019s submission of what Parent referred to as its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer, that the price to be paid by Parent was\nthe highest price per share that Parent was willing to pay for GCP\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement was the product of arms\u2019 length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that are, in the\nBoard\u2019s view, advisable and favorable to GCP and its stockholders, as well as the Board\u2019s belief, based on these negotiations, that these\nare the most favorable terms available to GCP and its stockholders on which Parent was willing to transact\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe business reputation, financial wherewithal and capabilities of Saint-Gobain, including its prior track record of successfully completing\nacquisitions\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe Board\u2019s belief that Parent has access to the resources needed to complete the Merger, based on, among other factors, Saint-Gobain\u2019s\nguarantee of the performance and payment in full of all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe financial analysis presented by RBCCM and the oral opinion of RBCCM, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written\nopinion, dated December 5, 2021, to the Board, a copy of which is\n48\nTable of Contents\nattached to this proxy statement as Appendix C, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to holders of GCP common stock, as more fully described below in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of RBC Capital\nMarkets, LLC\u201d\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based upon, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the Merger,\nParent\u2019s ability to pay the Merger Consideration in cash, without the requirement for third party debt financing, the likelihood of obtaining\nrequired regulatory approvals and contractual commitments by Parent and Merger Sub to use their best efforts (including, if necessary,\nthrough litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to obtain regulatory approval for the Merger under applicable\ncompetition laws\u037e and\n\u25cf\nthe other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the following related factors:\n\u25cf\nthe customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of GCP in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to respond to a bona fide written acquisition proposal received from a third\nparty following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval if the Board determines in good\nfaith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the acquisition proposal constitutes or could\nreasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of\nadoption of the Merger Agreement in connection with the receipt of a superior proposal or the occurrence of an intervening event,\nand to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such\nsuperior proposal, subject to payment to Parent of a termination fee\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe conclusion of the Board that the termination fee and the circumstances in which such termination fee may be payable are\nreasonable in light of the benefit of the Merger and would not be a significant impediment to third parties interested in making an\nacquisition proposal\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that Parent has agreed to use its best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, including, if necessary, through litigation or the\nsale, divestiture or disposition of assets to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable competition\nand foreign investment law\u037e\n\u25cf\nParent\u2019s ability to pay the Merger Consideration in cash, without the requirement for third party debt financing\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that Saint-Gobain has guaranteed the performance and payment in full of all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant\nto the terms of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, GCP is entitled to specific performance and other equitable remedies to prevent\nbreaches of the Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, may enforce Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the\ntransactions, including the Merger, contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that the Outside Date (as it may be extended) under the Merger Agreement allows for sufficient time to complete the\nMerger\u037e and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of statutory appraisal rights to GCP stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe Board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the\nfollowing (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u25cf\nthe restrictions in the Merger Agreement on our soliciting competing bids to acquire GCP following the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe restrictions in the Merger Agreement on GCP\u2019s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement or change its recommendation in connection\nwith the receipt of a superior proposal, including the fact that the Board must (i) provide three business days\u2019 written notice to Parent of\nits intention to effect a change of board recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to provide Parent with an\nopportunity to match a superior proposal\u037e (ii) negotiate in good faith with Parent during such period, and the discouraging effect such\nrestrictions may have on other potential bidders\u037e and (iii) consider in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to the\nMerger Agreement (including a change to the price terms thereof) and other agreements contemplated thereby that were irrevocably\nproposed in writing by Parent no later than 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the last day of such three business day notice period\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that, under certain circumstances in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement (including if the Board changes its\nrecommendation in light of a superior proposal or intervening event or if GCP terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior\nproposal), GCP will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $71.0 million, and the potential effect of such termination fee to\ndiscourage other potential bidders from making an acquisition proposal for GCP\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that, if the Merger is completed, GCP stockholders would not have the opportunity to participate in the future performance of our\nassets, earnings growth and appreciation of the value of GCP common stock\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger and the substantial time and effort of\nmanagement required to complete the Merger and related disruptions to the operation of our business\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied and, as a result, the possibility that the Merger may\nnot be completed in a timely manner or at all, even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by GCP\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe potential negative effects if the Merger is not consummated, including:\n\u25cf\nthe trading price of GCP common stock could be adversely affected\u037e\n\u25cf\nwe will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs attempting to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u25cf\nwe could lose customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, including key executives, sales and other personnel\u037e\n\u25cf\nour business may be subject to significant disruption and decline\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe market\u2019s perceptions of our prospects could be adversely affected\u037e and\n\u25cf\nour directors, officers and other employees will have expended considerable time and efforts to consummate the Merger\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe fact that any gain realized by GCP stockholders as a result of the Merger will generally be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nto those stockholders that are U.S. persons subject to taxation in the United States\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or\nprevent us from undertaking business or other opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the Merger\u037e\n50\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nthe potential distraction to our business from stockholder lawsuits in connection with the Merger\u037e and\n\u25cf\nthe fact that our executive officers and directors may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of\nGCP stockholders. See \u201c\u2014Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger\u201d on page 60 of this proxy statement.\nAfter taking into account the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger to GCP\u2019s\nstockholders outweighed the potentially negative factors associated with the Merger. Accordingly, the Board unanimously determined that the Merger\nAgreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of GCP and its stockholders and recommends that the stockholders of GCP\napprove and adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe foregoing discussion summarizes the material factors considered by the Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors\nconsidered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative\nweights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her\nown business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific\ndetermination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination and\nrecommendation. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including its discussions with GCP\u2019s executive\nmanagement and its financial advisors and outside legal counsel. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in\nthis section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking\nStatements\u201d on page 30 of this proxy statement.",

After giving effect to these adjustments, the financial projections provided to Saint-Gobain and Party\nA showed, for fiscal year 2021 (in millions), Net Revenue of $965, Adjusted Gross Profit of $347, Adjusted EBIT of $93 and Adjusted EBITDA of $139.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow calculated by RBCCM was not provided to Saint-Gobain and Party A.\n58Table of Contents\nGCP\u2019s ability to achieve the results set forth in the Management Projections are expressly dependent upon certain assumptions, including with respect to\nbroad trends in the construction chemicals and building materials industries and the continued impact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply\nchain disruptions. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included herein only because such\ninformation was made available as described above. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to comply with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.\nFurthermore, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied\nprocedures to the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for them and expresses no opinion on them. The Management\nProjections included herein have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, GCP\u2019s management.\nAlthough a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections reflect numerous variables,\nassumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the Management\nProjections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to the Company\u2019s management at the time the Management Projections\nwere prepared. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important\nfactors that may cause actual results to deviate from the Management Projections include general economic conditions, results or financial condition,\nindustry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the continued\nimpact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions, accuracy of certain industry forecasts prepared by third parties,\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting our results, our contingent liabilities and tax matters\ncausing us to incur losses or costs, any inability to protect our intellectual property rights adversely affecting our business or our competitive position,\ncosts or adverse effects on our business, reputation or results from governmental regulations, failure to hire and retain employees, results or financial\ncondition, and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nthe Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Management Projections.\nSince the Management Projections cover multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The inclusion\nof this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, GCP, our financial advisor or Saint-Gobain, or any of their respective\nrepresentatives and affiliates, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be material\ninformation of GCP or that actual future results will necessarily reflect the Management Projections, and the Management Projections should not be relied\nupon as such. The summary of the Management Projections is not included herein to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or\nany of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the\nMerger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to shares of GCP common stock.\nThe Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other information\nregarding GCP contained in our public filings with the SEC. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d on page 119 of this proxy statement.\nThe Management Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause GCP\u2019s future results to materially vary, see\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 30 of this proxy statement.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise\nrevise the Management Projections to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even if the\nassumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error. By including in this proxy statement a summary of certain\n59\nTable of Contents\nfinancial projections, neither GCP nor any of its representatives or advisors, nor Saint-Gobain or any of its representatives and affiliates, makes any\nrepresentation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of GCP compared to the information contained in such financial projections and should\nnot be read to do so.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on the\nManagement Projections included herein.\nCertain of the measures included in the Management Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as used by GCP may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.",

The Board was\naware of these interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be\nadopted by the stockholders of GCP. See \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d and \u201c\u2014Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the\nMerger\u201d on pages 34 and 47 of this proxy statement, respectively. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\napproval of the Merger Agreement.\nThese interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them, including the compensation that may become payable in connection with the\nMerger to Messrs. Bates, Merrill, Holland, Thompson, and Van Lent, who constitute our named executive officers, are subject to a non-binding, advisory\nvote of the stockholders of GCP and are quantified in the narrative below and in \u201cProposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer\nCompensation\u201d on page 112 of this proxy statement.

The performance criteria for PBUs granted in 2020\nand 2019 are tied to the Company\u2019s achievement of adjusted diluted earnings per share and relative total shareholder return, measured over a three\nyear period. PBUs granted in 2019 have been excluded from the table as the Company expects the performance criteria for these awards will not be\nattained and they will be forfeited in accordance with their terms prior to the closing of the Merger.\n(5)\nIn the case of Company PBUs, the amount reported assumes payout based on the target level of achievement as set forth in the applicable award\nagreement. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding award of Company PBUs that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions\nwill become vested as to the greater of the number of shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (x) the target level of\nachievement and (y) the Company\u2019s actual level of achievement.\n(6)\nRepresents award of an option to purchase 388,348 shares of GCP common stock issued to Mr. Bates under the Inducement Plan in connection with\nthe start of his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the \u201cBates Inducement Option\u201d).

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nGeneral\nIf the Merger is completed, holders of shares of GCP common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly\ndemand an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal\nrights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and\nproperly comply with such statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.\nThis section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a full summary\nof the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is\nattached as Appendix B to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262 of the DGCL to \u201cstockholder\u201d are\nto the record holder of shares of GCP common stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a\nrecommendation as to whether or not a GCP stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of GCP common stock, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, continuously are\nthe record holder of such shares through the effective date of the Merger and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the\nDGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive the \u201cfair value\u201d of such shares (as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\n69Table of Contents\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger) in cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. It is\npossible that any such \u201cfair value\u201d as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration\nwhich GCP stockholders will be entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as\nappraisal rights.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the special meeting at which the adoption of the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the\nstockholders, GCP must notify each stockholder who was a GCP stockholder on the Record Date and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that\nappraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the required notice, and a\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement.\nA HOLDER OF GCP COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO\nSHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND APPENDIX B CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES\nOF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE\nCOMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF GCP\nCOMMON STOCK WHO IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN\nLEGAL COUNSEL. ANY SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK HELD BY A GCP STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT, SUCCESSFULLY\nWITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AS OF THE\nEFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nHow to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights\nIf you are a GCP stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of GCP common stock, you must comply with ALL of the\nfollowing:\n\u25cf\nyou must NOT vote \u201cFOR,\u201d or otherwise consent in writing to, the Merger Proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but\ndoes not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and\nwish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share \u201cAGAINST,\u201d or as an abstention with\nrespect to, the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u25cf\nyou must continuously hold your shares of GCP common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the\nMerger. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer your shares of GCP common stock before the effective date of the Merger\u037e\n\u25cf\nprior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, if you are a holder of record, you must deliver a proper\nwritten demand for appraisal of your shares, and if you are a beneficial holder, the bank, broker or other nominee that holds shares on your\nbehalf must deliver a proper written demand for appraisal of the shares you hold beneficially\u037e and\n\u25cf\nyou, another stockholder, an appropriate beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or the\nSurviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of\nGCP common stock within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any\nsuch petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of GCP stockholders to\ninitiate all necessary action to properly demand their appraisal rights in respect of shares of GCP common stock within the time prescribed\nin Section 262 of the DGCL.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFiling a Written Demand\nNeither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal, will in and of itself constitute a written\ndemand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. A record holder of shares of GCP common stock wishing to exercise\nappraisal rights must deliver to GCP, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the\nstockholder\u2019s shares. A stockholder\u2019s failure to deliver the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting\nwill constitute a waiver of appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger\nProposal.\nA demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may demand appraisal rights for the shares\nof GCP common stock registered in that holder\u2019s name. Such demand will be not be sufficient unless it reasonably informs GCP of the identity of the\nstockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of his, her or its shares of GCP common stock. Beneficial owners who\ndo not also hold their shares of GCP common stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to GCP. The beneficial owner must, in such case,\narrange for the holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of GCP common\nstock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of GCP common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of GCP common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other\nbeneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of GCP common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of\nshares of GCP common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of GCP common stock held in the name of the\nholder of record.\nIF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH\nTO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A\nBENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE\nOR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER\nTHE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK\nOR BROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY\nTRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND\nMUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.\nIf your shares of GCP common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand for\nappraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are owned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy\nin common, the demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more\njoint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and\nexpressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their\nshares of GCP common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their\nbrokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.\n71\nTable of Contents\nIf you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:\nGCP Applied Technologies Inc.\n2325 Lakeview Parkway\nAlpharetta, Georgia 30009\nAttention: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, any GCP stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration\nin accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of GCP common stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal\nof the demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, GCP, as the Surviving Corporation, must notify each holder of\nGCP common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal\nof the date that the Merger has become effective.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not later, a stockholder\nof record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal, or the Surviving Corporation may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed\nby a record or beneficial holder, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of GCP common stock held by all stockholders who have properly\ndemanded appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or GCP, as the Surviving Corporation is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any\nintention to do so. If you desire to have your shares of GCP common stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for properly demanding\nyour appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to\nreceive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of GCP common stock not voted\nin favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which GCP has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares.\nThe Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) ten days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request\ntherefor or (ii) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock\nheld in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition and request from the Surviving Corporation\nthe statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation,\nthen the right to appraisal will cease.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated,\nwithin 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Court of Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of GCP common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares\nof GCP common stock have not been reached by the Surviving Corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by\nregistered or certified mail to the Surviving\n72\nTable of Contents\nCorporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is\nempowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which GCP stockholders have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have become\nentitled to appraisal rights and may require the GCP stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of GCP common stock to submit their\nstock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may\ndismiss the proceedings as to any GCP stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at\nleast 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nand the costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. In addition, assuming common stock of GCP remains listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders\nof such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of GCP common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%\nof the outstanding shares of GCP common stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of GCP\ncommon stock exceeds $1.0 million.\nThe appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of GCP common\nstock held by all GCP stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the\neffective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that\ntime. Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the\nRegister in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to\nappraisal. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the GCP\nstockholders entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the\nSurviving Corporation of their stock certificates.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated\nthat, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other factors which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects\nof the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot\n73\nTable of Contents\nencompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or\nexpectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature\nof the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d An\nopinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to fair\nvalue under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of GCP common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than,\nthe same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor GCP, as the Surviving Corporation, anticipates offering more than the Merger\nConsideration to any GCP stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of GCP common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No representation is made as to the\noutcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, you will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive\nthe Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a\nstockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of GCP\ncommon stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and after the effective date of the Merger, be\nentitled to vote the shares of GCP common stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares,\nexcept dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of GCP common stock as of a record date prior to the effective date of the Merger.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept\nthe Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to\nthe Surviving Corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the Merger will require written approval\nof the Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the\napproval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided,\nhowever, that this provision will not affect the right of any GCP stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the\nMerger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or\notherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of GCP common stock will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective date of the Merger into\nthe right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In\nthat event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of GCP common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL\nPREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU\n74\nTable of Contents\nWISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE\nANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as\ndefined below) of shares of GCP common stock who receive cash in exchange for such shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger. This\ndiscussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. The\ntax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable\nstate, local and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the\nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue\nService (the \u201cIRS\u201d), in each case, in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations,\nand any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions\nset forth in this summary. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to\nseek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. There can be no assurance the\nIRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.\nThis discussion is limited to holders of shares of GCP common stock who hold such shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a\nholder in light of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to\nholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u25cf\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u25cf\nU.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u25cf\npersons holding shares of GCP common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion\ntransaction or other integrated investment\u037e\n\u25cf\nbanks, insurance companies and other financial institutions\u037e\n\u25cf\nbrokers or dealers in securities\u037e\n\u25cf\ntraders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of tax accounting\u037e\n\u25cf\n\u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.\nfederal income tax\u037e\n\u25cf\n\u201cS corporations,\u201d partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other\npass-through entities (and investors therein)\u037e\n\u25cf\nreal estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies\u037e\n\u25cf\ntax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations\u037e\n75Table of Contents\n\u25cf\npersons deemed to sell their shares of GCP common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code\u037e\n\u25cf\npersons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation\u037e\n\u25cf\npersons who hold or received their shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as\ncompensation\u037e\n\u25cf\ntax-qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts\u037e and\n\u25cf\n\u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by qualified\nforeign pension funds.\nThis discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of GCP common stock who exercise appraisal rights\nin connection with the Merger under the DGCL.\nIf an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of GCP common stock, the U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations\nmade at the partner level.\nAccordingly, partnerships holding shares of GCP common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their own tax advisors regarding the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE. HOLDERS OF SHARES OF GCP COMMON\nSTOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE\nMERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING\nUNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, OR\nUNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is\ntreated as:\n\u25cf\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u25cf\na corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the\nDistrict of Columbia\u037e\n\u25cf\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u25cf\na trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of Section\n7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a\n\u201cUnited States person\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for shares of GCP common stock in the Merger\nwill generally equal\n76\nTable of Contents\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the\nU.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for\nsuch share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be determined separately for each block of shares of GCP\ncommon stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S.\nholder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the Effective Time. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss which is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-\ncorporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nA surtax of up to 3.8% may apply to so-called \u201cnet investment income\u201d of certain U.S. citizens or residents, and to undistributed \u201cnet investment income\u201d\nof certain estates and trusts. Net investment income includes any gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP common stock\npursuant to the Merger. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of the surtax on gain recognized pursuant to the\nMerger.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS\nand backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an\nexemption should complete and return to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying (1) that such\nholder is a U.S. person, (2) that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and (3) that such holder is not subject to backup withholding.\nCertain U.S. holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup\nwithholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any\u037e provided, the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup\nwithholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nTax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a Non-U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or\narrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEffect of the Merger\nA non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP\ncommon stock in the Merger unless:\n\u25cf\nthe gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,\nmaintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States)\u037e\n77\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition of shares of GCP common stock in the Merger, and certain other requirements are met\u037e or\n\u25cf\nGCP is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the\nshorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of GCP common stock,\nand the non-U.S. holder held (actually or constructively) more than five percent of the total fair market value of all shares of GCP common\nstock at any time during such applicable period.\nGain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal\nincome tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax\ntreaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in\nthe U.S. business.\nGain described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified\nunder an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not\nconsidered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, the determination of whether GCP is a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of its U.S. real property\ninterests relative to the fair market value of its other trade or business assets and its United States and foreign real property interests. GCP believes that it\nhas not been a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes during the five-year period preceding the Merger.\nNon-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made to non-U.S. holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%).\nNon-U.S. holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the paying agent with an applicable and properly\nexecuted IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder\u2019s non-U.S.\nstatus (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person as defined\nunder the Code) or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an\napplicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a\nnon-U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE\nDESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES\nONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT\nTHEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED ABOVE TO THE HOLDER AND THE\nPARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS TO THE HOLDER OF THE MERGER IN\n78\nTable of Contents\nLIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL\nESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES, OR THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY\nAPPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nGCP and Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all regulatory\napprovals required to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals\ninclude the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the\n\u201cHSR Act\u201d) and clearance of the Merger having been granted under the antitrust and/or foreign investment laws, as applicable, of the European Union,\nthe United Kingdom, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Russia and Serbia. Parent has agreed to use its best efforts (including, if necessary,\nthrough litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable\ncompetition and foreign investment law. Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you\nthat these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals\nwill not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or will not require\nchanges to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nParent, in its good faith reasonable discretion, has the right to take reasonable periods of time in order to advocate and negotiate with third parties and\ngovernmental entities with respect to its obligations to take certain actions under the Merger Agreement in order to obtain approvals under competition\nand foreign investment laws, provided that such periods of time do not prevent the parties from consummating the Merger by no later than the Outside\nDate. In addition, none of GCP, Parent or their respective affiliates is required to agree to take or enter into any such action that is not conditioned upon\nconsummation of the Merger.\nParent is entitled to: (i) control and lead all communications, meetings, negotiations and strategy for dealing with any governmental entity and (ii) control\nand lead the defense strategy for dealing with any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging\nthe Merger Agreement by any governmental entity or relates to any competition laws. However, Parent is required to consult in good faith with GCP in\nconnection with such control and leadership by Parent and that such control and leadership do not prevent the consummation of the Merger by the\nOutside Date.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the Merger cannot be completed until GCP and\nParent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act\nand the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC\nor the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or termination\nof the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private\nparties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\n79Table of Contents\nEuropean Commission Antitrust Approval\nBoth GCP and Parent operate in the European Union. While the Merger is not reportable to the European Union as a single review under the primary or\nalternative jurisdictional thresholds, because the Merger is reportable under the merger control rules of at least three EU Member States, the Merger is\neligible for a referral of jurisdiction to review the Merger from the relevant Member States to the European Commission (the \u201cEC\u201d) at the parties\u2019 request\nunder Article 4(5) of Council Regulation 139/2004 (the \u201cEU Merger Regulation\u201d). To request the EC to review the merger, Parent and GCP must first submit\nto the EC a reasoned submission (through a so-called Form RS) explaining why it is objectively preferable for the EC to take sole jurisdiction over the\nmerger control review in the European Union. After submission of the Form RS, if no EU Member State with jurisdiction to review the Merger has\nexpressed, within 15 working days from the date of submission of the Form RS, its objections to the EC taking on jurisdiction to review the Merger,\njurisdiction for reviewing the Merger will pass exclusively to the EC. The parties will then begin a process of pre-notification prior to proceeding with a\nformal notification to the EC. The pre-notification is not technically mandatory but it is required in practice and there is no regulatory deadline for this\nperiod. Once the Merger is formally notified to the EC (through a so-called Form CO), the EC has 25 working days (beginning on the first business day\nfollowing the date on which a complete formal notification is received by the EC), which period may be extended to 35 working days if the parties offer\nremedies by Day 15 at the latest, to issue a decision as to whether to clear the Offer and the Merger or to initiate an in-depth (so called \u201cPhase II\u201d)\ninvestigation. The EC will initiate a Phase II investigation if it finds that the Merger gives rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the EU internal\nmarket. If the EC initiates a Phase II investigation, it has 90 working days following the decision to open a Phase II investigation, which period may be\nextended by up to 35 working days under certain circumstances, to decide whether to declare the Merger compatible with the EU internal market\n(unconditionally or subject to remedies) or to prohibit its implementation. The EC also has the power to suspend the timetable for a Phase II review in\ncircumstances where the parties have failed to comply with a statutory request for information from the EC in a full or timely manner.\nUK Antitrust Approval\nUnder the Enterprise Act 2002, as amended by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (the \u201cEnterprise Act\u201d), notification of the Merger to the\nCompetition and Markets Authority (the \u201cCMA\u201d) is voluntary even where the relevant jurisdictional thresholds are met, meaning that the parties can\ncomplete and implement a transaction without notifying and obtaining prior clearance of the CMA. In the case at hand, the parties have decided to make\na voluntary notification with the CMA. Under the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is conditioned upon receipt of approval from the CMA in\nresponse to the voluntary notification.\nPrior to the formal submission of a merger notice, the parties are strongly advised to initiate pre-notification discussions with the case team. There is no\nregulatory deadline for this period. Once the formal filing is made, the CMA must make a decision within 40 working days after the CMA confirms that\neither the merger notice is complete or it has received sufficient information to enable it to begin its investigation (\u201cCMA Phase 1\u201d). There is no provision\nfor formally extending the CMA Phase 1 review period, although the CMA has the power to suspend the review in circumstances where the parties have\nfailed to comply with a statutory request for information from the CMA in full or in a timely manner. The 40-working day limit can also be extended by up\nto 90 working days from the date of the CMA Phase 1 decision if undertakings in lieu of a reference to CMA Phase 2 are accepted in CMA Phase 1.\nIf the CMA is of the view that there is a realistic prospect that the Merger could result in a substantial lessening of competition (\u201cSLC\u201d), the CMA,\nsubject to very limited exceptions, would have a duty to refer the transaction for an in depth second phase investigation. The CMA has 24 weeks\n(extendable by up to a further 8 weeks) (\u201cCMA Phase 2\u201d) from the date of referral to CMA Phase 2 to investigate and make its final decision although as\nwith Phase 1, the CMA has the power to suspend the review in circumstances where the parties have failed to comply with a statutory request for\ninformation from the CMA in full or in a timely manner. The CMA\n80\nTable of Contents\nPhase 2 investigation can be suspended for up to three weeks at the parties\u2019 request if the CMA reasonably believes that the Merger may be abandoned\nby the merger parties. If the CMA concludes at the end of CMA Phase 2 that the Merger may be expected to result in an SLC, it may take action for the\npurpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC, including prohibiting the Merger or conditionally approving the completion of the Merger.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nCompletion of the transaction is further subject to the receipt of additional clearances and/or approval under the antitrust and/or foreign investment laws\nof Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Russia and Serbia.\n81\nTable of Contents",

or made available to Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent it has not been provided or made\navailable already), as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than 48 hours) after it is

Without limiting the foregoing, GCP will as promptly as\npracticable (and in any event within 48 hours of such determination) advise Parent if GCP determines to begin providing information or to engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The foregoing obligations of GCP also apply with\nrespect to any amended, revised or subsequent acquisition proposal.

or form of consideration or any other material terms or conditions of such acquisition proposal, GCP is required\nto deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with all of its obligations set forth in the no shop restrictions of the Merger Agreement with\nrespect to such new written notice, except that the notice period with respect to such revision shall be two business days rather than three business\ndays.\nIn response to an intervening event prior to the receipt of the company stockholder approval, the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may\neffect a

Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the\ndate of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the\noffer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or\nresulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic\ntransmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will\nbe sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand\nthe appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not\nB-2\nTable of Contents\nnotify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second\nnotice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such\nconstituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or\nresulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however,\nthat if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant\nto \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the\nsending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has\ndemanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the\ntransfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be\nprima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each\nconstituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,\nthat if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no\nrecord date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next\npreceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e)\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied\nwith subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by\nfiling a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has\ncomplied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission\ndirected to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive\nfrom the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in\nfavor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other\nthan any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or\nexchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the\naggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for\nsuch a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for\nappraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the\nbeneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file\na petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which\nshall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares\nhave not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition\nshall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed\nfor the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at\nthe addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\nB-3\nTable of Contents\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or\nsuch publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs\nthereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to\nappraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if\nany stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger\nor consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the\nvalue of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was\napproved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the\nfair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together\nwith interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all\nrelevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger\nand the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,\nunless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an\nappraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the\nstockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the\ncase of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s\ndecree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a\ncorporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon\napplication of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value\nof all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\nB-4\nTable of Contents\n(k)\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)\nof this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except\ndividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e\nprovided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder\nshall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the\nmerger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or\nthereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand\nfor appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,\nas set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l)\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they\nassented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-5\nTable of Contents\nAppendix C",

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party will be\ncumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at Law, or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of\nany one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not\nperformed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist\nand damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this\nAgreement by the other party and to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law\nor in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or\ninjunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and the necessity of\nproving actual harm or damages. The Company\u2019s or Parent\u2019s pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or\nwaiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or\ndamages incurred or suffered by the other party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful and Material Breach. If Parent has\ncommitted a Willful and Material Breach of its obligation to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date and, prior to the termination of this Agreement,\nthe Company has sought an order of specific performance from a court of competent jurisdiction to cause Parent to comply with its obligation to\nconsummate the Merger and such court has determined that the remedy of specific performance is unavailable to cause Parent to comply with its\nobligation to consummate the Merger, then, following termination of this Agreement, the remedy of monetary damages (if any) may take into account the\nlost benefit of the bargain\u037e provided however, that, in the case of the grant of any monetary award by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of the\nCompany as a result of a Willful and Material Breach by Parent of its obligation to consummate the Merger, the Company may enforce such award and\naccept such monetary payment only if, following such grant of monetary award, the Company shall have offered and committed to complete the Merger\nand Parent and Merger Sub shall have not consummated the Merger within two (2) weeks of such offer\u037e provided further that, the Company shall, and\nshall cause its Representatives to, dismiss with prejudice any Proceedings still pending at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger.",
