This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or\nother tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal\ntax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you\nof the merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock is required\nto adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or\nrepresented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of\neach of the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed\nproxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting\u201d)\u037e or (iii) vote\nvirtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\nbut, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment\nProposal. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to\ninstruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal, the\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the\nCompensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the\nboxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed\nproxy will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n(3) \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nstockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of TEGNA common stock. Instead, TEGNA will remain\nan independent public company, TEGNA common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, TEGNA will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $163 million, upon the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Termination Fees.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require TEGNA to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote\nwith respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with\nthe Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on TEGNA. Therefore, if the\napproval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable\nunder the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to TEGNA\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects\nyou.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of TEGNA\u2019s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of\nDirectors and TEGNA\u2019s senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, regularly reviews,\nconsiders and assesses TEGNA\u2019s strategic alternatives. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration\nof potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives. The\nBoard of Directors has also regularly engaged with TEGNA stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on\nits strategic and financial direction. To assist in these evaluations, TEGNA regularly consults with J.P. Morgan and\nGreenhill, its financial advisors, and other strategic advisors, as well as with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz\n(\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) and Covington & Burling LLP (\u201cCovington\u201d), its legal advisors.\nIn August 2019, Standard General filed a beneficial ownership report on Schedule 13G with the SEC, reporting\nbeneficial ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.2% of TEGNA common stock. Subsequently, in\nSeptember 2019, Standard General filed a beneficial ownership report on Schedule 13D (the \u201cSchedule 13D\u201d) with the\nSEC, reporting beneficial ownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.8% of TEGNA common stock and\ndisclosing an intent to \u201cbecome actively engaged\u201d with TEGNA.\nBetween October and December 2019, members of the Board of the Directors and members of senior management\nengaged in discussions and interviews with Mr. Kim, covering matters relating to corporate strategy, governance and\nstockholder engagement and Mr. Kim\u2019s request for a seat on the Board of Directors. Following these discussions, the\nBoard of Directors determined that it would not be advisable for Mr. Kim to be appointed to the Board of Directors at\nthis time, in part because of the Board of Directors\u2019 view, in accordance with TEGNA\u2019s Ethics Policy, that Mr. Kim had\nconflicts of interest due to his and Standard General\u2019s affiliation with Standard Media Group and MediaCo Holding,\ntwo companies in the broadcasting industry.\nBetween January and April 2020, Standard General nominated four individuals - including Mr. Kim and Deborah\nMcDermott, the Chief Executive Officer of Standard Media - to the Board of Directors, and ran a proxy contest in\nconnection with such nominations.\nOn January 15, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.7% of TEGNA common stock.\nOn February 20, 2020, TEGNA received an informal, verbal offer from Party A, a broadcasting industry participant, to\npotentially acquire TEGNA for $18.50 in cash and $1.50 in shares of Party A common stock, subject to due diligence.\nThereafter, the Board of Directors discussed this proposal with members of TEGNA senior management and financial\nand legal advisors, and authorized management and advisors to enter discussions with Party A, including to\nnegotiate a non-disclosure agreement to facilitate Party A\u2019s due diligence review of TEGNA.\nFollowing various preliminary discussions over the prior year regarding the exploration of possible transactions,\nincluding a possible combination of certain assets, between representatives of TEGNA and Apollo, on February 24,\n2020, TEGNA entered into a reciprocal non-disclosure agreement with an affiliate of Apollo,\n28TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich contained a customary standstill restriction that allowed Apollo to submit confidential proposals to the Chief\nExecutive Officer or Chairman of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, TEGNA and Apollo provided due diligence\ninformation to each other.\nOn February 28, 2020, TEGNA entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Party A, which contained a customary\nstandstill restriction with a customary \u201cfall-away provision\u201d that allowed Party A to submit confidential proposals to\nthe Board of Directors. Thereafter, TEGNA provided non-public due diligence information to Party A and engaged in\nfurther discussions with Party A regarding a potential transaction.\nOn March 1, 2020, the Board of Directors held a meeting during which representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill\nsummarized Party A\u2019s proposal, including the proposed purchase price. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill\nalso reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of its preliminary valuation analyses, including based on\nmanagement\u2019s financial projections using a range of different assumptions, and answered questions from the\ndirectors regarding the valuation analyses and management\u2019s projections that were used as part of the analyses. In\naddition, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill provided the Board of Directors with a summary of Party A\u2019s\nbusiness and financial profile. Also during the meeting, the Board of Directors discussed TEGNA\u2019s standalone\nprospects and strategic plans, and provided guidance to management and the financial advisors with respect to\ndiscussions with Party A.\nOn March 4, 2020, TEGNA received a revised proposal from Party A for a potential acquisition of TEGNA for $18.75 in\ncash and $1.30 in shares of Party A common stock, subject to continued due diligence. The proposal stated that\ncommitted debt financing would be provided by a specific financial institution and commitment letters were provided\nto TEGNA in connection with such proposal.\nOn March 6, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Apollo in which Apollo offered to acquire TEGNA for\n$20.00 per share in cash, with 100% of the equity financing to be provided by Apollo and debt financing to be\nprovided by internationally recognized leading financial institutions.\nOn March 7, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Apollo, in which Apollo stated that it appreciated the information\nthat had been shared since the non-disclosure agreement was executed on February 24, 2020, and based on the due\ndiligence information received, including during calls with members of TEGNA\u2019s management, Apollo was highly\nconfident that it could materially increase the proposed purchase price if given more access to due diligence\ninformation.\nOn March 11, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Party B, a broadcasting industry participant, to acquire\nTEGNA for $20.00 in cash per share, subject to completion of confirmatory due diligence. The proposal letter\nindicated that Party B had identified 100% of the financing sources to support its proposal. However, the letter did\nnot disclose any information about the identity or type of these financing sources. Thereafter, TEGNA\u2019s senior\nmanagement and financial advisors discussed with Party B its financing and acquisition structure and indicated to\nParty B that TEGNA was willing to transact at the right price and was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure\nagreement and provide non-public due diligence information if Party B could provide sufficient information regarding\nits ability to finance the proposed acquisition of TEGNA.\nOn March 12, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Apollo, in which Apollo reaffirmed its offer to acquire TEGNA for\n$20.00 per share in cash. The proposal letter also included additional diligence requests that Apollo stated could\nallow Apollo to increase the proposed purchase price. During the next two weeks, representatives of TEGNA\ncontinued to provide Apollo with due diligence information and held a number of discussions with representatives of\nApollo. As a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, representatives of Apollo communicated to representatives\nof TEGNA that the equity and debt markets were experiencing significant dislocations and therefore Apollo would\nnot pursue an acquisition of TEGNA at this time.\nOn March 17, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal letter from Party C, a consortium consisting of a private investment\nfirm and a broadcasting industry participant, to jointly acquire TEGNA for $20.00 per share, subject to due diligence.\nThe proposal letter indicated that the parties would obtain a commitment for all sources of financing and would utilize\nits existing lender relationships to obtain committed debt financing, but the letter did not otherwise provide any\ninformation on the specific equity or debt financing sources. Representatives of TEGNA discussed this proposal with\nrepresentatives of Party C but did not obtain any more specific information about Party C\u2019s financing sources.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThroughout March 2020, the Board of Directors held a number of discussions, including with members of senior\nmanagement and financial and legal advisors, regarding the proposals received from and subsequent discussions\nwith Party A, Party B, Party C and Apollo, as well as TEGNA\u2019s financial performance, standalone plan and the\nchanging market, financial and business environments, including as a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlso during this period, TEGNA\u2019s senior management and financial advisors discussed the proposals and feedback\non the proposals with each of the interested parties.\nOn March 21, 2020, TEGNA received a letter from Party A, in which Party A stated that given the then-current\neconomic upheaval, the dislocation in the capital markets, and the uncertainty as to the impact that these recent\ndevelopments will have on both businesses, Party A was not going to engage with TEGNA on deal discussions at\nthis time.\nOn March 29, 2020, TEGNA issued a press release stating that TEGNA had received four unsolicited acquisition\nproposals in recent weeks and that TEGNA and its advisors engaged substantially with two of these parties and\nprovided them extensive non-public due diligence information. The press release further stated that these two parties\nmade their proposals shortly before the recent market dislocation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and both\nsubsequently informed TEGNA that they were ceasing discussions, and that the other two parties had not signed\nconfidentiality agreements to enable due diligence and have not delivered any information on financing sources.\nAlso, in the press release, Howard D. Elias, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, among other things, that the\nBoard of Directors has been, and remains, willing to consider transactions that create compelling value.\nOn April 3, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 11.8% of TEGNA common stock.\nAt the annual meeting of TEGNA stockholders held on April 30, 2020, none of Standard General\u2019s nominees were\nelected to the Board of Directors.\nOn June 4, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.9% of TEGNA common stock.\nOn June 11, 2020, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 8.1% of TEGNA common stock.\nDuring the summer and fall of 2020, members of senior management and advisors of TEGNA continued to have\nperiodic informal discussions with representatives of Apollo and Party A regarding potential transactions, and\nmembers of senior management and advisors discussed these interactions with the Board of Directors, and also\ndiscussed with the Board of Directors the financing market, acquisition rumors, potential valuations and the\nregulatory environment. In addition, during this period, the Board of Directors continued to discuss TEGNA\u2019s\nfinancial performance, standalone plan and prospects and the changing market, financial and business environments,\nincluding as to the significant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn October 13, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal from Apollo to acquire TEGNA for $16.00 in cash, subject to due\ndiligence.\nAt a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 27 and 28, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and\nreviewed, together with J.P. Morgan, Greenhill and Wachtell Lipton, Apollo\u2019s proposal. Representatives of the\nfinancial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of the financial projections for TEGNA prepared\nby management at the direction of the Board of Directors to assist the Board of Directors in its review of a potential\ntransaction involving TEGNA. The forecasted financial information included management\u2019s base case projections, as\nwell as an optimistic sensitivity case and a pessimistic sensitivity case that TEGNA management believed was\nimportant to include given the heightened levels of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board of\nDirectors discussed TEGNA\u2019s financial performance and standalone plan and the assumptions underlying the\ndifferent cases of projections that management prepared, including in the context of the historical and most recent\nrevenue and EBITDA trends for TEGNA, economic recovery from COVID-19, as well as industry changes and the\nregulatory environment. The financial advisors also reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of preliminary\nvaluation analyses, including an analysis based on the different cases, and discussed with the Board of Directors\nApollo\u2019s possible valuation methodology and the possible rationale behind the timing of the Apollo proposal and the\nproposed consideration. Also during this meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of\nDirectors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconnection with the Apollo proposal. Following further discussion regarding possible responses to Apollo, whether\nor not to approach other possible acquirers, the risk of leaks, regulatory considerations and risks inherent in a\ntransaction with Apollo and other parties, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the media industry and the\npotential for continuing consolidation in the broadcast industry, the Board of Directors then authorized management\nto communicate to Apollo that the proposed consideration was insufficient, but that TEGNA was willing to engage\nand possibly provide additional due diligence materials to assist them in increasing the value of their proposal. The\nBoard of Directors also authorized management to reach out to Party A and certain other potential counterparties to\nassess their interest in a potential transaction with TEGNA.\nThereafter, Dave Lougee, the Chief Executive Officer of TEGNA, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill\ninformed a representative of Apollo that its last offer was not sufficient, but that TEGNA was willing to provide\nadditional due diligence materials to assist them in increasing the value of their proposal. In addition, Mr. Lougee\ncontacted representatives of Party A and Mr. Elias contacted representatives of Party D (a broadcasting industry\nparticipant) to assess their respective interest in a potential acquisition of, or business combination with, TEGNA.\nParty A declined to further pursue a transaction with TEGNA at this time that involved a complete sale of TEGNA,\nand Party D also declined to engage with TEGNA.\nDuring November 2020, Party A\u2019s advisors continued to have discussions with TEGNA\u2019s advisors regarding\nregulatory considerations relating to a transaction, with representatives of Party A noting that despite Party A\u2019s\nunwillingness to make a strong commitment to obtain regulatory approval, Party A was still interested in a potential\ntransaction of some variety, and the parties continued to discuss possible alternative transaction structures.\nOn November 2, 2020, TEGNA received a revised proposal from Apollo to acquire TEGNA at a price range of $16.50 to\n$18.00 per share. The proposal letter also indicated that if Apollo were to receive access to targeted due diligence\ninformation, they were confident that they could deliver a highly compelling proposal to TEGNA stockholders. Mr.\nLougee informed the Board of Directors of this revised proposal and thereafter communicated to representatives of\nApollo that the Board of Directors would consider it at its next meeting.\nAt a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on November 10, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and\nreviewed, together with its financial and legal advisors, the latest proposal from Apollo. Representatives of the\nfinancial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of a preliminary valuation analyses, and discussed\nthe inputs of their analyses and related considerations. Also during this meeting, representatives of Wachtell Lipton\ndiscussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in connection with the\nApollo proposal. Members of the Board of Directors provided guidance to senior management and TEGNA\u2019s\nadvisors with respect to the continued discussions with Apollo, which was thereafter communicated to Apollo,\nincluding that Apollo\u2019s latest proposal was inadequate.\nOn December 7, 2020, TEGNA received a proposal from Party A to acquire TEGNA\u2019s station assets in fourteen\nspecified markets for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 to $2.9 billion.\nAt a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 8 and 9, 2020, the Board of Directors discussed and\nreviewed, together with its financial and legal advisors, the status of discussions with each of Apollo and Party A\nregarding a potential transaction with TEGNA and the terms of the latest proposals by each of the parties and\ncontemplated transaction structures, and that additional due diligence information continues to be provided to\nApollo. Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of the financial\nprojections provided by TEGNA\u2019s management, which were updated by management to reflect ongoing strong\nperformance of TEGNA\u2019s business. The updated forecasted financial information also included management\u2019s base\ncase projections, as well as an optimistic sensitivity case and a pessimistic sensitivity case prepared by TEGNA\nmanagement.

Representatives of the financial advisors also reviewed with\nthe Board of Directors a summary of preliminary valuation analyses, including analyses based on the different cases.\nMembers of the Board of Directors provided further guidance to senior management and TEGNA\u2019s advisors with\nrespect to the continued discussions with Apollo and Party A, and it was subsequently communicated to Party A\nthat its latest proposal was inadequate.\nBetween January and May 2021, Standard General nominated four individuals to the Board of Directors, and ran a\nproxy contest in connection with such nominations.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 21, 2021, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 7.6% of TEGNA common stock.\nOn February 10, 2021, TEGNA received a proposal from Party B to acquire TEGNA for $16.00 in cash and $4.00 in\nnewly issued preferred stock per share of TEGNA common stock, subject to due diligence.\nAt a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on February 17 and 18, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and\nreviewed, together with its financial and legal advisors, the proposal from Party B, including the proposed price,\nstructure, preferred stock component and the debt financing component, as well as the recommended response to the\nproposal.

Based on such review, the Board of Directors\ndetermined that Party B\u2019s proposal was insufficient and directed that management and advisors convey this\ndetermination to Party B and also to convey the possibility of further discussions and potentially entering into a non-\ndisclosure agreement for TEGNA to be able to provide non-public due diligence information.\nOn March 2, 2021, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 9.2% of TEGNA common stock.\nOn March 4, 2021, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting the withdrawal of\none of its nominees from the proxy contest.\nOn March 9, 2021, Standard General filed with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D, reporting beneficial\nownership on behalf of itself and certain affiliates of 7.9% of TEGNA common stock.\nFrom the end of February to mid-March 2021, TEGNA\u2019s senior management engaged in further discussions with\nrepresentatives of Party B, and on March 12, 2021, TEGNA entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Party B,\nwhich included a customary standstill restricting Party B from taking certain actions with respect to TEGNA and its\nsecurities, and also included a customary \u201cfall-away provision,\u201d as well as the ability of Party B to submit confidential\nproposals to the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors discussed the assumptions underlying these different\ncases. Representatives of the financial advisors also reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of preliminary\nvaluation analyses, including analyses based on the different cases. Members of the Board of Directors provided\nfurther guidance to senior management and TEGNA\u2019s advisors with respect to the continued discussions with\nStandard General, Apollo and Party B, including with respect to the possibility that Standard General would work\nwith Apollo in connection with a potential transaction.\nOn July 23, 2021, TEGNA entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Standard General, which included a\ncustomary standstill restricting Standard General from taking certain actions with respect to TEGNA and its\nsecurities, but that permitted Standard General to make confidential proposals to the Board of Directors.\nOn July 24, 2021, TEGNA entered into an amendment to its non-disclosure agreement with Apollo entered into in\nFebruary 2020.

Morgan, Greenhill, Wachtell Lipton and Covington, the Board of\nDirectors further discussed and reviewed the proposals from Standard General and Party B. Representatives of J.P.\nMorgan provided the Board of Directors with an update on written responses that TEGNA had requested and\nreceived from each of the parties relating to transaction structure, financing structure, regulatory efforts and other\nsignificant issues.

Representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand Greenhill then reviewed with the Board of Directors their respective summaries of their preliminary valuation\nanalyses, including summarizing how these analyses were different from the analyses summarized at prior meetings of\nthe Board of Directors, and answered questions from the directors regarding these valuation analyses.

The Board of\nDirectors also discussed and came to the consensus that it would be beneficial for TEGNA and its stockholders to\ncontinue evaluating and exploring the two proposals received from Standard General and Party B in order to\ndetermine if such proposals were actionable and would maximize value to TEGNA stockholders. The Board of\nDirectors also discussed the possibility of soliciting additional proposals to acquire TEGNA, but noted that it was\npublic knowledge that TEGNA was evaluating acquisition proposals and that there was no impediment to any party\nsubmitting a proposal. The Board of Directors also discussed the proposals from Standard General and Party B and\npossible next steps with each of these parties. Following discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Mr. Elias, Mr.\nLougee and TEGNA\u2019s management and advisors to take any actions necessary and appropriate to determine the\nviability of each proposal and to maintain a robust process in order to maximize value for TEGNA stockholders,\nincluding sending a draft merger agreement to the interested parties.\nOn October 25, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP (\u201cFried Frank\u201d), Standard General\u2019s legal advisors,\nand also to Party B\u2019s legal advisors.\nAt a virtual meeting of the Board of Directors held on October 27 and 28, 2021, the Board of Directors further\ndiscussed and reviewed, together with representatives of TEGNA\u2019s management, J.P.

Morgan to provide an update on Standard General\u2019s\nfinancing structure and to express the view that they did not believe they would have issues obtaining regulatory\napprovals and did not expect to be required to make any divestitures, but that in any case they would agree to a\n\u201chell-or-high-water\u201d regulatory efforts obligation.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 12, 2021, representatives of Party B\u2019s legal advisor sent representatives of Wachtell Lipton a further\nrevised markup of the merger agreement.\nOn November 15, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with representatives of Fried Frank certain\nmaterial issues in the markup of the draft merger agreement and provided to Fried Frank an issues list highlighting\nthose issues that TEGNA wanted specific responses to prior to further engagement, which included the amount and\ntriggers for the regulatory and financing termination fees, the regulatory efforts covenant, the duration of the outside\ndate and extensions, the financing \u201cmarketing period\u201d length and start date, the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d\nand specific exceptions, the non-solicitation covenant and related exceptions and the interim operating covenants\nand specific exceptions thereto in order for TEGNA to have flexibility to conduct its business prior to closing.\nAlso on November 15, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with representatives of Party B\u2019s legal\nadvisor certain material issues in the markup of the draft merger agreement and provided them with an issues list\nhighlighting those issues that TEGNA wanted specific responses to prior to further engagement, which included\ndeletions of the regulatory and financing reverse termination fees, the regulatory efforts covenant, the duration of the\noutside date and extensions, the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d and specific exceptions, the non-solicitation\ncovenant and related exceptions and the interim operating covenants and specific exceptions thereto in order for\nTEGNA to have flexibility to conduct its business prior to closing.\nOn November 18, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of Party\nB\u2019s financing efforts and timeline for submitting a revised proposal. Representatives of Party B indicated that they\nwere progressing their financing work and expected to submit a revised proposal on November 22, 2021.\nOn November 21, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of Party\u2019s\nB financing efforts, with representatives of Party B indicating that the financing was secured and that a revised\nproposal and response on the merger agreement terms was still expected by Party B to be delivered to TEGNA on\nNovember 22, 2021. Representatives of Party B asked about the importance of regulatory and financing reverse\ntermination fees to any deal, and representatives of J.P. Morgan stated that the Board of Directors is highly focused\non deal certainty, and reverse termination fees are an essential component of being comfortable with the level of\ncertainty for any transaction.\nOn November 23, 2021, TEGNA received a revised proposal letter from Standard General to acquire TEGNA for $22.65\nin cash per share of TEGNA common stock, with non-voting preferred equity financing from Apollo. The revised\nproposal letter included executed commitments from the debt financing sources. The revised proposal letter also\nstated that Standard General would agree to a \u201chell-or-high water\u201d regulatory covenant and agree to a regulatory\nreverse termination fee. In addition, the proposal package also included responses to TEGNA\u2019s high-level issues list\nthat was sent to representatives of Fried Frank on November 15, 2021. Thereafter, following Mr. Elias\u2019 direction,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan communicated to Mr. Kim that the proposal letter was sent to the Board of Directors\nand it would be discussed, but that the expectation is that the Board of Directors will be disappointed with the\nmodest movement in the proposed price.\nAlso, on November 23, 2021, Mr. Lougee contacted representatives of Party B to ask whether Party B intended to\nsubmit a revised proposal on price and merger agreement issues and for Party B to provide an update on the status of\nits equity and debt financing. Representatives of Party B indicated that they needed more time.\nOn November 28, 2021, representatives of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform them that Party\nB and its financing sources had made good progress and that they expected to submit a revised proposal and\nresponses to the merger agreement issues by December 1, 2021, and on November 30, 2021 representatives of Party B\nreiterated to representatives of J.P. Morgan that Party B still intended to submit a revised proposal as soon as\npossible, but noted that it was taking longer than expected due to changes in the structure of the financing.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA\u2019s management\nand financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, representatives of the financial and legal advisors provided the\nBoard of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General (with non-voting preferred\nequity financing from Apollo) and Party B, including the revised proposal from Standard General to acquire TEGNA\nfor $22.65 per share, subsequent communications between representatives\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof J.P. Morgan and Standard General regarding TEGNA\u2019s performance, valuation and the material terms of the draft\nmerger agreement. TEGNA\u2019s management discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA\u2019s financial performance,\nbusiness trends and the updated forecasted financial information that was provided to TEGNA\u2019s financial advisors\nand the bidders, noting that management believed these updated forecasts should support a higher offer.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Greenhill then reviewed and discussed with the Board of Directors their\nrespective updated preliminary valuation analyses, including based on the updated financial forecasts. The Board of\nDirectors then discussed with TEGNA\u2019s management and financial and legal advisors the various aspects of\nTEGNA\u2019s valuation, standalone prospects and strategy for communicating TEGNA\u2019s views on value to Standard\nGeneral.\nOn December 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed TEGNA\u2019s views on value with Mr. Kim, including\nexplaining various analyses that corresponded to a higher per share price than offered by Standard General. Mr. Kim\nresponded that he would be prepared to pay more than the last offer of $22.65 per share, but that the advisors for\nboth parties would need to resolve the remaining open points in the merger agreement. Representatives of J.P.\nMorgan noted that representatives of Wachtell Lipton would soon circulate a revised draft of the merger agreement.\nOn December 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the\nmerger agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to exchange drafts of the merger agreement and the ancillary\nagreements through their respective legal advisors, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank, Paul, Weiss,\nRifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), Apollo\u2019s legal advisor, Cooley LLP, regulatory counsel to Apollo,\nCovington and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, regulatory counsel to Standard General, continued to discuss\nthe open issues in these agreements.\nOn December 4 and 5, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with certain equity financing sources for Party\nB the status of the equity and debt financing for Party B\u2019s proposal to acquire TEGNA, including various issues that\nthe financing sources and Party B were negotiating and the potential timeline for Party B to submit a fully financed\nand actionable revised proposal to TEGNA.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA\u2019s management\nand financial and legal advisors. During the meeting, representatives of TEGNA\u2019s financial and legal advisors\nprovided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B and\ndiscussed various open issues with the directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed\nwith the directors the significant open issues in the merger agreement, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the\namount and triggers for the regulatory and financing reverse termination fees, the \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d definition\nand exceptions and what actions would be permitted under the interim operating covenants. Following this\ndiscussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Wachtell Lipton summarized and discussed with the Board of\nDirectors Party B\u2019s proposed terms and financing structure and associated risks.\nOn December 8, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with financial advisors of Standard General TEGNA\u2019s\nfeedback on certain material terms in the merger agreement and views on the valuation that were communicated to Mr.\nKim on December 2, 2021. The representatives of the financial advisors for Standard General stated that while their\nclient has some flexibility on price and would be willing to move higher, they wanted more specific feedback on the\nproposal.\nAlso on December 8, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with representatives of Party B the status of\nParty B\u2019s financing efforts.\nOn December 9, 2021, representatives of Standard General provided TEGNA with a letter in which Standard General\nstated that its proposal to acquire TEGNA for $22.65 per share provided a compelling value opportunity for TEGNA\nstockholders and that the terms of the draft merger agreement that Standard General was willing to accept were\nfavorable to TEGNA, including a \u201chell-or-high water\u201d regulatory covenant to address any regulatory concerns, a\ncommitment on the part of CMG Media Corporation (\u201cCMG\u201d) (an Apollo portfolio company that owns Cox Media\nGroup) to cooperate with the regulatory approval process (which was one of the requirements that representatives of\nTEGNA conveyed to representatives of Standard General) and a regulatory reverse termination fee of 4%. The letter\nfurther stated that if TEGNA did not provide a response by 12:00 p.m. on December 13, 2021 in the form of a price at\nwhich TEGNA would be prepared to transact, Standard General would be forced to conclude that TEGNA was\nunwilling to engage in a transaction and would discontinue its pursuit of TEGNA.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn December 12, 2021, following a discussion between representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Kim and Standard\nGeneral\u2019s financial advisor, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee, on behalf of TEGNA, sent a letter to Mr. Kim, informing Mr. Kim\nthat since the initial proposal to acquire TEGNA for a purchase price in the range of $22.00 to $24.00 per share,\nTEGNA had reported strong earnings for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 and that many of the same\ntrends continued. The letter further stated that the Board of Directors would be prepared to transact at a price of\n$25.00 per share, assuming the parties could resolve the remaining issues in the merger agreement.\nOn December 14, 2021, representatives of an equity financing source for Party B notified representatives of J.P.\nMorgan that they and Party B did not reach an agreement on terms between them and as a result this financing\nsource would not proceed further as a financing source for Party B. Representatives of J.P. Morgan confirmed this\ndiscussion with representatives of Party B on December 15, 2021. The representatives of Party B indicated that Party\nB intended to seek to replace its equity financing sources and needed more time to submit a fully financed proposal.\nOn December 14, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s legal advisors discussed various issues in the\nmerger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant, representations\nregarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to\nconduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into material\ncontracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed \u201cmarketing period,\u201d the definition of\n\u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect\u201d and exceptions, covenants regarding non-solicitation of alternative proposals,\nclosing conditions and termination rights and certain other issues.\nOn December 15, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim and Standard General\u2019s advisors that Mr.\nElias was prepared to meet with Mr. Kim to engage in continued negotiations on the transaction price and other\nmaterial deal terms if Standard General were prepared to materially increase its proposed purchase price towards\nTEGNA\u2019s last proposal of $25.00 per share. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also stated that prior to the meeting,\nrepresentatives of TEGNA, including Mr. Lougee, and its advisors would first need to discuss various issues in the\nmerger agreement with representatives and advisors of Standard General, including those related to operating\ncovenants and flexibility to enter into material contracts between signing and closing. The parties also discussed the\npotential timeline of the contemplated transaction, and the possibility that the timeline to a potential signing would\nlikely extend into the beginning of 2022.\nOn December 16, 2021 and December 17, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s representatives, including\nlegal advisors, continued to discuss various issues in the merger agreement and the other transaction documents,\nand representatives of Wachtell Lipton circulated revised drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction\ndocuments to representatives of Fried Frank.\nAt a telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors held on December 19, 2021, Mr. Elias and members of management\nprovided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and Party B.\nWith respect to Standard General, Mr. Elias updated the Board of Directors on the letter sent to Mr. Kim on December\n12, 2021, as well as on the open issues in the merger agreement, including the merger consideration negotiation and\nthe regulatory reverse termination fee issues. Members of the Board of Directors and TEGNA\u2019s management\ndiscussed TEGNA\u2019s strategy for resolving any open issues on the merger agreement (including the price and the\npossibility of proposing a \u201cticking fee\u201d to both bridge any valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to proceed\nmore expeditiously towards a closing), ongoing work streams, proposed timing and the status of the financing\ndocumentation, and members of the Board of Directors provided guidance to Mr. Elias and members of management\non certain of these matters and authorized them to continue negotiating with Standard General to resolve these\nissues consistent with their guidance, including with respect to price. With respect to Party B, Mr. Elias updated the\nBoard on Party B\u2019s financing efforts. Thereafter, on December 21, 2021 and December 22, 2021, representatives of J.P.\nMorgan and Mr. Kim discussed the timing for the negotiations regarding the remaining open issues in the merger\nagreement, including the merger consideration.\nAlso on December 21, 2021, TEGNA\u2019s, Standard General\u2019s and Apollo\u2019s legal advisors discussed various issues in the\nmerger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the regulatory efforts covenant,\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresentations regarding regulatory matters, the regulatory reverse termination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility\nfor TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in connection with negotiations and entering into\nmaterial contracts, financing efforts and cooperation covenants, including a proposed \u201cmarketing period\u201d and certain\nother issues.\nOn December 25, 2021, representatives of Fried Frank circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington.\nOn December 27, 2021, representatives of TEGNA (including Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee), Standard General, Apollo,\nWachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss held several discussions regarding the open issues in the merger\nagreement and the other transaction agreements, including the regulatory efforts covenant, the regulatory reverse\ntermination fee and triggers for that fee, flexibility for TEGNA to conduct its business prior to the closing, including in\nconnection with negotiations and entering into material contracts, and certain other issues. During this discussion,\nMr. Elias and Mr. Lougee stressed that valuation, deal certainty and speed were critical elements for TEGNA, and\nexplained that while TEGNA believed in its standalone prospects, TEGNA was amenable to a transaction with terms\nthat would provide more value to TEGNA stockholders than its standalone prospects.\nOn December 28, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton, Fried Frank and Paul Weiss continued to discuss certain\nopen issues in the merger agreement and the ancillary agreements, including the financing efforts and cooperation\ncovenants.\nOn January 3, 2022, TEGNA\u2019s and Standard General\u2019s advisors discussed the next steps in the potential transaction,\nwith Standard General\u2019s advisors indicating that they were discussing with their financing sources the open points in\nthe merger agreement, particularly TEGNA\u2019s position that the payment of the regulatory reverse termination fee\nshould not require a breach of the merger agreement. On January 7, 2022, Mr. Kim spoke to representatives of J.P.\nMorgan regarding the proposed transaction during which they discussed the regulatory reverse termination fee and\nthe agreement on the hell-or-high water regulatory covenant. Mr. Kim further stated to representatives of J.P. Morgan\nthat he wanted to present an updated proposal to Mr. Elias directly, in which he would also propose a possible\ncompromise position on the regulatory reverse termination fee structure.\nOn January 8, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim spoke regarding the terms of the proposed transaction. During this\ndiscussion, Mr. Kim offered a potential compromise structure in which Standard General would pay a lower regulatory\nreverse termination fee if there was no breach of the merger agreement (for example, the parties failed to obtain the\nrequired regulatory approvals by the Outside Date but fully complied with their obligations under the merger\nagreement to obtain those regulatory approvals) and that there would be a higher regulatory reverse termination fee if\nthere was a material breach of the regulatory covenant. In terms of merger consideration, Mr. Kim stated that\nStandard General was willing to increase the proposed purchase price to $23.65 per share if TEGNA were to accept\ntheir position on the reverse termination fee construct, in which a breach would be required to trigger the payment of\nany regulatory reverse termination fee. Alternatively, Standard General would pay the $22.65 per share previously\nproposed but would agree to a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure, with Standard General paying\n2% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value in a no-breach scenario and there being a termination fee of 4% of TEGNA\u2019s equity\nvalue if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Following this discussion, Mr. Elias informed the Board of\nDirectors of this proposal.\nOn January 10, 2022, Mr. Kim contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss the proposed transaction. Mr. Kim\nindicated that he had a productive discussion with Mr. Elias regarding the proposed merger consideration and the\nregulatory reverse termination fee and a possible path forward through a bifurcated fee structure, and explained his\nproposal to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Representatives of J.P. Morgan informed Mr. Kim that they expected Mr.\nElias to revert soon with TEGNA\u2019s response.\nOn January 11, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias indicated that TEGNA would not\nagree to a regulatory termination construct that required a breach for the payment of any fee. However, Mr. Elias\nstated that TEGNA would be willing to proceed with the proposed transaction if the purchase price was $24.65 per\nshare, and would be prepared to accept a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure with a fee of 2.75%\nof TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the deal price if there was no breach of the merger\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreement, with the fee increasing to 5.5% if there was a breach of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias also explained that\nTEGNA\u2019s willingness to agree to a bifurcated fee structure was a significant concession and as a result Standard\nGeneral and Apollo would need to agree to the robust regulatory efforts covenant that TEGNA\u2019s legal advisors were\nnegotiating.\nOn January 13, 2022, Mr. Kim communicated to Mr. Elias that Standard General would agree to proceed on the basis\nof a bifurcated regulatory reverse termination fee structure but only if the purchase price for TEGNA was $23.10 and\nthe regulatory reverse termination fees were 2.25% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value in a no-breach scenario and 4.5% of\nTEGNA\u2019s equity value in a breach scenario.\nOn January 14, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued their discussion of the transaction price and the structure and\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee. During this discussion, Mr. Elias rejected Mr. Kim\u2019s most recent\nproposal and discussed with Mr. Kim TEGNA\u2019s ongoing positive performance and views on valuation, and indicated\nthat if Standard General were to propose a price above $24.00 per share, TEGNA and its advisors would expeditiously\nproceed to finalize negotiations on the remaining points.\nAlso on January 14, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform J.P. Morgan\nthat Party B\u2019s stand-alone performance was improving and it was continuing to look for different structures and\nfinancing alternatives to potentially acquire TEGNA.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting, which was attended by TEGNA\u2019s management and\nfinancial and legal advisors. During the meeting, Mr. Elias and Mr. Lougee provided the Board of Directors with an\nupdate on the status of negotiations with Standard General, including the negotiations regarding the merger\nconsideration, the regulatory reverse termination fee (including the proposal by Standard General to bifurcate the\namount of this fee if there was a material breach of the regulatory efforts covenant) and the possibility of introducing\na \u201cticking fee\u201d concept to bridge the valuation gap and incentivize Standard General to more expeditiously attempt to\nobtain regulatory approvals for the transaction. Following discussions regarding these topics, Mr. Elias described to\nthe Board of Directors the recent outreach by Party B to representatives of J.P. Morgan. Also, during this meeting,\nMr. Lougee discussed with the Board of Directors TEGNA\u2019s recent and expected financial performance and\ndiscussions with distributors and provided a brief business and investor relations update.\nOn January 18, 2022, representatives of Party B and its financial advisor contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to\ninform them that Party B was actively pursuing an updated financing package in order to submit a revised proposal to\nacquire TEGNA and provided details on Party B\u2019s potential updated financing structure.\nBetween January 18, 2022 and January 21, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to negotiate the open issues in the\nmerger agreement and the ancillary agreements. During this period, Mr. Kim proposed to Mr. Elias merger\nconsideration of $23.70 in cash. Following discussion with TEGNA\u2019s management and financial advisors, Mr. Elias\ninformed Mr. Kim that TEGNA would be prepared to agree to a transaction at $24.50 per share. Mr. Elias also indicated\nthat Standard General could agree to a \u201cticking fee\u201d if the transaction was not consummated within nine months\nfollowing signing as a way to bridge the valuation gap and provide additional comfort to TEGNA on Standard\nGeneral\u2019s efforts to consummate the closing on a more expedited timeline. In addition, Mr. Elias proposed that the\namount of the regulatory reverse termination fee be 2.5% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the transaction price if there is\nno breach of the merger agreement or 5% if there is a breach. Mr. Elias also proposed that the financing failure reverse\ntermination fee be 5% of TEGNA\u2019s equity value at the transaction price. The following day, Mr. Kim provided to Mr.\nElias a further counteroffer of either $24.00 per share and no ticking fee, or $23.90 per share and a ticking fee of $0.10\ncents per month starting nine months after the signing of the merger agreement. Mr. Elias indicated that he believed\nthat $24.00 would be acceptable but only (i) with the ticking fee of $0.05 per month starting after nine months, and\nescalating to $0.15 per month after 12 months and (ii) if Standard General would accept TEGNA\u2019s remaining positions\non the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open issues. Mr. Kim stated that he would agree to this\nconstruct but would need to seek approval from his financing sources.\nOn January 21, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias provided the Board of\nDirectors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General and its financing sources, including\nthat there was an agreement (subject to the approval of the Board of Directors) on the price of $24.00 per share and\nthe amount of the financing and regulatory reverse termination fees, and described the\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nremaining open issues in the merger agreement such as the regulatory efforts covenant and TEGNA\u2019s \u201cticking fee\u201d\nproposal, which was being considered by Standard General and its financing sources. Members of the Board of\nDirectors indicated support for the terms that were negotiated. Mr. Elias also provided an update on interactions with\nParty B.\nOn January 24, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim continued to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction, with Mr. Kim\nconfirming the agreement on $24.00 per share and a \u201cticking fee\u201d of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and\n12 months following execution of definitive transaction documents, and also indicating that Standard General would\naccept most of TEGNA\u2019s requests on the regulatory efforts covenant and certain other open points. However, Mr.\nKim noted that the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d after 12 months following signing remained an open item, but that he\nwas confident it would be resolved in due course. Based on this discussion, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim further agreed that\nthe parties and their advisors would expeditiously continue discussing and finalizing the transaction agreements.\nOn January 24, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Fried Frank a revised draft of the\nmerger agreement reflecting Mr. Elias\u2019 and Mr. Kim\u2019s agreement, and thereafter the parties continued to discuss and\nexchange drafts of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents through February 21, 2022, including\nnegotiating the terms of the non-solicitation covenant, the regulatory efforts covenant, the restrictions on TEGNA\u2019s\noperations between signing and closing, the triggers for the regulatory reverse termination fees, TEGNA\u2019s efforts to\nassist Standard General in its financing efforts and certain other issues.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting during which Mr. Elias and representatives of\nWachtell Lipton provided the Board of Directors with an update on the status of negotiations with Standard General\nand its financing sources, noting that a summary of the current draft merger agreement and the other transaction\nagreements had been provided to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting. As part of this update, Mr. Elias again\ndescribed to the Board of Directors the terms that had been agreed with Standard General if the transaction was\nultimately approved by the Board of Directors, including (i) that the amount of the merger consideration would be\n$24.00 per share, (ii) the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d of $0.05 per month for the period between nine and 12 months\nfollowing execution of definitive transaction documents (with Mr. Elias noting that the amount of the \u201cticking fee\u201d for\nmonths 12 through 15 remained subject to further negotiation), and (iii) the amount of the financing and regulatory\nreverse termination fees. Mr. Elias summarized for the Board of Directors the various work streams that were in\nprocess with respect to the proposed transaction, including an update on Standard General\u2019s efforts to obtain\nadditional preferred equity financing sources. Mr. Elias also discussed with the Board of Directors the potential\ntimeline to reaching the end of negotiations. Mr. Elias reported that TEGNA had not received any updates from Party\nB. Mr. Lougee then described to the Board of Directors his discussions with Deborah A. McDermott, the CEO of\nStandard Media, in which Mr. Lougee provided an in-depth overview of TEGNA and discussed the communications\nplan for TEGNA and Standard Media if a transaction were to be announced.\nOn February 2, 2022, a representative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to provide an update on its\nefforts to obtain equity and debt financing for a possible acquisition of TEGNA, including that it was replacing\ncertain of its potential equity financing sources with others. The representative of Party B also indicated that Party B\nnow intended to submit a revised proposal within one to two weeks. Thereafter, on February 21, 2022, a\nrepresentative of Party B contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that Party B was progressing on its\nefforts to obtain preferred financing and intended to soon submit to TEGNA a term sheet for the preferred equity\nfinancing.\nBetween January 31, 2022 and February 9, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of the parties and\ntheir respective advisors continued to discuss the open points in the merger agreement, the timing of the proposed\ntransaction, the status of the financing efforts being undertaken by Standard General, including additional preferred\nequity financing sources that Apollo was seeking to have join the proposed transaction. During this period, the\nparties also exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and other transaction documents.\nOn February 10, 2022, Mr. Elias and Mr. Kim and other representatives of TEGNA and Standard General discussed\ncertain open issues in the merger agreement, including the amount of the \u201cticking fee,\u201d the triggers for the higher\nregulatory reverse termination fee, the regulatory efforts covenants and TEGNA\u2019s flexibility to negotiate material\nagreements in the interim period prior to closing, with the parties agreeing as part of these discussions on the amount\nof the \u201cticking fee\u201d to be set forth in the merger agreement.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBetween February 11 and 21, 2022, representatives of the parties continued to negotiate the remaining open points in\nthe merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including the efforts required to obtain regulatory\napprovals, the triggers for the payment of the higher regulatory reverse termination fee, TEGNA\u2019s flexibility to\nnegotiate material agreements in the interim period prior to closing and the terms of the preferred equity commitment\nletter and limited guarantee. During this period, the parties also exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and other\ntransaction documents.\nOn February 21, 2022, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve\nTEGNA\u2019s entry into definitive transaction documents providing for, among other things, the merger of TEGNA.\nRepresentatives of senior management and advisors provided an overview of the proposed transaction\u2019s final\neconomic terms, including the merger consideration of $24.00 per share, with a \u201cticking fee\u201d of $0.00167 per share per\nday (or $0.05 per month) if the Closing occurs between nine and 12 months following signing, increasing to $0.0025\nper share per day (or $0.075 per month) if the Closing occurs between 12 and 13 months following signing, $0.00333\nper share per day (or $0.10 per month) if the Closing occurs between 13 and 14 months following signing, and\n$0.00417 per share per day (or $0.125 per month) if the closing occurs between 14 and 15 months following signing.\nRepresentatives of the financial advisors reviewed with the Board of Directors their final valuation analyses and\nanswered questions from the Board of Directors. Representatives of the financial advisors then rendered to the Board\nof Directors their respective oral fairness opinions, which were subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date,\nto the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other\nmatters considered in the preparation thereof as set forth in each such opinion, the $24.00 in cash, without interest, to\nbe received by TEGNA stockholders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors its\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with considering the approval of a potential sale of TEGNA.\nRepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the draft of the merger agreement and other\ntransaction documents, representatives of Covington discussed with the Board of Directors the regulatory approval\nprocess for the proposed transaction, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Covington answered questions\nfrom the Board of Directors regarding the transaction documents and the proposed transaction. The Board of\nDirectors thereafter discussed with TEGNA\u2019s management and the financial and legal advisors their perspectives on\nthe proposed transaction, including that Party B had not submitted any updated proposal. After further discussion\nand deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the other transaction\ndocuments, the merger and the other transactions, and resolved to recommend that TEGNA stockholders adopt the\nmerger agreement.\nAlso on February 21, 2022, the board of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and CMG held a virtual meeting to discuss\nand consider whether to approve the applicable Parent Restructuring Entities\u2019 entry into definitive transaction\ndocuments providing for, among other things, the merger of TEGNA. Early in the morning of February 22, 2022,\nParent\u2019s, Merger Sub\u2019s and CMG\u2019s board of directors unanimously approved by written consent the merger\nagreement and the other transaction documents, the merger and the other transactions.\nFollowing approval by the respective boards of directors, early in the morning of February 22, 2022, the parties\nexecuted the final transaction documents and issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.\nOn March 10, 2022, TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, and, solely for purposes of certain provisions specified therein, the\nother Parent Restructuring Entities, entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d). The\nAmendment provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that certain\nregulatory efforts covenants will apply with respect to certain station transfers from Parent or an affiliate of Parent to\nCMG or an affiliate of CMG that are contemplated to be consummated as of immediately following the Effective Time.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

Morgan and Greenhill. The Board of Directors considered a number of\nfactors, including those below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as\ngenerally supporting its (i) approval of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by TEGNA, the\nperformance by TEGNA of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation\nof the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e and (ii) resolution to\nrecommend that the TEGNA stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of TEGNA common stock, including the market performance of\nTEGNA common stock relative to those of other participants in TEGNA\u2019s industry and general market\nindices, and the fact that the Base Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium of 39.0% over\nTEGNA\u2019s closing stock price of $17.26 on September 14, 2021 (the last trading day before market rumors\nabout the potential acquisition of TEGNA appeared in the media), a premium of 38.0% over TEGNA\u2019s 20-\ntrading-day volume-weighted average share price through that date, and a premium of 11.0% over TEGNA\u2019s\nall-time high closing price since separation from the Gannett publishing business in 2015\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks associated with continuing to operate TEGNA as a standalone broadcasting company, including risks\nrelated to TEGNA\u2019s long-term strategic plan, industry trends and changes in laws and regulations affecting\nthe broadcasting industry, including FCC regulatory, legislative or implementation initiatives that could\naffect TEGNA\u2019s operations and business condition\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors\u2019 belief that TEGNA had engaged in an extensive and lengthy review of strategic\nalternatives over the past two years, with the assistance of J.P. Morgan, Greenhill and other strategic\nadvisors, which explored solicited and unsolicited interest in potential transactions, both within and\nadjacent to broadcasting, including with those parties that were believed to be the most able and willing to\ntransact, as more fully described above in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Background of\nthe Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the pool of potential acquirers of TEGNA could continue to decrease due to industry\nconsolidation trends and the potential for continuing regulatory constraints on ownership of television\nstations and other media interests\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief of the Board of Directors, based upon the course of negotiations with Standard General (as more\nfully described above in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d), that\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration represents the highest price that Parent was willing to pay and that the\nterms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to the Company, in the aggregate, to\nwhich Parent was willing to agree\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Board of Director\u2019s view as to the timing and likelihood of the consummation of the Merger, in light of\nthe required regulatory approvals, the commitments made by the Parent Restructuring Entities to obtain\nsuch approvals (including the fact that the Parent Restructuring Entities are required to use\n42TABLE OF CONTENTS\nreasonable best efforts to take action in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals of the Merger, as\nmore fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other\nCovenants-Efforts to Consummate the Merger\u201d) and the conditions to Closing contained in the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe view of the Board of Directors that the Per Share Merger Consideration was more favorable to TEGNA\nstockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives\nreasonably available to TEGNA, based upon the Board of Directors\u2019 extensive knowledge of TEGNA\u2019s\nbusiness, assets, financial condition and results of operations, its competitive position and historical and\nprojected financial performance, and the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented an\nattractive and comparatively certain value for TEGNA stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects\nfor TEGNA on a standalone basis\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial analysis presentations of each of J.P.

        "Section Text": "Other Information\nPresent Value of Future Share Price. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\ncalculated a range of the present values of future share prices using the multiple reference range of 7.0x to 8.0x based\non the ratio of enterprise value to average 2022-23E Weighted Sensitivity Case EBITDA and a 12.3% cost of equity.\nBased on the foregoing, Greenhill noted that the range of such present values of future shares price was $22.09 to\n$26.54 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nPrecedent Premiums Paid. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill calculated a\nrange of implied share prices by applying a range of precedent premiums paid from 25% to 35% to the unaffected\nclosing price of TEGNA common stock of $17.26 as of September 14, 2021. Based on the foregoing, Greenhill noted\nthat the range of implied prices per share was $21.58 to $23.30 per share of TEGNA common stock.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed certain equity research analyst price targets for TEGNA common stock between TEGNA\u2019s Q2\u201921 earnings\nrelease on August 9, 2021 and September 14, 2021. Greenhill noted that the range of such price targets was $20.00 to\n$24.00 per share of TEGNA common stock.\n52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, Greenhill\nreviewed the trading range for TEGNA common stock for the trailing 52-week period as of September 14, 2021.\nGreenhill noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $11.26 and $21.52 per share of\nTEGNA common stock, respectively.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of the analyses or data presented by Greenhill. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process\nand is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Greenhill believes\n56TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the\nforegoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete\nview of the processes underlying the analyses and its fairness opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting\nfrom any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were utilized to create points of reference for\nanalytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of Greenhill with respect to the actual value of TEGNA.\nThe order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGreenhill. In arriving at its opinion, Greenhill did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors\nconsidered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),\nconsidered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, Greenhill considered the totality of the\nfactors and analyses performed in determining its opinion. Accordingly, Greenhill believes that the summary set forth\nabove and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions thereof, without considering all of\nits analyses, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or\nevents beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by\nGreenhill are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by those analyses. Moreover, Greenhill\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or\notherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected\ncompanies reviewed as described in the summary of the peer trading multiples analysis or the precedent transaction\nmultiples analysis is identical to TEGNA, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.\nHowever, the companies for the peer trading multiples analysis were selected because they are publicly traded\ncompanies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthose of TEGNA. The transactions selected for the precedent transaction multiples analysis were similarly chosen\nbecause their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of Greenhill\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to\nthe Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies\ncompared to TEGNA and the transactions compared to the Merger.\nGreenhill is an internationally recognized investment banking firm regularly engaged in providing financial advisory\nservices in connection with mergers and acquisitions. TEGNA selected Greenhill as its financial advisor in connection\nwith the Merger on the basis of Greenhill\u2019s experience in similar transactions, its reputation in the investment banking\ncommunity and its familiarity with the media sector.\nFor services rendered in connection with the Merger and the delivery of the opinion, TEGNA has agreed to pay\nGreenhill a fee of $12,000,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable upon delivery of Greenhill\u2019s fairness opinion and\nthe remainder of which is contingent and payable only upon the completion of the Merger. In addition, TEGNA has\nagreed to reimburse Greenhill for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and\ndisbursements of counsel, and will indemnify Greenhill against certain liabilities arising out of Greenhill\u2019s\nengagement. During the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has not been engaged by,\nperformed any services for or received any compensation from TEGNA, Parent, Merger Sub, Standard General,\nApollo, the other Parent Restructuring Entities or their respective affiliates, other than the compensation that was\npaid to Greenhill under the letter agreements pursuant to which Greenhill was retained as a financial advisor to\nTEGNA in connection with the Merger. In the two years preceding the date of Greenhill\u2019s opinion, Greenhill has been\nengaged by certain affiliates of Apollo and Ares Management to provide financial advisory services\u037e however, no\ntransactions have ensued, and Greenhill has not received any compensation for its engagements from either Apollo\nor Ares Management or their affiliates.",

Harrison, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.\nThe Merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the TEGNA executive compensation and benefit plans and\nagreements described below.\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on March 18, 2022 (the \u201cAssumed Closing Date\u201d),\nwhich is the assumed date of the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Per Share Merger Consideration is $24.00\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of TEGNA was terminated by Parent or the Surviving\nCorporation without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms\nare defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on\nthe Assumed Closing Date.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before completion of the Merger.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding TEGNA\nequity awards (including those held by the executive officers) will be treated as follows, subject to all required\nwithholding taxes:\n\u2022\nEach Company Restricted Stock Award will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to\nthe product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to such Company Restricted\nStock Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.\n\u2022\nEach Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and be converted into\nthe right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common\nstock subject to such Company RSU Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.\n\u2022\nEach Company PSU Award, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and be converted into\nthe right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common\nstock subject to such Company PSU Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The\nnumber of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to a Company PSU Award not granted in 2021 will be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement, which generally provide\nthat the number of shares is determined based on target performance, unless the two-year performance\nperiod is complete as of the change in control, in which case the number of shares is determined based on\nactual performance. The number of shares of TEGNA common stock subject to each Company PSU Award\ngranted in 2021 will equal the greater of\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(x) such number as determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable award agreement (as\ndescribed in the immediately preceding sentence) and (y) the number of shares that would be paid under\nsuch award assuming the Company\u2019s actual performance versus target performance for 2021 was also\nachieved for 2022.\n\u2022\nEach Company Phantom Share Unit Award will be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal\nto the product of (a) the number of shares of TEGNA common stock in respect of such Company Phantom\nShare Unit Award multiplied by (b) the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of each named executive officer\u2019s\nunvested TEGNA equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Certain Assumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate value of the unvested TEGNA equity awards held by\nTEGNA\u2019s nonemployee directors is $441,551.\nTreatment of Annual Bonus\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA will provide to each TEGNA employee (including each of the\nnamed executive officers) who is eligible to participate in a TEGNA annual bonus program, a prorated portion of the\nannual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus will\nbe determined based on the greater of (a) the employee\u2019s target annual bonus for such year and (b) the employee\u2019s\nannual bonus amount for such year determined based on actual performance results through the Closing.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated amount of the prorated bonus payment\nthat each of TEGNA\u2019s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nExecutive Change in Control Severance Arrangements\nTEGNA maintains the TEGNA 2015 Change in Control Severance Plan (the \u201cCIC Severance Plan\u201d), which provides\nseverance benefits for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. Mr. Lougee is the only executive officer\nwho participates in the CIC Severance Plan. Under the CIC Severance Plan, a participant would be eligible for\nseverance benefits if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated by TEGNA without \u201ccause,\u201d or due to the\nparticipant\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of\nTEGNA, or prior to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control, subject to\nthe participant\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release agreement.\nThe severance benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times the sum\nof (i) the participant\u2019s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period immediately before the change in\ncontrol or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater, and (ii) the average annual bonus the\nparticipant earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the change in\ncontrol occurs or immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs, whichever is greater\u037e (b)\na prorated annual bonus calculated based on the average annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the\nthree fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs\u037e and (c) the monthly\nCOBRA cost of the participant\u2019s medical and dental coverage in effect as of the date of termination multiplied by the\nlesser of (i) 18 and (ii) 24 minus the number of full months between the date of the change in control and the date of\ntermination.\nTEGNA also maintains the TEGNA Transitional Compensation Plan (the \u201cTCP\u201d), a legacy change-in-control plan that\nprovides severance protections for its participants upon a change in control of TEGNA. All of TEGNA\u2019s executive\nofficers other than Mr. Lougee participate in the TCP. Under the TCP, a participant would be eligible for severance\nbenefits if the participant\u2019s employment is terminated by TEGNA without \u201ccause,\u201d or due to the participant\u2019s\nresignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case, on or within two years following a change in control of TEGNA, or prior\nto a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control. In addition the TCP\nentitles Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison to severance benefits upon a resignation without good reason during a 30-day\nwindow period beginning on the first anniversary of the change in control.\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe severance benefits under the TCP are (a) a cash severance payment equal to three times (or in the case of Ms.\nHarker, two times) the sum of (i) the participant\u2019s highest rate of annual salary during the 12-month period (plus\ncertain other compensation included in the participant\u2019s income for income tax purposes during such 12-month\nperiod) immediately before the change in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater,\nand (ii) the highest annual bonus earned with respect to the three fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in\nwhich the change in control occurs or the highest annual bonus earned with respect to any fiscal year during the\nperiod between the change in control and the date of termination, whichever is greater\u037e (b) a prorated annual bonus\ncalculated based on the highest annual bonus the participant earned with respect to the three fiscal years\nimmediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs\u037e (c) continuation of life insurance coverage\nand medical benefits for three years (or in the case of Ms. Harker, two years)\u037e and (d) for each of Ms. Beall and Mr.\nHarrison, a lump-sum payment in an amount determined based upon the retirement plan benefits and supplemental\nexecutive retirement plan benefits the participant would have received if participant had remained employed by the\nCompany during the applicable severance period.\nIf the compensation and benefits payable to an executive officer would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999\nof the Internal Revenue Code, (a) in the case of Mr. Lougee and Ms. Harker, such amounts shall either be paid in full\nor reduced to the level that would avoid application of the excise tax, whichever would place the executive officer in a\nbetter after-tax position\u037e and (b) each of Ms. Beall and Mr. Harrison would receive a make-whole payment, which\nwould generally place such executive officer in the same after-tax position that he or she would have been in if the\nexcise tax did not apply.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated amounts that each of TEGNA\u2019s named\nexecutive officers would receive under the applicable change-in-control arrangement upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment following a change in control of TEGNA.\nRetirement Plans\nTEGNA maintains the TEGNA Supplemental Retirement Plan (\u201cSERP\u201d), which is a nonqualified defined benefit\npension plan maintained for the benefit of designated U.S.-based management or highly compensated employees\nwhose benefits under TEGNA\u2019s tax-qualified defined benefit plan, the TEGNA Retirement Plan (\u201cTRP\u201d), are limited by\nIRS limitations on amounts that may be paid from a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All of TEGNA\u2019s\nexecutive officers participate in both the TRP and the SERP, other than Ms. Harker, who does not participate in any\ndefined benefit plan. Each executive officer who participates in the TRP is already fully vested in his or her TRP\nbenefits.\nGenerally, a participant must complete five years of service and attain the age of 55 to become 100% vested in his or\nher benefits under the SERP. Each of the executive officers who participate in the SERP is already fully vested in his or\nher SERP benefits, other than Mr. Harrison. In accordance with the rules under the SERP, Mr. Harrison\u2019s SERP benefits\nwill become fully vested upon a change in control.\nSee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to TEGNA\u2019s\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of the accelerated benefits that Mr.\nHarrison would receive under the SERP upon a change in control of TEGNA.\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Parent\nAny of TEGNA\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide\nservices to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, prior to, on or following the Closing, enter into new\ncompensation arrangements with Parent or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no new\nindividualized compensation arrangements between TEGNA\u2019s executive officers and Parent or the Surviving\nCorporation have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, TEGNA\u2019s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain\nongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under directors\u2019 and\nofficers\u2019 liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL\nand is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and\nincorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not\nconstitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in\nSection 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of TEGNA common stock\nunless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to\ndemand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name.

If you hold your shares of TEGNA common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee\nand you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, TEGNA stockholders who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of\ntheir shares\u037e (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously are the record\nholders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures\n69TABLE OF CONTENTS\nset forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to\nreceive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted appraisal\nrights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1%\nof the outstanding shares of TEGNA common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or\n(b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of TEGNA common stock for\nwhich appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the\n\u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the\ndate the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the\nappraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of\nsuch payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of\nsuch voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make\nsuch voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the\nrecord date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal\nrights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes TEGNA\u2019s notice\nto stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the Merger, any TEGNA stockholder who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully.\nFailure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nPer Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the\nprocedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of TEGNA common stock, TEGNA believes that if a\nstockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of TEGNA common stock must do ALL\nof the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to TEGNA a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the\nMerger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\nEffective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the\nEffective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either\nin a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition\nin the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120\ndays after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has\nno intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFiling Written Demand\nAny TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to TEGNA, before the vote on the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will\nbe submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder\nmust not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A TEGNA stockholder exercising\nappraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must\ncontinue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will\nconstitute a waiver of the TEGNA stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written\ndemand for appraisal. Therefore, a TEGNA stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain\nfrom voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.\nThe written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A\nTEGNA stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the Special Meeting of TEGNA stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of TEGNA common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of TEGNA common stock must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform TEGNA of the identity of the holder and\nstate that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If the\nshares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than\none person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint\nowners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for\nappraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly\ndisclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nTEGNA STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR\nBANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES\nFOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES.\nA PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD\nHOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nTEGNA Inc.\nAttention: General Counsel\n8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000\nTysons, Virginia 22102\nAny TEGNA stockholder who has delivered a written demand to TEGNA and who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration by delivering to TEGNA a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nHowever, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require\nwritten approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be\ndismissed as to any TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval\nmay be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this\nshall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share\nMerger Consideration within 60 days after the\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEffective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and TEGNA, as the Surviving Corporation, does not\napprove a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any\nTEGNA stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately\npreceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding\nwith respect to a TEGNA stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined\nin any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger\nConsideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each TEGNA\nstockholder who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in\nfavor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any TEGNA stockholder\nwho has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any\nbeneficial owner of the relevant shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a TEGNA\nstockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting\nTEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present\nintention, to file a petition, and TEGNA stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a\npetition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of TEGNA common stock.\nAccordingly, any TEGNA stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action\nto perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of TEGNA common stock within the time and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. The failure of a TEGNA stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in\nSection 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any TEGNA stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section\n262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which TEGNA has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting TEGNA\nstockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or\nwithin 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial\nowner of shares of TEGNA common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may,\nin such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a TEGNA stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the\nDelaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all TEGNA stockholders\nwho have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not\nbeen reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the TEGNA\nstockholders shown on the written statement described above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also\nbe published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the\nCity of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne\nby the Surviving Corporation. After notice to TEGNA stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of\nChancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those TEGNA stockholders who have\ncomplied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require TEGNA stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates\n(if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any\nTEGNA stockholder fails to comply with the\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndirection, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all TEGNA stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if\nneither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of \u201cFair Value\u201d\nAfter determining the TEGNA stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will\nbe conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of TEGNA common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of\npayment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date\nof payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the\nappraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each TEGNA stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at\nsuch time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather\napplies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nTEGNA stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as\nto the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same\nas, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither TEGNA nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share\nMerger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of TEGNA and Parent reserves the\nrights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of TEGNA common stock is less than the Per\nShare Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will\ncease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a TEGNA stockholder, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with\nan\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts,\nbe charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination\nor assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any TEGNA stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of TEGNA common stock under Section\n262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of\nTEGNA common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per\nShare Merger Consideration. A TEGNA stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder\u2019s\nright to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the\nownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the\nstockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no TEGNA stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote\nsuch shares of TEGNA common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on\nthe stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of TEGNA common stock, if any, payable to\nTEGNA stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the\nownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to the TEGNA stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or\nif the TEGNA stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval\nof the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to\nany TEGNA stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms\nas the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any TEGNA stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the\nEffective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any TEGNA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged\nto consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that\nmay be relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of shares of TEGNA common stock whose shares of TEGNA\ncommon stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S.\nHolders who hold their shares of TEGNA common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of\nthe Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and\nall of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.

In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned income\nMedicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or any\nconsiderations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010\n(including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in\nconnection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and\ncertain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of TEGNA\ncommon stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY\nPARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX\nCIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC\nTAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND\nOTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of TEGNA common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the\nlaws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless\nof its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration\nof such trust and one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority\nto control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United\nStates person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of TEGNA common stock pursuant to the Merger will be\na taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss\nin an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares of TEGNA common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\ngenerally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of TEGNA common stock. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of TEGNA common stock\ngenerally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger.\nLong-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at preferential rates currently, which rates are subject to change. The deductibility of capital losses is\nsubject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of TEGNA common stock at different times or\ndifferent prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to\neach block of TEGNA common stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in\nconnection with the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder\npursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed\nand executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that\nsuch U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup\nwithholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information\nis timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL\nCHANGES OR INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE\nACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH,\nOR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-\nINCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS\nARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",

A transaction notifiable\nunder the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings\nof their HSR Act notification and report forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the Federal Trade\nCommission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for\nadditional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as the \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration\nof the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only\nafter the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier\nor the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.\nThe parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on March 8, 2022. On April 11, 2022, the parties re-\nfiled their HSR filings to give the DOJ additional time to review the Merger.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution\nAgreement, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR Act,\n77TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the\nContribution Agreement, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or\nhold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the\ncompletion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, any state could take\nsuch action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could\ninclude seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution\nAgreement or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal\naction under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger and\nthe transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will\nprevail.\nFederal Communications Commission Consent\nTEGNA holds various licenses necessary for the operation of its broadcast television stations. These licenses are\ngranted by the FCC. The Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules require that, in connection with a change of\ncontrol of TEGNA, TEGNA and the transferee must make certain filings with the FCC. Under the Merger Agreement,\nit is a condition to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger that the FCC grant the FCC Consent, which\nincludes the grant of applications to transfer control of TEGNA\u2019s licenses and a petition for declaratory ruling under\nSection 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules governing foreign ownership. For more information,\nsee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to Consummate\nthe Merger.\u201d\nThe FCC Applications involve a change of more than 50% of the voting rights representing ultimate control of\nTEGNA and its broadcast subsidiaries and thus will constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d change in ownership or control of the\nTEGNA licensees within the meaning of the FCC\u2019s rules. Accordingly, the FCC must provide public notice for a\nperiod of 30 days prior to acting on the FCC Applications. During that period, interested parties, including members\nof the public, may file informal objections to, or petitions to deny, the FCC Applications. The filing of a petition to\ndeny or an informal objection could delay FCC processing of the FCC Applications.\nIn determining whether to approve the transfer of control of a television broadcast licensee or an assignment of\nlicense, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the proposed licensee, including compliance with\nvarious rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the licensee and those persons\nholding significant voting or positional interests in the licensee or in the entities controlling the licensee, the\nCommunications Act limitations on foreign ownership and control of broadcast licensees, and compliance with FCC\nrules and regulations. The timing or outcome of the FCC approval process cannot be predicted.\nThe parties have submitted the FCC Applications required to obtain the FCC Consent.",

Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company\nreasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d) for the payment of the\nMerger Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company\nrelating to the Paying Agent\u2019s responsibilities under this Agreement.\n(b) Deposit of Merger Consideration. Prior to or as of the Teton Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or\ncause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company\nCommon Stock that are converted in accordance with this Agreement, a cash amount that, when taken together\nwith any Available Cash which the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the Teton Merger Effective\nTime (to the extent requested by Parent), is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable\npursuant to this Article III (such cash, the \u201cPayment Fund\u201d). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any\npurpose other than to fund payments of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III.\n(c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the fifth Business Day) after the Teton\nMerger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (i) to each holder of record of one or more\nCertificates whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii), (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that\ndelivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of\nthe Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions)\nand (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration and (ii) to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock\nwere converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii),\ninstructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger\nConsideration.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common\nStock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, payment of the Merger\nConsideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry\nShare so surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed or\notherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other\nTaxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes\nhave been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(c), each Certificate\nor Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Teton Merger Effective Time to represent only the\nright to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any\npayment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.\n(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. From and after the Teton Merger Effective\nTime, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry\nShares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been\nconverted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance\nwith Section 3.2(c), without interest and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with\nrespect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger Effective\nTime, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving\nCompany of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Teton Merger\nEffective Time.

The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as\ndirected by Parent\u037e provided, that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United\nStates government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. or\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or\nbanker\u2019s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial\nstatements of such bank that are then publicly available)\u037e provided, further, that no such investment or loss\nthereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article\nIII, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the\nPaying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Teton Merger Effective\nTime in the amount of such losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any\nnet profits resulting from or income arising out of such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company.\n(f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other amounts\nreceived with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of\nCertificates and Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Teton Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to\nParent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that has not theretofore complied\nwith this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned\nproperty, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger\nConsideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, without any interest thereon.\n(g) No Liability.

Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Teton Merger Sub and the\nPaying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable\npursuant to this Agreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of\nsuch payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely\nremitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all\npurposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or\nwithholding was made.\n(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit\nof that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or\nthe Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may\ndetermine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving\nCompany with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment\nFund and subject to Section 3.2(f), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed\nCertificate, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nSection 3.3",
