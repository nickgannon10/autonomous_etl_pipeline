Instead, Intersect ENT will remain\nan independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, Intersect ENT will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $29.25 million\nupon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fee.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation\nProposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Intersect ENT to seek an advisory (non-binding)\nvote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection\nwith the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present online or represented\nby proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the\nCompensation Proposal.\n10\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with\nrespect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Intersect ENT. Therefore, if\nthe other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under\nthe Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Intersect ENT\u2019s named executive officers in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ:\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nA:\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d for\ncustomers have the authority to vote on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions\nfrom beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their\nvoting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal and the\nproposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies to\napprove the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement at the time of the Special Meeting, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial\nowner of such shares of Intersect ENT common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not\nempowered to vote those shares of Intersect ENT common stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to\ngenerally as \u201cbroker non-votes.\u201d Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are\nroutine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Intersect ENT does not expect any\nbroker non-votes at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this\nproxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects\nyou. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided\nin the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the\nvoting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nShould I surrender my book-entry shares now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, the payment agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and\nwritten instructions that explain how to exchange shares of common stock represented by such holder\u2019s book-\nentry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the\nSpecial Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger\nis expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before\nthe Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Intersect ENT in writing of\nsuch special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger consideration, if the\nMerger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to\nvote those shares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights in connection\nwith the Merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of\ncommon stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the\naccompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\n1\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.,\nyou are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy\nstatement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Intersect ENT.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of\nshares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by\nyour bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of\nrecord. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote\nyour shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.\nHowever, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares online at the Special\nMeeting.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to\nbe considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You\nshould follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted\nagainst adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting and voting online.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your\nshares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting\nelectronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nPlease be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the\nInternet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will\nbe responsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting online, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of\ncommon stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to vote shares that you\nbeneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock online at the Special Meeting even if you\nhave previously voted by proxy.

You may also vote online at the Special Meeting if\nyou obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document\ndescribing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The\ndocument used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Intersect ENT Board frequently reviews, with Intersect ENT senior management, and with the assistance of its\noutside advisors, Intersect ENT\u2019s strategic and financial alternatives in light of developments in Intersect ENT\u2019s\nbusiness, the sectors in which it competes, the economy generally and financial markets. Over the past eighteen (18)\nmonths, this assessment has also been informed by perceptions of the current and prospective impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. As part of this process, members of Intersect ENT senior management have engaged in business\ndevelopment and strategic discussions with participants in the medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare\nequipment industries, all with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders and delivering the best possible\ntreatments and services to patients and healthcare providers. Intersect ENT\u2019s strategic discussions have also\nfocused on, among other things, collaborations with other medical device companies.\nOn June 22, 2020, Mr. Thomas A. West, Chief Executive Officer of Intersect ENT, received a telephone call from Mr.\nChris Cleary, Vice President of Corporate Development at Medtronic, noting that Medtronic planned to send a letter\nproposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for a purchase price of $17.50 per share in cash.\nLater that day, Medtronic provided the proposal letter via email. Mr. West acknowledged receipt of the acquisition\nproposal letter via email. Mr. West promptly notified the Intersect ENT Board of the acquisition proposal letter. On\nJune 22, 2020, shares of Intersect ENT common stock closed on Nasdaq at $12.60 per share.\nOn June 25, 2020 the Intersect ENT Board convened via teleconference. At that time, the Intersect ENT Board agreed\nto establish the Intersect ENT Transaction Advisory Committee to guide the interactions between Intersect ENT, its\nadvisors and Medtronic and to preview any recommendations or proposals prior to full\n22TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntersect ENT Board review. The Transaction Advisory Committee was comprised of the following Intersect ENT\nBoard members: Kieran Gallahue, Dana Mead and Cindy Lucchese, each of whom are independent directors and were\nchosen based on their experience with strategic transactions, existing roles on our Intersect ENT Board and\nwillingness to serve on the Transaction Advisory Committee. In addition, the Intersect ENT Board agreed to engage\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC as financial advisor to Intersect ENT (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) and Cooley LLP as Intersect\nENT\u2019s outside legal counsel (\u201cCooley\u201d) for the purpose of assisting the Intersect ENT Board in evaluating the\nacquisition proposal letter. Over the course of the next few weeks, Intersect ENT senior management, Intersect ENT\u2019s\nadvisors and the Transaction Advisory Committee worked to develop their analyses of the proposed acquisition and\nof Intersect ENT\u2019s various alternatives thereto in order to present their analyses to the full Intersect ENT Board and\nrespond to the Medtronic offer.\nOn July 7, 2020, Intersect ENT\u2019s Transaction Advisory Committee held a meeting via teleconference where members\nof Intersect ENT senior management and Goldman Sachs, relying on certain financial projections prepared by\nIntersect ENT senior management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use, presented a valuation model and analysis\nof the proposed acquisition to Intersect ENT\u2019s Transaction Advisory Committee. Later in the afternoon, after the\nclose of the U.S. financial markets, a Bloomberg article reported that Medtronic had made an offer to acquire Intersect\nENT. On July 7, 2020, shares of Intersect ENT common stock closed on Nasdaq at $13.89 per share.\nOn the morning of July 8, 2020, the Intersect ENT Board held a telephonic meeting with members of Intersect ENT\nsenior management, representatives from Goldman Sachs, and representatives from Cooley in attendance. At the\nmeeting, the Intersect ENT Board discussed the acquisition proposal and determined that the proposed purchase\nprice of $17.50 per share was insufficient to enter into a transaction. The Intersect ENT Board directed the Intersect\nENT senior management team to convey this message to Medtronic.\nOn July 9, 2020, Mr. West contacted Mr. Cleary by telephone and indicated that Medtronic\u2019s proposed purchase price\nwas insufficient to enter into a transaction with Medtronic.\nOn July 9, 2020, Company A, a competitor in the medical device industry, contacted Mr. West to set up a call for the\nfollowing day.\nOn July 10, 2020, Mr. West held a telephonic meeting with a representative of Company A. At the meeting, the\nrepresentative of Company A noted that they were not planning to make an acquisition proposal, but would like to be\nincluded in the process if Intersect ENT decided to engage in a full strategic transaction process.\nOn July 13, 2020, Medtronic sent Mr. West a revised acquisition proposal letter with a purchase price of $18.50 per\nshare.\nOn July 14, 2020, Mr. West and Mr. Cleary spoke by telephone, Mr. West confirmed receipt of the revised offer and\nnoted that he would review the offer with the Intersect ENT Board for consideration the following day.\nOn July 15, 2020, the Intersect ENT Board met with the Intersect ENT senior management team and Intersect ENT\u2019s\nadvisors to discuss the revised offer. After a thorough review of certain financial projections prepared by Intersect\nENT senior management, the operating risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analysis\nand valuation based on these projections and feedback and advice from Cooley, the Intersect ENT Board determined\nthat an offer in the \u201cmid-twenties\u201d would be necessary to proceed and that Mr. West should convey this price target\nto Medtronic. The Intersect ENT Board indicated that the Intersect ENT senior management team should also deliver\na management presentation in order to provide Medtronic with a detailed understanding of Intersect ENT and a high-\nlevel, preliminary view of potential synergies with Medtronic.\nOn July 16, 2020, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary, noting that Intersect ENT would consider a transaction where\nIntersect ENT would be acquired for a purchase price in the mid-20s per share. Mr. Cleary noted that he would\nconsider the proposal.\nOn July 21, 2020, Mr. Cleary contacted Mr. West and both agreed that a management presentation might provide the\nbasis for Medtronic seeing increased value for its bid to meet Intersect ENT\u2019s valuation expectations.\nOn July 28, 2020, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary and finalized the details for the agreed management presentation to\nfurther Medtronic\u2019s understanding of Intersect ENT, subject to entering into a confidentiality agreement, which\nwould provide for, among other terms, a standstill obligation for a minimum period of six months. Mr. Cleary accepted.\nLater that day, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed a confidentiality agreement,\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich included customary terms and a standstill provision for a six-month period. The standstill provision included\ncustomary exclusions such as permitting parties to approach Intersect ENT privately and confidentially and a fall\naway provision upon the entry or public announcement of certain acquisition transactions.\nOn July 29, 2020, members of Intersect ENT senior management held a management presentation for Medtronic.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs were also in attendance.\nFollowing the completion of the management presentation, Intersect ENT reached out to Medtronic to determine if\nany additional questions or data requests would be forthcoming. Medtronic indicated in August 2020 that the\nmanagement presentation had not materially changed its view on valuation. At this time, Intersect ENT was actively\nengaged in pursuing an acquisition of Fiagon AG. Fiagon AG had been considered as a potential distribution partner\nof Intersect ENT prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and consideration of potential strategic options\nwere restarted over the course of the summer of 2020. This led to additional Intersect ENT Board meetings to discuss\nthe timing of moving forward with a potential acquisition of Fiagon AG and whether or not to reach out to Medtronic\nfor a further indication of interest. Because Medtronic had reported that the management presentation had not\nmaterially changed its view on valuation, the Intersect ENT Board resolved to pursue the acquisition of Fiagon AG\nand instructed the Intersect ENT senior management team to proceed on that basis.\nOn September 15, 2020, Intersect ENT\u2019s acquisition of Fiagon AG was announced before the U.S. financial markets\nopened.\nFollowing the announcement of the acquisition of Fiagon AG, there were periodic, high-level conversations between\nIntersect ENT and Medtronic. These conversations did not lead to further discussions regarding potential\ntransaction terms, and Intersect ENT did not engage further with Medtronic during the remainder of 2020 or the first\nhalf of 2021.\nOn July 7, 2021, Mr. Cleary reached out to Intersect ENT seeking to speak with Mr. West.\nOn July 8, 2021, Medtronic sent a letter proposing to acquire Intersect ENT at purchase price of $24.00 per share in\ncash to Mr. Kieran Gallahue, Chairman of the Intersect ENT Board, as Mr. West was not immediately available. Later\nthe same day, Mr. West spoke with Mr. Richard Meier, the chief financial officer of Intersect ENT, to discuss the\nwritten proposal from Medtronic.\nOn the morning of July 10, 2021, the Intersect ENT Board held a telephone conference call to discuss Medtronic\u2019s\nrevised offer of $24.00 per share in cash. Members of Intersect ENT senior management, representatives from\nGoldman Sachs, and representatives from Cooley were in attendance.\nOn July 13, 2021, the Intersect ENT senior management team reviewed in greater detail with the Intersect ENT Board\nthe Medtronic offer at $24.00 per share, as well as the additional financial implications of this offer. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Cooley were also in attendance. At such meeting, the Intersect ENT Board noted that while the\noffer at $24.00 per share was potentially attractive based on a thorough review of certain financial projections, the\noperating risks relating to COVID-19 pandemic, Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analysis and valuation based on the\nprojections and feedback and advice from Cooley, the offer would need to be in the high-20s per share in order for\nIntersect ENT to consider entering into a transaction. In particular, it was noted that the position of Intersect ENT\nhad materially improved over the course of the last year with the demonstrated recovery of PROPEL despite ongoing\nthe COVID-19 pandemic challenges, the office-based business for both PROPEL and SINUVA had expanded and the\naddition of Fiagon navigation and balloon products had taken place. Later that day, Mr. West spoke to Mr. Cleary\nnoting that the Intersect ENT Board would consider an offer in the high-20s per share if such a transaction could be\nconsummated in a prompt manner.\nOn July 19, 2021, Intersect ENT and Medtronic entered into an amendment to the original confidentiality agreement\npreviously entered into on July 28, 2020. The confidentiality agreement included a Medtronic six-month standstill\nperiod. Later that day, Intersect ENT began populating and opened a virtual data room.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 20, 2021, members of Intersect ENT senior management held a management presentation for Medtronic\nemployees across a range of functions. That same day, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed a confidentiality\nagreement for certain highly confidential information relating to Intersect ENT. The Intersect ENT senior management\nteam met with the Intersect ENT Board on a teleconference later in the day to de-brief the Intersect ENT Board on the\nmanagement presentation.\nOn July 21, 2021, Mr. West received a telephone call from Mr. Cleary at Medtronic revising the proposal to $27.00 per\nshare. Later that evening, Mr. West and members of Intersect ENT senior management met with the Transaction\nAdvisory Committee previously established by the Intersect ENT Board to report on the improved Medtronic offer of\n$27.00 per share in cash. The Transaction Advisory Committee and Mr. West agreed to seek $29.50 per share in cash\nin order to maximize the potential value to Intersect ENT stockholders but to also indicate to Medtronic that a price\nbelow $30.00 would be considered. Later that day, Mr. West conveyed to Mr. Cleary the specific price target of $29.50\nper share. Mr. Cleary indicated that $29.50 per share did not constitute any material movement on Intersect ENT\u2019s\npart, despite Medtronic\u2019s improved offer from $24.00 per share to $27.00 per share, and that Medtronic expected a\ncompromise valuation in order to come to an agreement.\nOn July 23, 2021, Mr. Cleary called Mr. West and increased Medtronic\u2019s bid from $27.00 per share in cash to $28.25 per\nshare in cash. A telephonic meeting of the Intersect ENT Board was convened for later that day. The Intersect ENT\nBoard, members of Intersect ENT senior management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Cooley met to\ndiscuss the latest offer. The Intersect ENT Board authorized Mr. West to negotiate towards a price of $28.50 per share\nin cash. However, they noted that Mr. West could accept $28.25 per share in cash. Mr. West contacted Mr. Cleary to\nrequest an increased offer of $28.50 per share. Mr. Cleary agreed to take the counter offer back to Medtronic\nmanagement. Mr. Cleary subsequently called Mr. West indicating that there could be no further movement beyond\n$28.25 per share. Mr. West accepted $28.25 per share as the final offer, noting that he expected Medtronic to conclude\nits diligence within an agreed time frame and in the ordinary course for public company transactions. Mr. West\ncommunicated the outcome of the negotiation and the agreement for $28.25 per share to the Intersect ENT Board.\nThat same day, Intersect ENT granted data room access to Medtronic and its legal advisors.\nOn July 27, 2021 and July 28, 2021, a team from Medtronic visited Intersect ENT\u2019s Menlo Park, California facility for\nthe purposes of conducting onsite due diligence. The focus of diligence was on operations, quality, regulatory and\nproduct innovation. Members of Intersect ENT senior management were also in attendance throughout.\nOn July 27, 2021, Ropes & Gray LLP, Medtronic\u2019s outside legal counsel (\u201cRopes\u201d), sent an initial draft of the Merger\nAgreement to Cooley. The initial draft of the Merger Agreement proposed, among other things, an Intersect ENT\ntermination fee of 3.75% of the transaction value and a Medtronic termination fee of 3.75% of the transaction value.\nOn August 1, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among other\nthings, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 2.5% of the transaction value and a Medtronic termination fee equal to the\ngreater of (i) the aggregate amount outstanding under the unsecured loan to be entered into during the pre-closing\nperiod between Intersect ENT and Medtronic and (ii) 10% of the transaction value. Cooley also sent Ropes an initial\ndraft of the financing term sheet, which included an interest rate of 3.25% and did not include a cap on amounts\nIntersect ENT could borrow.\nOn August 2, 2021, Ropes sent Cooley a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed, among other\nthings, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 3.5% of the transaction value and removed the proposed Medtronic\ntermination fee. That same day, Ropes sent Cooley a revised draft of the financing term sheet, which included a cap\non the amounts Intersect ENT could borrow under the unsecured loan, ranging from $75-$90 million, and an interest\nrate of 7.5%. The parties continued to negotiate the term sheet until August 5, 2021, ultimately agreeing to a cap of\n$75 million under the unsecured loan and an interest rate of 5%.\nOn August 2, 2021, representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered a relationship disclosure letter to the Intersect ENT\nsenior management team who provided it to the Intersect ENT Board, providing information regarding certain of\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 relationships with certain affiliates of Medtronic, which the Intersect ENT Board did not believe\nwould adversely affect Goldman Sachs\u2019 independence.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 3, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes the initial draft of the disclosure schedules, which the parties continued to\nrevise and negotiate until immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement.\nOn August 3, 2021, Intersect ENT entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs, whereby Goldman Sachs\nwould act as the exclusive financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of Intersect ENT and undertake a\nstudy to enable Goldman Sachs to render an opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the financial\nconsideration to be paid to stockholders of Intersect ENT in connection with the sale of the shares of its outstanding\ncommon stock.\nOn August 4, 2021, Cooley sent Ropes a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which draft proposed, among other\nthings, an Intersect ENT termination fee of 2.65% of the transaction value and a proposed Medtronic termination fee\nin the form of forgiveness of the unsecured loan. Later that day, Ropes returned the draft Merger Agreement to\nCooley, which draft proposed among other things a 2.8% Intersect ENT termination fee and a cap on the amount of\nthe Medtronic termination fee not to exceed $75 million.\nOn August 5, 2021, Cooley and Ropes exchanged further drafts of the Merger Agreement.\nOn that same day, the Intersect ENT Board held a videoconference with representatives of Intersect ENT senior\nmanagement, Cooley and Goldman Sachs, to consider the definitive deal documents, including the Merger\nAgreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs orally rendered its opinion to the Intersect ENT Board, subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of August 5, 2021 and based upon and subject to\nvarious assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such opinion, the $28.25 in cash per\nshare to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of\nshares of Intersect ENT common stock, in their capacity as such holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates), was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates). For more information\nabout Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, see below under the caption \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d.\nFollowing that delivery, representatives of Cooley provided a review for the Intersect ENT Board of its fiduciary\nduties and reviewed certain material terms of the proposed final Merger Agreement, including (i) key closing\nconditions such as antitrust approval and a detailed discussion relating to the potential antitrust risks involved with\nthe transaction, (ii) restrictions on Intersect ENT\u2019s ability to operate its business between sign and close, (iii) the\ntreatment of equity awards, (iv) a \u201cno-shop\u201d restriction requiring Intersect ENT to cease all third-party negotiations\nor discussions and prohibiting Intersect ENT from further soliciting other acquisition proposals (subject to a\nfiduciary out for a superior proposal), (v) the interim loan facility for up to $75 million with an interest rate of 5% per\nannum, (vi) the 2.8% termination fee to be paid by Intersect ENT if the agreement is terminated due to the acceptance\nof a superior proposal, a Intersect ENT Board recommendation change or in the event of termination under certain\nother circumstances if Intersect ENT entered into an alternative agreement within one year thereafter, and (vii) the\ntermination fee payable by Medtronic in an amount equal to the amount of the interim term loan outstanding if the\ntransaction failed due to antitrust reasons. Representatives of Cooley answered questions from members of the\nIntersect ENT Board regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. After the presentation by Cooley, the Intersect\nENT Board continued to discuss the potential transaction with Medtronic, Intersect ENT\u2019s various alternatives\nthereto and the reasons that the Intersect ENT Board believed that the proposed Merger with Medtronic, Merger\nAgreement and other transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable and in the best interests of Intersect ENT\nand its stockholders. For more information concerning the recommendation of the Intersect ENT Board, see the\nsection titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Reasons for the Merger.\u201d Following such discussion, the Intersect ENT Board\nunanimously determined that the Merger, Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby were\nadvisable and in the best interests of Intersect ENT and its stockholders, and authorized Intersect ENT senior\nmanagement to execute the final Merger Agreement and related definitive documents with Medtronic.\nOn August 6, 2021, Intersect ENT and Medtronic executed the Merger Agreement.\nThe same day, and prior to the opening of the U.S. stock markets and the announcement of Intersect ENT\u2019s second\nquarter earnings release, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement,\nwhich Intersect ENT filed later that morning with a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

the Merger and the Transactions are fair to and in the\nbest interests of Intersect ENT and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger\nAgreement\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the\nCompany at the Special Meeting\u037e and (iv) subject to the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,\nresolved to recommend, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that all Intersect ENT stockholders to approve the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.\nThe Intersect ENT Board unanimously recommends, on behalf of Intersect ENT, that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadoption the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n(3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there\nare insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nThe Intersect ENT Board considered the following reasons (which are not listed in any relative order of importance),\nall of which it viewed as generally supporting its decision:\n\u2022\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration of $28.25 in cash and the current and historical trading price of\nIntersect ENT\u2019s common stock, including that the Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium\nof:\n\u2022\napproximately 45.1% to the 30-day volume weighted average price of Intersect ENT common stock of\n$19.46, ending on July 30, 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\napproximately 15.2% to $24.52, the closing price of Intersect ENT\u2019s common stock on August 5, 2021,\nthe last full trading day prior to public announcement of Intersect ENT\u2019s entry into the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented the highest price that Medtronic was willing\nto pay (see above under the caption \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d), and the highest price per\nshare value reasonably obtainable as of the date of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, during the course of negotiations with Medtronic (see above under the caption \u201cThe Merger-\nBackground of the Merger\u201d), Medtronic increased the price per share to be paid to Intersect ENT\u2019s\nstockholders from $24.00 per share on July 8, 2021 to $28.25 per share by July 23, 2021, a 17.7% premium to\nthe initial offer from Medtronic\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Medtronic in the event Intersect ENT continued\ntrying to obtain any additional offers at higher prices\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the all-cash Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid by Medtronic provides Intersect ENT\nstockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares upon the completion of the Merger and\ndoes not expose them to any subsequent risks related to the business or the financial markets generally, as\ncompared to a transaction in which Intersect ENT stockholders receive shares or other securities, or as\ncompared to Intersect ENT remaining independent\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Intersect ENT Board\u2019s views of the potential rewards, risks and uncertainties inherent in Intersect\nENT\u2019s business, including risks associated with management\u2019s standalone plan, Intersect ENT\u2019s financial\nperformance, market conditions (including the ongoing risks and uncertainties around COVID-19 and\nrelated variants on return to work and day-to-day operations of Intersect ENT) and changing competitive\ndynamics\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration is more favorable to stockholders than the potential\nvalue that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives available to\nIntersect ENT, which could include: (i) the continuation of Intersect ENT\u2019s business plan as an\nindependent enterprise, as assessed based on its historical results of operations, financial prospects and\ncondition\u037e and (ii) modifications to Intersect ENT\u2019s business and operations strategy\u037e\n27TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe belief that the aforementioned other alternatives were not reasonably likely to create greater value for\nIntersect ENT\u2019s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account, among other variables, execution risks\nas well as operational, competitive, regulatory, industry and market risks, particularly those in the\nhealthcare industry more generally\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Medtronic has sufficient financial resources to fund the aggregate purchase price, payments\nrequired to holders of the 4.0% unsecured senior convertible notes issued pursuant to the Deerfield\nConvertible Facility Agreement (as defined below) (the \u201cDeerfield Convertible Notes\u201d) arising as a result of\nthe Merger, the unsecured subordinated loan facility contemplated by the Merger Agreement and fees and\nexpenses required to be paid at the Closing of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of August 5,\n2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations, and other matters set\nforth in such written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than\nMedtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described below\nunder the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d\nthe full text of which written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement in its entirety\u037e\n\u2022\nthe likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be\ncompleted, particularly in light of certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe commitment of Medtronic in the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to complete\nthe Merger, including its commitment to negotiate, agree to and consummate the sale, divestiture,\nlicense or other disposition of the Fiagon Business, irrespective of economic consequences, as\npromptly as practicable and in any event such that such sale, divestiture, license or other disposition\nmay be consummated in advance of the End Date (subject to certain limitations described in the\nMerger Agreement, as described below under the caption \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Antitrust\nActions\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the aggregate amounts outstanding under the unsecured subordinated loans provided by\nMedtronic pursuant to the Merger Agreement (i.e., an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million\nto be funded, at the option of Intersect ENT, in five tranches of $15 million per fiscal quarter) plus all\naccrued and unpaid interest thereunder shall no longer be due and payable to Medtronic if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of Medtronic to obtain\nrequisite regulatory clearance or a breach by Medtronic of certain regulatory covenants (subject to a\ncure period)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Medtronic\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon, nor limited by,\nthe receipt of third-party debt financing or the completion of any marketing period\u037e\n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are customary in number and\nscope, and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Intersect ENT\u2019s\nrepresentations and warranties, are generally subject to a \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d qualification (see\nbelow under the caption \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d for more\ninformation)\u037e and\n\u2022\nIntersect ENT\u2019s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement permitting Intersect ENT to respond to unsolicited alternative\nproposals and the related terms of the Merger Agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability, under certain circumstances after the Agreement Date, to furnish information to, and\nconduct negotiations with, third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nIntersect ENT\u2019s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal,\nsubject to certain conditions of the Merger Agreement and paying Medtronic a termination fee of\n$29.25 million (see below under the caption \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Fees and Expenses\u037e Termination\nFee\u201d)\u037e\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Intersect ENT Board believed and continues to believe that the termination fee of\n$29.25 million, which is approximately 2.8% of the implied transaction value of the Merger, is\nreasonable, is within the market averages for such fees payable in comparable transactions, and is not\npreclusive of, or a substantial impediment to, other offers\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the adoption of the Merger Agreement is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of\nthe shares of Intersect ENT\u2019s common stock, and Intersect ENT\u2019s stockholders would be able to reject the\nMerger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to Intersect ENT\u2019s stockholders who do\nnot vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures\nunder Delaware law, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware\ncourt determine the fair value of their shares, which may be determined to be more than, less than, or the\nsame as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of Intersect ENT to generally continue to operate its business in the ordinary course and\nconsistent with its operating plan during the pre-closing period\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that Medtronic agreed to provide Intersect ENT with pre-closing financing pursuant to an\nunsecured subordinated loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million to be funded, at\nthe option of Intersect ENT, in five tranches of $15 million per fiscal quarter, as described further below\nunder the caption \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Unsecured Subordinated Loan Facility\u201d.\nThe Intersect ENT Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the\nfollowing reasons (which reasons are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that Intersect ENT would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and\nstockholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any\npotential future appreciation in value of Intersect ENT\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to Intersect ENT if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner,\nincluding the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on our business\nand relationships with customers, partners and employees\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Medtronic\u2019s commitments in the Merger Agreement to seek to complete the Merger are subject\nto specified limitations and that the necessary antitrust clearances to complete the Merger might not be\nobtained in a timely manner, or at all (see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Antitrust Actions\u201d\nfor more information)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that Intersect ENT pay to Medtronic a termination fee of $29.25 million, under certain\ncircumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Intersect ENT Board\nterminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or Medtronic terminates the Merger\nAgreement based on a knowing, material breach by Intersect ENT of the non-solicitation provisions of the\nMerger Agreement or if the Intersect ENT Board changes its recommendation (see below under the caption\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement- Fees and Expenses\u037e Termination Fee\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Intersect ENT\u2019s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which\nmay delay or prevent Intersect ENT from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the\ncompletion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT might have pursued\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that an all cash transaction would generally be taxable to Intersect ENT\u2019s stockholders that are U.S.\npersons for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Intersect ENT is unable to solicit other Acquisition\nProposals after the Agreement Date until the termination of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the\nMerger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time\nand effort of Intersect ENT management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business\noperations and have a negative effect on its financial results\u037e\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement

thereby addresses the information and reasons considered by the\nIntersect ENT Board in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of reasons considered by the\nIntersect ENT Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the\nIntersect ENT Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the\nspecific reasons considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information\nand reasons described above, each individual member of the Intersect ENT Board applied his or her own personal\nbusiness judgment to the decision-making process and may have given differing weights to differing reasons. The\nIntersect ENT Board based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The\nexplanation of the reasons and reasoning set forth above contains forward-looking statements that should be read in\nconjunction with the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Intersect ENT Board that, as of August 5, 2021, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.25 in cash per share of Intersect ENT common stock\nto be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common\nstock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of the\nwritten opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 5, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Intersect ENT\nBoard in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to\nhow any holder of shares of Intersect ENT common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman\nSachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Intersect ENT for the five fiscal years\nended December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Intersect ENT\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Intersect ENT to its stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Intersect ENT\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Intersect ENT, which include the estimated benefits of\nIntersect ENT\u2019s net operating losses, prepared by management of Intersect ENT, as approved for Goldman\nSachs\u2019 use by Intersect ENT, referred to in this section as the \u201cForecasts\u201d.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Intersect ENT regarding their\nassessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Intersect ENT\u037e\nreviewed the reported price and trading activity for Intersect ENT common stock\u037e compared certain\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfinancial and stock market information for Intersect ENT with similar information for certain other companies the\nsecurities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the\nmedical technology industry and in other industries\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered\nsuch other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Intersect ENT\u2019s consent, relied upon and assumed the\naccuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,\ndiscussed with or reviewed by it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that\nregard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Intersect ENT\u2019s consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a\nbasis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Intersect ENT. Goldman\nSachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent,\nderivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Intersect ENT or any of its subsidiaries, and Goldman\nSachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental,\nregulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without\nany adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also\nassumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or\nmodification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Intersect ENT to engage in the\nMerger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to\nIntersect ENT\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\naddresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $28.25 in cash per share\nof Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding\nshares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express\nany view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any term or\naspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in\nconnection with the Merger, including, the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection\ntherewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Intersect ENT\u037e nor as to\nthe fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or\nemployees of Intersect ENT, or class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $28.25 in\ncash per share of Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates) of\nthe outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman\nSachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Intersect ENT common stock will trade at\nany time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Intersect ENT, Medtronic\nor the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Intersect ENT, Medtronic or Merger\nSub, or the ability of Intersect ENT, Medtronic or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come\ndue. In addition, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other\nconditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion, and Goldman Sachs\nassumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or\nevents occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of\nGoldman Sachs.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Intersect ENT Board\nin connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries\nof the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the\nfull text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on\nmarket data as it existed on or before August 4, 2021, the last trading day before Goldman Sachs orally rendered its\nopinion to the Intersect ENT Board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nImplied Premia Analysis\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia described below based on the $28.25 in cash per share to\nbe paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the Per Share Merger Consideration relative to:\n\u2022\n$24.52, the closing trading price of the shares on August 5, 2021, the last trading day before the\nannouncement of the Merger (which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$26.62, the highest closing trading price per share for the 52-week period ended August 5, 2021 (which we\nrefer to as the \u201c52-Week High Price\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$15.14, the lowest closing trading price per share for the 52-week period ended August 5, 2021 (which we\nrefer to as the \u201c52-Week Low Price\u201d).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:\nImplied Premium \nRepresented by $28.25 in\nPer \nShare Merger\nConsideration\nReference Price Per Share:\nCurrent Share Price of $24.52\n15.2%\n52-Week High Price of $26.62\n6.1%\n52-Week Low Price of $15.14\n86.6%\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Intersect ENT to\nderive a range of illustrative present values per share.\nUsing discount rates ranging from 9.50% to 10.50%, reflecting estimates of Intersect ENT\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital, utilizing a mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Intersect\nENT, by discounting to present value as of June 30, 2021, (a) estimates of the unlevered free cash flow to be\ngenerated by Intersect ENT for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2035, including the estimated tax savings\nassociated with Intersect ENT\u2019s net operating losses during such period, all as reflected in the Forecasts, and (b) a\nrange of illustrative terminal values for Intersect ENT, calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from\n2.5% to 3.5% to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by Intersect ENT, as reflected\nin the Forecasts (which analysis implied a range of multiples of next twelve-month terminal EBITDA (defined as\noperating income plus depreciation and amortization (excluding transaction-related amortization)) of 9.5x to 12.8x).\nGoldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including Intersect ENT\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt,\nfuture applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Intersect ENT, as well as certain financial metrics for the United\nStates financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term\nreal growth of gross domestic product and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Intersect ENT by adding the range of present\nvalues it derived in step (a) as described in the above paragraph to the range of present values it derived in step (b)\nas described in the above paragraph. Goldman Sachs then subtracted Intersect ENT\u2019s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as\nprovided by management of Intersect ENT, from such combined range to derive a range of illustrative equity values\nfor Intersect ENT. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the total number of\nfully diluted shares outstanding as of August 2, 2021 calculated using treasury stock method, and assuming a $60\nmillion dollar equity offering in the second half of 2021 at a 15% discount to the $24.48 current stock price, in each\ncase as provided by the management of Intersect ENT, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of\n$22.06 to $28.37.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share\nof Intersect ENT common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the calendar years\n2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value of Intersect ENT as of December 31 for each\nof the calendar years 2021 to 2023, by multiplying the one-year forward revenue as of such date by an illustrative\nrange of multiples of 4.5x to 6.5x. These illustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional\njudgment and experience based on various factors, including Intersect ENT\u2019s historical trading multiples as well as\nthe historical trading multiples of comparable public companies. To derive illustrative implied equity values per\nIntersect ENT common stock, Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Intersect ENT\u2019s projected net debt as of\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, as provided by management of Intersect ENT, from the range of\nimplied enterprise values. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully diluted\nshares outstanding, as provided by management of Intersect ENT and calculated using treasury stock method, to\ndetermine implied equity values per share of Intersect ENT common stock as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\nGoldman Sachs then discounted these implied equity values per share to June 30, 2021, using a discount rate of\n10.0%, reflecting an estimate of Intersect ENT\u2019s cost of equity. These analyses resulted in a range of implied present\nvalues of $19.02 to $30.16 per share.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to certain acquisition transactions announced\nover the last 10 years involving target companies in the medical technology industry with an implied enterprise value\nranging from $500 million to $4 billion.\nWhile none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Intersect ENT and none of\nthe selected transactions are directly comparable to the Merger, the target companies in the selected transactions are\ncompanies with certain operations that, for the purposes of analysis, Goldman Sachs considered to be sufficiently\nsimilar, in its judgement, to certain operations of Intersect ENT based on various factors, including those in the\nmedical technology sector in some cases with similar characteristics in some respects as Intersect ENT.\nUsing publicly available information, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied\nenterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction, as a\nmultiple of the estimated revenue of the target company for the last twelve-month (\u201cLTM Revenue\u201d) period ended\nprior to announcement of each applicable transaction, as disclosed in public company filings and other publicly\navailable information. The selected transactions and the implied enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples\ncalculated for the transactions are set forth below:\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEV\n($bn)\nEV / LTM \nRevenue\nApril 29, 2013\nBayer HealthCare LLC\nConceptus, Inc.\n1.1\n7.9x\nDecember 8, 2013\nCovidien plc\nGiven Imaging Ltd.\n0.9\n5.2x\nJuly 22, 2015\nSt. Jude Medical, Inc.\nThoratec Corporation\n3.4\n7.2x\nFebruary 1, 2016\nStryker Corporation\nSage Products, LLC\n2.8\n6.5x\nJune 7, 2016\nZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\nLDR Holding Corporation\n1.0\n6.2x\nDecember 2, 2016\nTeleflex Incorporated\nVascular Solutions, Inc.\n1.0\n6.0x\nDecember 20, 2016\nAllergan plc\nAcelity L.P.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses of the various\ntransactions and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of enterprise\nvalue to LTM EBITDA multiples of 5.0x to 8.0x to Intersect ENT\u2019s LTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 to derive a range\nof implied enterprise values for Intersect ENT. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values\n(a) cash payment to holders of Intersect ENT\u2019s options, RSUs, performance-based options, PSUs, and convertible\ndebt and (b) Intersect ENT\u2019s net debt as of June 30, 2021, as provided by management of Intersect ENT, and divided\nthe result by the implied total number of basic shares outstanding as of August 2, 2021, based on the derived range\nof illustrative equity values, to derive a range of implied values per share of $14.70 to $22.70.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, the premia paid in acquisitions of publicly\ntraded companies in the United States announced during the period from January 1, 2016 through August 4, 2021 in\nwhich the target company had an implied enterprise value of $0.5 billion to $4.0 billion. For the entire period from\nJanuary 1, 2016 through August 4, 2021, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the\npremia paid in acquisitions announced during such period relative to the target company\u2019s unaffected stock price at\nthe close of trading on the day prior to the original announcement of the transaction.\nBased on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a\nreference range of illustrative premia of 9%-41% (based on the 25th percentile and 75th percentile of the premia paid in\nacquisitions announced in the entire period relative to the target company\u2019s share price over the 1-trading day prior\nto the original announcement of the transaction) to the closing price per share on August 4, 2021 of $24.48. This\nanalysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of $26.67 to $34.53.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Intersect ENT or\nMedtronic or the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Intersect ENT\nBoard as to the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders (other than\nMedtronic and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Intersect ENT common stock of the $28.25 in cash per share\nof Intersect ENT common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do\nnot purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may\nbe sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently\nsubject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their\nrespective advisors, none of Intersect ENT, Medtronic, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if\nfuture results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe consideration of $28.25 in cash per share of Intersect ENT common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between Intersect ENT and Medtronic and was approved by the Intersect ENT Board. Goldman Sachs\nprovided advice to Intersect ENT during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any\nspecific amount of consideration to Intersect ENT or the Intersect ENT Board or that any specific amount of\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Intersect ENT Board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Intersect ENT Board in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The\nforegoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in\nconnection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman\nSachs attached as Annex B.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in\nwhich they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold\nor vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of Intersect ENT, Medtronic, any of their respective affiliates and third\nparties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor\nto Intersect ENT in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Intersect ENT and/or its\naffiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,\ncompensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Intersect ENT in connection with its acquisition of\nFiagon AG Medical Technologies in October 2020, and as financial advisor to Intersect ENT in connection with its\nconvertible notes financing in May 2020. During the two-year period ended August 5, 2021, the Investment Banking\nDivision of Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services\nprovided by its Investment Banking Division to Intersect ENT and/or its affiliates of approximately $4 million.\nGoldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Medtronic and/or its affiliates\nfrom time to time for which Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive,\ncompensation, including having acted as co-manager to Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A., an affiliate of Medtronic,\nin connection with its senior notes offering in September 2020. During the two-year period ended August 5, 2021, the\nInvestment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or\nunderwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Medtronic and/or its affiliates of approximately\n$500,000. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Intersect\nENT, Medtronic and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division may receive\ncompensation.\nThe Intersect ENT Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger, including with respect\nto acquisitions of public companies in the medical technology industry. Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated\nAugust 3, 2021, Intersect ENT engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger.\nThe engagement letter between Intersect ENT and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of approximately $18\nmillion, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Intersect ENT has agreed to\nreimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify\nGoldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.",

        "Section Text": "Management Projections\nWhile Intersect ENT has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning aspects of its expected financial\nperformance from time to time, Intersect ENT does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal\nprojections as to future performance or results of operations due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying\nassumptions and projections. However, in the second quarter of 2020, in connection with Intersect ENT\u2019s initial\nevaluation of Medtronic\u2019s first proposal, Intersect ENT\u2019s management, at the direction of the Board, prepared certain\nnon-public, unaudited, long-range financial projections (collectively, the \u201cInitial Projections\u201d). Such Initial Projections\nwere provided to Medtronic by Intersect ENT\u2019s senior management.\nSubsequently, in the third quarter of 2021, Intersect ENT updated certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial\ninformation for fiscal years 2021 through 2035 in connection with Medtronic\u2019s subsequent proposal to purchase\nIntersect ENT at a price per share of $28.25 (such non-public, unaudited prospective financial information, the\n\u201cProjections\u201d). Intersect ENT management provided the Projections to the Board and, after review, the Board\napproved such Projections. At the direction of the Board, Intersect ENT management provided the Projections to\nGoldman Sachs. The Board directed Goldman Sachs to use the Projections in connection with rendering its fairness\nopinion and providing its financial analysis to the Board in connection with the Board\u2019s evaluation of potential\nstrategic alternatives, including the Merger. The Projections were also provided to Medtronic in July 2021.\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), nor were they prepared with a view toward compliance\n35TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith the published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of projections of prospective financial information. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used in the Projections were relied upon by the Board in connection with its consideration of the\nMerger and the merger consideration. While Intersect ENT believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide\nuseful supplemental information in analyzing Intersect ENT\u2019s unaudited prospective financial performance, there are\nlimitations associated with the use of such financial measures. Such non-GAAP measures as used by Intersect ENT\nmay not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in\nisolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. The SEC rules, which\notherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure, do not apply\nto non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in connection with a proposed\nbusiness combination transaction such as the proposed Transactions if the disclosure is included in a document\nsuch as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to a GAAP financial\nmeasure were not provided to or relied upon by the Board or Goldman Sachs in connection with the Merger.\nAccordingly, Intersect ENT has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Projections to\nthe relevant GAAP financial measures. The Projections may differ from published analyst estimates and forecasts,\nand do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared, including the\nannouncement of the Transactions.\nThe Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by Intersect ENT management with respect to general\nbusiness, economic, competitive, regulatory and other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of\nwhich are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Intersect ENT\u2019s control. In particular, the Projections,\nwhile presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions (as\ndescribed below) that are inherently uncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they\nbecome subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that\nwill have an effect on Intersect ENT\u2019s business and its results of operations.\nThe Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding Intersect ENT in its public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by Intersect\nENT management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and\ntherefore the Projections do not give effect to the Transactions or any changes to Intersect ENT\u2019s operations or\nstrategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs incurred in connection\nwith the Transactions. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the\nTransactions to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The inclusion of the\nProjections in this proxy should not be regarded as an indication that Intersect ENT, its advisors or anyone who\nreceived the Projections then considered, or now considers, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual\nfuture events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. Intersect ENT management views the\nProjections as being subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such long-range projections.\nNon-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow contained in the Projections set forth below are each\n\u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and\nmay be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations\ninherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included\nin a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and\nnot as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The information set forth below is\nincluded solely to give Intersect ENT stockholders access to financial projections that were made available to the\nBoard and Goldman Sachs and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder\u2019s\ndecision to vote with respect to the Merger Proposal or for any other purpose.\nFor purposes of calculating the Projections, Intersect ENT management made several assumptions based on their\nreasonable business judgment, including assuming a return to growth in 2021, the continued market penetration of\nPROPEL\u00ae and SINUVA\u00ae, the successful launch of the VenSure product line and the CUBE 4D\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsystem, the positive outcomes of the OM1 Study and the EXPAND trial, the further segmentation of the surgical and\noffice markets, the growth and penetration of international markets, the ongoing success of the R&D pipeline, and\nthe continued ability to execute inorganic products transactions. In addition, the Projections include a return to\nhistoric gross margins in the legacy products, the successful implementations of global IT systems to improve\nproductivity and continuing access to capital markets to fund operations and activities.\nThe following table sets forth the Projections:\n(dollars in millions)\n6 Mo. \nEnded\n2021E 2022E 2023E 2024E 2025E 2026E 2027E 2028E 2029E 2030E 2031E 2032E 2033E 2034E 2035E\nTotal Revenue\n$70\n$158\n$199\n$236\n$284\n$328\n$384\n$446\n$491\n$543\n$598\n$647\n$690\n$722\n$744\nOperating\nIncome\n($24) ($48) ($15) $1\n1\n$48\n$60\n$75\n$94\n$110\n$136\n$149\n$162\n$172\n$181\n$186\nUFCF(1)\n($45) ($64) ($31) $8\n$36\n$43\n$54\n$68\n$82\n$102\n$113\n$123\n$132\n$140\n$145\nUnlevered free cash flow refers to operating income, less cash taxes, capital expenditures, changes in net working capital, and\ndelayed consideration to Fiagon, plus depreciation and amortization and is burdened by stock-based compensation.

        "Section Text": "Closing and Effective Time\nThe closing of the Merger will take place on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver in\naccordance with the Merger Agreement of all of the conditions to closing of the Merger (as described under the\ncaption, \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d), other than\nconditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such\nconditions.\nAppraisal Rights\nStockholders of Intersect ENT (i) who continuously hold shares through the Effective Time, (ii) who did not vote\ntheir shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under\nSection 262 of the DGCL, (iv) who otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of\nSection 262 of the DGCL\u037e and (v) who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to\nperfect or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be\nentitled to demand appraisal of their shares and receive, if the Merger is successful and the Merger is consummated,\nin lieu of the Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares (as of the Effective\nTime, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with\ninterest, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nStockholders should be aware that the fair value of their Shares could be more than, the same as or less than the\nMerger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nconsideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise\naddress, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any stockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal\nrights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the procedural steps required to\nproperly demand and perfect such rights.\nThe following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders that wish to exercise their appraisal\nrights under Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy as Annex C. This summary\ndoes not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the\nDGCL. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder\nof shares immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as\n43TABLE OF CONTENTS\nto which appraisal rights are asserted. A person holding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name\nof another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the stockholder of record to follow the\nsteps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to follow any of the\nprocedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in termination or waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262\nof the DGCL. Stockholders should assume that Intersect ENT will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of\nany stockholder.\nAny stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the\nDGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that\nCompany stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders entitled\nto appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThis proxy statement constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the\nrequired copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. Any stockholder who\nwishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the\nfollowing discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures\nspecified may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nIf a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\ndeliver to Intersect ENT at the address indicated below a written demand for appraisal of his, her or its\nshares prior to the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, which written demand must\nreasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand\nappraisal of his, her or its shares. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate\nfrom any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d or failing to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a\ndemand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e\n\u2022\nnot vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made\nthrough the Effective Time of the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\ncomply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including\nfiling of a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of your\nshares of common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger.\nWithin 10 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective\ndate of the Merger to those stockholders of Intersect ENT who have properly made a written demand for appraisal\npursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL, have not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and have not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is\nconsummated, a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the\nfirst bullet above (or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a\ntermination of your appraisal rights. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any\nstockholder who has demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, without\ninterest, specified by the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60\ndays after the Effective Time of the Merger will require the written approval of the Surviving Corporation and no\nappraisal proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the\napproval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has\nmade an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time of the Merger. If the\nSurviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder\u2019s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when the\napproval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding,\nthe stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding.\nThis value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nWritten Demand by the Stockholder\nAll written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Intersect ENT, Inc., 1555 Adams Drive, Menlo Park,\nCalifornia 94025. Attention: General Counsel. The demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of\nrecord, fully and correctly, as such stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s certificates (whether in book\nentry or on physical certificates) evidencing such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned of record in a\nfiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be made in that capacity, and if\nthe shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand\nmust be made by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute\nthe demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record, but such agent must identify the record owner or owners and\nexpressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners of such shares.\nA beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions\nas may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If\nshares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central\nsecurities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any\nbeneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible\nfor ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record. The beneficial holder of the\nshares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record\nof the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.\nA record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee\nfor several beneficial owners (may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial\nowners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the\nwritten demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a demand for\nappraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such\nstockholder.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any\nstockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their\nshares in favor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that\n120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their\nshares. None of Parent, Merger Sub or Intersect ENT, as the Surviving Corporation, has any obligation to or has any\npresent intention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a\npetition or will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of\nthe stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the\nperiod prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the\nDGCL and the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights set forth herein will be entitled, upon written request, to\nreceive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received, and the\naggregate number of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written\nrequest therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing\nrequirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person\nwho is the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to\nwhich demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition\nfor appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the\npetition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names\nand addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the \u201cDissenting Stockholders\u201d)\nand with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a\nDissenting Stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place\nfixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders\nshown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a\nnewspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed\nadvisable by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving\nCorporation.\nIf a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting\nStockholders have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their\nshares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting Stockholders submit their share certificates, if\nany, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does\nnot comply with such requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share\ncertificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with all orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect\nof such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately\nbefore the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the\nappraisal proceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal\nexceeds 1% of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the\nMerger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal\nproceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the fair value of the shares as of the Effective Time exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to\nbe the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of payment of\nthe judgment. However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may\npay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only\nupon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair value\nof the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash\npayment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201cfair price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market\nvalue, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be\nascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to\nbe \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion that does not\nencompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from\nsuch accomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be\nmore than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the Verified List\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is\nrequired, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to\nappraisal rights. When the fair value of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the\npayment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled thereto, forthwith in the case of\nuncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates. The Delaware\nCourt of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019\nfees or the fees and expenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder, order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any\nDissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to\nappraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nStockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to\nbe paid in the Merger. Although Intersect ENT believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is\nmade as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither\nParent nor Intersect ENT anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and\neach of Parent and Intersect ENT reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section\n262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares is less than the Merger Consideration.\nThe process of dissenting and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites.\nStockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with\ncompliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL\nwill not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of\ndividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date\nprior to the Effective Time.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully\nwithdraws or loses such stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares will be deemed to have been\nconverted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, the stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as Intersect ENT has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present\nintention to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely basis. In addition, a\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger\nConsideration by delivering to Intersect ENT a written withdrawal of such\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of the Merger either within 60 days after the effective\ndate of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of Intersect ENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\nappraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval\nof the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the effective\ndate of the Merger.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL\nNOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL\nRECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of Intersect ENT to seek appraisal rights under Delaware\nlaw does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of Intersect\nENT desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nSection 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions\nof the DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this Proxy.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Matters\nGeneral\nSubject to certain limitations, Parent has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary\nto obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or in connection with antitrust laws, and to enable all\nwaiting periods under applicable antitrust laws to terminate or expire, and to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or\neliminate each and every impediment under applicable antitrust laws asserted by any governmental entity, in each\ncase, to cause the Merger to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the End Date. This includes,\nfor example, making an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as\npracticable, and to make all other filings required or advisable by applicable foreign antitrust laws with respect to the\nMerger as promptly as practicable.\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisitions may not be completed until\ninformation has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal\nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable HSR Act waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act is 30 calendar days, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier (provided, however, that\nthe FTC has temporarily suspended granting early termination other than in narrow circumstances that do not apply\nduring the initial 30 day waiting period), extended by a request for additional information and documentary material,\nor restarted if Parent voluntarily withdraws and refiles to allow a second 30 calendar day waiting period. The Merger\nis subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until Intersect ENT and Parent file a\nnotification and report form with the FTC and the DOJ under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has\nexpired or been terminated. Intersect ENT and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust\nDivision of the DOJ on August 23, 2021. Intersect ENT and Parent may also file pre-merger or post-merger\nnotification filings, forms or submissions with other governmental entities pursuant to other applicable antitrust laws\nin connection with the Merger.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could investigate the Merger or take such action\n50TABLE OF CONTENTS\nunder the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets or business lines of the parties, seeking to impose\nconditions or limitations on one or both parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and\nnotwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign\njurisdiction could investigate the Merger or take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or\ndesirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets or business lines of the parties, seeking to impose conditions or limitations on one or\nboth parties, or seeking to require the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and\ncontractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,\nwe will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nOne or more governmental agencies, including government agencies outside the United States, may impose a\ncondition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary consents, clearances or\napprovals. Third parties may seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or prevent consummation\nof the Merger, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory\nconsents, clearances or approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the\nrequired regulatory consents, clearances or approvals or whether they will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required termination or expiration of waiting periods and any required regulatory\nconsents, clearances or approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these will be timely obtained, obtained\nat all or that they will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including\nthe requirement to divest assets or business lines, agree to certain conditions or limitations, or require changes to the\nterms of the Merger Agreement. These could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.\nLegal Proceedings\nSubsequent to the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement on August 27, 2021, a civil action was filed challenging\nthe adequacy of certain public disclosures made by Intersect ENT concerning Intersect ENT's proposed transaction\nwith Medtronic. On September 1, 2021, Elaine Wang, a purported stockholder of Intersect ENT, commenced an action\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Elaine Wang v. Intersect ENT,\nInc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-7348, against Intersect ENT and current members of the Intersect ENT Board. The Wang\nComplaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks, among other things, an\ninjunction preventing consummation of the proposed transaction with Medtronic, rescission of the proposed\ntransaction or rescissory damages in the event it is consummated, an accounting by the defendants for all damages\ncaused to the plaintiff, and the award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Intersect ENT and the current members of the\nIntersect ENT Board have not been served with the Wang Complaint. Defendants believe the claims asserted in these\ncomplaints are without merit, deny any wrongdoing in connection with the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement,\nand intend to vigorously defend against the claims.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

The descriptions of the Merger\nAgreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are\ngoverned by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information\ncontained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the\nrepresentations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating\ncontractual risk between Intersect ENT, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may\nbe subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.\nStockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of Intersect ENT, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses.
