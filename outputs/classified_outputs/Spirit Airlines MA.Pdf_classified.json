        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following are some questions that you may have about the merger and the special meeting, and brief answers to those questions. We urge you to\nread carefully the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be\nimportant to you with respect to the merger or the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the documents incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement. Please see \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat is the merger?\nA:\nJetBlue and Spirit have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 28, 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cmerger agreement\u201d).\nUnder the merger agreement, Sundown Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue (which we refer\nto as \u201cMerger Sub\u201d), will merge with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of\nJetBlue, in a transaction we refer to as the \u201cmerger.\u201d We entered into the merger agreement following the agreement with Frontier Group Holdings,\nInc. (which we refer to as \u201cFrontier\u201d) on July 27, 2022 to mutually terminate the Agreement and Plan of Merger we entered into with Frontier on\nFebruary 5, 2022. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement as Annex A.\nQ:\nWhat will Spirit stockholders receive pursuant to the merger agreement and in the merger?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Spirit (which we refer to as \u201cSpirit common\nstock\u201d) (except for shares held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and\nwho complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D (which we refer to as\n\u201cdissenting shares\u201d), treasury stock, and shares owned by JetBlue, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries), will be\nconverted into the right to receive an amount in cash per share, without interest, equal to (such amount, the \u201cmerger consideration\u201d) (i) $33.50\nminus (ii) (A) $2.50 (which we refer to as the \u201capproval prepayment amount\u201d), to the extent paid following the adoption by the holders of common\nstock of Spirit (who we refer to as \u201cSpirit stockholders\u201d) of the merger agreement at the special meeting (or, in the event that the closing of the\nmerger (which we refer to as the \u201cclosing\u201d) occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of, such approval prepayment amount, to\nthe extent payable after the closing), and (B) an additional per share prepayment amount calculated as the product of $0.10 (which we refer to as the\n\u201cadditional prepayment amount\u201d) and the number of additional prepayments paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (or, in the\nevent the closing occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of any such additional prepayment, to the extent payable after the\nclosing), not to exceed $1.15 per share, by JetBlue to Spirit stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement after December 31, 2022. If the\nclosing occurs during or later than January 2024, the total cash received by Spirit stockholders, including the approval prepayment amount and the\naggregate additional prepayment amounts, will increase over time up to a maximum of $34.15 per share in the event the transaction is consummated\non the outside date in July 2024.\nRegardless of whether the merger is completed, in the event the Spirit stockholders adopt the merger proposal at the special meeting, JetBlue will\npay or cause to be paid the approval prepayment amount to Spirit stockholders as of the record date established by Spirit for the special meeting\nwithin five business days following such Spirit stockholder approval (which payment, we refer to as the \u201capproval prepayment\u201d). In the event of\nsuch stockholder approval, on or prior to the last business day of each month beginning after December 31, 2022, until the earlier of the closing or\ntermination of the merger agreement, JetBlue will also pay or cause to be paid the additional prepayment amount to Spirit stockholders as of a\nrecord date not more than five business days prior to the last business day of such month (which additional payments, we refer to as the\n\u201cadditional prepayments\u201d). If the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances for failure to obtain U.S. antitrust regulatory clearance,\nJetBlue will be required to pay (i) to Spirit, $70.0 million, and (ii) to the Spirit stockholders, the excess of (A) $400.0 million minus (B) the sum of the\napproval prepayment and all additional prepayments previously paid by JetBlue to the Spirit stockholders.\n1Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nA:\nWe are delivering this document to you because it is a proxy statement being used by the board of directors of Spirit (which we refer to as the\n\u201cSpirit board of directors\u201d) to solicit proxies of Spirit stockholders in connection with approval of the merger and related matters.

converted into, for\neach share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time (treating for this purpose\nany performance-based vesting conditions to which a 2022 Spirit PSU award or Spirit MSU award is subject as having been achieved based on\ntarget performance as of immediately prior to the effective time), the right to receive an amount in cash that is subject to the same service vesting\nschedule applicable to the related Spirit RSU award and is equal to the sum of:\n(x) the merger consideration, plus\n2\nTable of Contents\n(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity\naward plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit RSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity\naward plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid pursuant to the merger

granted in fiscal years 2023 and\n2024 pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and\nconverted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue\nrestricted stock unit denominated in JetBlue common stock (each, a \u201cJetBlue RSU award\u201d) based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms\nand conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately

\u201cJetBlue compensation committee\u201d) in its sole discretion.\nQ:\nHow will the merger affect Spirit performance share awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards)?\nA:\nUnder the merger agreement, each Spirit PSU award granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan (other than a 2022 Spirit PSU award and Spirit\nMSU award) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will entitle the holder to receive, immediately prior to the effective time\nand subject to the occurrence of the closing, the number of shares of Spirit common stock that are earned thereunder based on target performance\nas of immediately prior to the effective time, in each case, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of whole months\nelapsed from the first day of the applicable performance period until the closing and the denominator of which is equal to the total months in the\napplicable performance period. Any shares of Spirit common stock so delivered in respect of a Spirit PSU award will be deemed to be issued and\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and will have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:\n(x) the merger consideration, plus\n(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity\naward plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity\naward plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid pursuant to the merger agreement, the approval prepayment\namount, plus\n(z) solely to the extent the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity\naward plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity\naward plan, in each case, to reflect any additional prepayment, any additional prepayment amount not yet paid to the holder of such Spirit\nPSU award.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that each Spirit PSU award granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 that is outstanding\nas of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the\nrelated Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue RSU award based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms\nand conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time\u037e provided,\nhowever, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as determined by the JetBlue compensation committee in its sole discretion.\n3\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow will the merger affect Spirit warrants?\nA:\nUnder the merger agreement, immediately prior to the effective time, (i) the Spirit warrants will be assumed by JetBlue and will be converted into\nwarrants exercisable for the merger consideration and (ii) JetBlue will assume the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every\ncovenant, agreement and condition of the Spirit warrant agreements, such that the JetBlue assumed warrants will continue to have, and will be\nsubject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Spirit warrants immediately prior to the effective time. The exercise price of the Spirit\nwarrants will be adjusted in accordance with the Spirit warrant agreements to take into account the approval prepayment amount and the additional\nprepayment amount, to the extent paid prior to closing.\nQ:\nHow will the merger affect Spirit convertible notes?\nA:\nUnder the indentures governing Spirit\u2019s 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (which we refer to as the \u201c2025 convertible notes\u201d) and Spirit\u2019s\n1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (which we refer to as the \u201c2026 convertible notes\u201d and, together with the 2025 convertible notes, the\n\u201cSpirit convertible notes\u201d), prior to the effective time, Spirit, JetBlue and the Spirit convertible notes trustee will execute supplemental indentures to,\namong other things, (i) change each Spirit convertible note holder\u2019s right to convert Spirit convertible notes for shares of Spirit common stock into\na right to convert Spirit convertible notes for the aggregate consideration paid per share pursuant to the merger agreement on and after the\neffective date, and (ii) provide for JetBlue\u2019s assumption of Spirit\u2019s obligations under the Spirit convertible notes upon consummation of the merger,\nin each case pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes. At the effective time, (i) the Spirit convertible notes will\nbe temporarily subject to a cash repurchase option at par value plus accrued interest following the merger, (ii) holders of the Spirit convertible notes\nmay convert their notes for thirty-five trading days after the closing of the merger (as such period may be extended pursuant to the terms of the\nindentures governing the Spirit convertible notes), and (iii) the conversion rates of the Spirit convertible notes may be temporarily increased\nfollowing the merger. The approval prepayment amount and the additional prepayment amounts will be payable in accordance with the terms of the\nindentures governing the Spirit convertible notes.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Spirit will settle any conversions of Spirit convertible notes that occur prior to the effective time (i)\npursuant to \u201cPhysical Settlement\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 convertible notes) for any conversions of 2025 convertible notes\nand (ii) pursuant to \u201cCash Settlement\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 convertible notes) for any conversions of 2026 convertible\nnotes, in each case pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes.\nQ:\nWhat are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Spirit stockholders?\nA:\nThe exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local\nand non-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of\nmerger consideration received by the U.S. holder and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock surrendered in\nexchange therefor.\nThe tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders is not clear. The parties have agreed to\nreport the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders as amounts paid by JetBlue to, and for the benefit of, the\nSpirit stockholders for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the approval\nprepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger consideration paid before the closing of the merger (with a corresponding\nadjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder when such U.S. holder sells or exchanges its shares of Spirit common stock)\u037e as gain\nrealized by a U.S. holder in respect of a separate right or obligation with respect to its shares of Spirit common stock (e.g., if\n4\nTable of Contents\nthe merger is not consummated or if a U.S. holder disposes of its shares before the closing of the merger)\u037e or potentially as ordinary income to the\nU.S. holder. It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) could disagree with the above characterization and\nseek to characterize the approval prepayment and/or the additional prepayments in a different manner.\nA non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger unless the non-U.S. holder\nhas certain connections to the United States or Spirit is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. In light of the\nuncertainty as to the tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders, there is a meaningful\npossibility that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds shares of Spirit common stock beneficially owned by a non-U.S. holder may\nwithhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the approval prepayment and the additional\nprepayments.\nFor further information, please see the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 114 of\nthis proxy statement.\nAll holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger, the\napproval prepayment and the additional prepayments to them in light of their particular facts and circumstances.\nQ:\nIf I am a Spirit stockholder, should I send in my Spirit stock certificate(s) now?\nA:\nNo. Please do not send in your Spirit stock certificate(s) with your proxy. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificated\nform, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for how to send your share certificates to the paying agent, in connection with the\nmerger. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conversion of Shares\u037e Exchange of Certificates.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I hold my shares of Spirit common stock in book-entry form?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed and your shares of Spirit common stock are held in book-entry form through the Depositary Trust Company (which we\nrefer to in this proxy statement as \u201cDTC\u201d or in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker or other nominee), the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or\nbrokerage account without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificated form or held\ndirectly in your name in book-entry form other than through DTC, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions for returning such letter of\ntransmittal, and, in the case of holders of share certificates, how to send your share certificates to the paying agent, in connection with the merger.\nThe paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check for your shares after you comply with these instructions.\nQ:\nWhen and where will the special meeting take place?\nA:\nThe special meeting will be held virtually via live webcast on the Internet on October 19, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The special meeting will be\nheld solely via live webcast and there will not be a physical meeting location. Spirit stockholders will be able to attend the special meeting online\nand vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SAVE2022SM2 (which we refer to as the\n\u201cspecial meeting website\u201d).\nQ:\nWhat do l need to do now?\nA:\nAfter you have carefully read this proxy statement and have decided how you wish to vote your shares of Spirit common stock, please vote your\nshares promptly so that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting.\n5\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow do I vote?\nA:\nYou may vote by mail or follow any alternative voting procedure described on the proxy card.

If you do not provide\n6\nTable of Contents\nvoting instructions to your brokerage firm, your shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting will not be voted and will not\nbe treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat is the vote required to approve each proposal at the special meeting?\nA:\nMerger proposal:\n\u2022\nStandard: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding\nshares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.\n\u2022\nEffect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a\nproxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the applicable proposal. If\nyou are a holder of shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and you do not attend the special meeting in\nperson or return a proxy, or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm,\nyour shares will not be voted and will not be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. This will have the effect of a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nCompensation proposal:\n\u2022\nStandard: Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the shares of Spirit common\nstock which are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the compensation proposal.\n\u2022\nEffect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a\nproxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the applicable proposal.

Assuming a quorum is present at the\nspecial meeting, this will have no effect on the compensation proposal.\nAdjournment proposal:\n\u2022\nStandard: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of\nSpirit common stock which are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the adjournment\nproposal.\n\u2022\nEffect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a\nproxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the applicable proposal.

Assuming a quorum is present at the\nspecial meeting, this will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhy is my vote important?\nA:\nIf you do not vote, it will be more difficult for Spirit to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting and to receive the vote necessary to\ncomplete the merger. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power\nof all issued and\n7\nTable of Contents\noutstanding shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Only Spirit stockholders as of the close of business on September 12,\n2022 (which we refer to as the \u201crecord date\u201d) are entitled to vote at the special meeting. The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that\nthe Spirit stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal. In addition, your\nfailure to submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting, or failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote, or abstention will have the same effect\nas a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nQ:\nIf my shares of Spirit common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank or broker, will my bank or broker automatically vote my shares for\nme?\nA:\nNo. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or\nother holder of record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting\ninstructions provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Spirit, or by voting\nover the Internet or by telephone, unless you provide a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d which you must obtain from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Your bank,\nbroker or other nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction form for you to use. A so called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will result if your\nbroker, bank or other nominee returns a proxy but does not provide instruction as to how shares should be voted on a particular matter. Under the\ncurrent rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, brokers, banks or other nominees may use their discretion to vote \u201cuninstructed\u201d\nshares (i.e., shares of record held by banks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not\nprovided instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be \u201croutine,\u201d but not with respect to\n\u201cnon-routine\u201d matters. All of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters under applicable stock\nmarket exchange rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, and therefore it is not expected that there will be any broker\nnon-votes at the special meeting. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Spirit common stock on behalf of their customers\nmay not give a proxy to Spirit to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as\nbrokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote\nwill have (i) the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal, (ii) no effect on the compensation proposal and (iii) no effect on the\nadjournment proposal.\nQ:\nCan I attend the special meeting and vote my shares via the Internet?\nA:\nYes. All Spirit stockholders as of the record date, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers,\nnominees or any other holder of record, are invited to attend (via the Internet) the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend (via the\nInternet) the special meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy over the Internet to ensure your vote is counted. Even if you have submitted a proxy\nbefore the special meeting, holders of record of Spirit common stock may still attend the special meeting and vote via the Internet. In such case,\nyour previously submitted proxy will be disregarded.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote?\nA:\nYes. If you are a holder of record of Spirit common stock as of the record date, you may change your vote at any time before your shares of Spirit\ncommon stock are voted electronically at the special meeting by: (1) submitting another properly completed proxy over the Internet, by telephone or\nby mail with a later date\u037e (2) attending (via the Internet) the special meeting and voting online (simply attending (via the Internet) the special\nmeeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy)\u037e or (3) delivering a written revocation letter to Spirit\u2019s Secretary at 2800 Executive Way, Miramar,\nFlorida, 33025, which written revocation letter must be received by Spirit prior to the special meeting. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d\nthrough a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you should contact your record holder to change your vote.\n8\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nIf you receive more than one set of materials, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. In order to\nvote all the shares you own, you must follow the instructions for voting on each proxy card that you receive by mail or email, which include\ninstructions for voting over the Internet, by telephone or by signing, dating and returning each proxy card.\nQ:\nWill Spirit be required to submit the merger proposal to its stockholders even if the Spirit board of directors has withdrawn, modified, or\nqualified its recommendation?\nA:\nYes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the special meeting, Spirit is required to submit the merger proposal to its stockholders even\nif the Spirit board of directors has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation that Spirit stockholders adopt the merger agreement.\nQ:\nAre Spirit stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?\nA:\nPursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of Spirit common stock who hold their shares through the effective time and do not vote their shares\nin favor of adoption of the merger agreement and who comply fully with and properly demand appraisal for their shares under the applicable\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and do not otherwise withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Delaware law, have the right to seek\nappraisal of the fair value of their shares of Spirit common stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the merger is completed. The\n\u201cfair value\u201d of shares of Spirit common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, less than, or equal to the value\nof the merger consideration that Spirit stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. Spirit\nstockholders also should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration\npayable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, \u201cfair value\u201d under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Holders of Spirit common stock who wish to preserve any appraisal rights they may have, must so advise Spirit by submitting a written\ndemand for appraisal prior to the vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, and must not vote in\nfavor of the merger proposal and otherwise follow fully the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. For further information, see \u201cThe\nMerger\u2014Appraisal Rights in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect to complete the merger?\nA:\nJetBlue and Spirit expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2024. However, neither JetBlue nor Spirit can assure you of if or when the merger\nwill be completed. JetBlue and Spirit must obtain the approval of the merger proposal by the Spirit stockholders at the special meeting, and also\nmust obtain necessary regulatory approvals in addition to satisfying certain other closing conditions. For further information, see \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger is not completed, Spirit stockholders will not receive any consideration for their shares of Spirit common stock in connection with the\nmerger, other than the approval prepayment amount and any additional prepayment amounts paid prior to the merger agreement being terminated\n(assuming the merger proposal is approved). Instead, Spirit will remain an independent, public company and Spirit common stock will continue to\nbe listed and traded on the NYSE. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, a termination fee may be required to be\npaid by Spirit to JetBlue. Further, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, an expense reimbursement amount may be\nrequired to be paid by Spirit to JetBlue. Upon the termination of the merger agreement by JetBlue because\n9\nTable of Contents\nof a material, uncured breach by Spirit of the merger agreement, Spirit will be required to pay JetBlue an amount equal to the sum of the approval\nprepayment and all additional prepayments paid by JetBlue directly to the Spirit stockholders.

Each share of Spirit common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the special meeting on each proposal to be\nconsidered at the special meeting.\nFor further information, see \u201cThe Spirit Special Meeting\u201d beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 114)\nThe exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of merger\nconsideration received by the U.S. holder and (2) the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock surrendered in exchange\ntherefor.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders is not clear. The parties have agreed to\nreport the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders as amounts paid by JetBlue to, and for the benefit of, the\nSpirit stockholders for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the approval\nprepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger consideration paid before the closing of the merger (with a corresponding\nadjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder when such U.S. holder sells or exchanges its shares of Spirit common stock)\u037e as gain\nrealized by a U.S. holder in respect of a separate right or obligation with respect to its shares of Spirit common stock (e.g., if the merger is not\nconsummated or if a U.S. holder disposes of its shares before the closing of the merger)\u037e or potentially as ordinary income to the U.S. holder. It is\nalso possible that the IRS could disagree with the above characterization and seek to characterize the approval prepayment and/or the additional\nprepayments in a different manner.\nA non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject\nto U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger unless the non-U.S. holder has\ncertain connections to the United States or Spirit is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. In light of the\nuncertainty as to the tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders, there is a meaningful\npossibility that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds shares of Spirit common stock beneficially owned by a non-U.S. holder may\nwithhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the approval prepayment and the additional\nprepayments.\nFor further information, please see the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 114 of\nthis proxy statement.\nAll holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger, the\napproval prepayment and the additional prepayments to them in light of their particular facts and circumstances.\nInterests of Spirit\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 64)\nIn considering the recommendation of the Spirit board of directors with respect to the merger, Spirit stockholders should be aware that Spirit\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers have interests in the merger, including financial interests, that may be different from, or in addition to, interests of the\nSpirit stockholders generally. The Spirit board of directors was aware of and considered these interests during its deliberations of the merits of the\nmerger and in determining to recommend to Spirit stockholders that they vote for the merger proposal and thereby approve the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger (to the extent such interests existed at that time).\nThese interests potentially include, among others:\n\u2022\nAs holders of Spirit PSU awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards), Spirit\u2019s executive officers will be entitled to prorated vesting and\nsettlement of such awards\u037e\n\u2022\nCash severance payments and/or other benefits under the Spirit executive severance plan (as defined below) that may be payable to\nSpirit\u2019s executive officers upon a qualifying termination in connection with the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nRetention bonuses in connection with the merger in order to retain and incentivize key employees during the period between the public\nannouncement of the merger and the closing of the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nContinued indemnification and insurance coverage to the officers and directors of Spirit following the merger for acts or omissions\noccurring prior to the merger.\n18\nTable of Contents\nFor a more complete description of these interests, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Spirit\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger,\u201d beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.\nAppraisal Rights in the Merger (page 77)\nIf the merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Spirit stockholders who continuously hold shares of Spirit common stock through the\neffective time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and\nexercise, and do not effectively withdraw, fail to perfect or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to\nseek an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Spirit common stock (exclusive of any elements of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive, in lieu of the merger consideration, such fair value, together with\ninterest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any. The amount determined to be fair value by the court will be determined as of the\neffective time and could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration for Spirit common stock. Voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d or failing to\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the\nDGCL.\nDue to the complexity of the appraisal process, Spirit stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares or who wish to preserve their rights to\ndo so should review Annex D carefully and are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights since\nfailure to timely and fully comply with the procedures set forth therein will result in the loss of such rights.\nTo exercise appraisal rights, Spirit stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Spirit before the stockholder vote is taken on the\nmerger proposal at the special meeting\u037e (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e (iii) continue to hold shares of Spirit\ncommon stock of record through the effective time\u037e and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section\n262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In\naddition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Spirit unless certain stock ownership conditions are\nsatisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy\nstatement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of\nSection 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Spirit common stock through a bank, broker or\nother nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate\nprocedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.\nFor more information, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights in the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 82)\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement, both JetBlue and Spirit have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory\napprovals necessary or advisable to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approvals from,\namong others, the U.S. Department of Justice (which we refer to as the \u201cDOJ\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d), the\nU.S. Department of Transportation (which we refer to as the \u201cDOT\u201d), the Federal Aviation Administration (which we refer to as the \u201cFAA\u201d) and the\nFederal Communications Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFCC\u201d). JetBlue and Spirit plan to file applications and notifications to obtain the\nrequired regulatory approvals.\nAlthough neither JetBlue nor Spirit knows of any reason why it cannot obtain these regulatory approvals in a timely manner, JetBlue and Spirit\ncannot be certain when or if they will be obtained.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Spirit board of directors and senior management regularly review and assess Spirit\u2019s financial performance, prospects, competitive position and long-\nterm strategic plan with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of this ongoing process, the Spirit board of directors and senior management\nhave periodically evaluated potential strategic alternatives relating to Spirit and its business and have engaged in discussions with third parties\nconcerning potential strategic transactions, including possible acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations and mergers.\nOn February 5, 2022, the Spirit board of directors unanimously approved and declared advisable the Frontier merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby and resolved to recommend that Spirit stockholders vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement at a special\nmeeting of Spirit stockholders (the \u201cSpirit-Frontier transaction special meeting\u201d). During the same meeting, the compensation committee of the Spirit\nboard of directors (the \u201cSpirit compensation committee\u201d) unanimously approved the retention bonus program for certain key employees of Spirit in\nconnection with the Frontier merger agreement. Later on February 5, 2022, Spirit and Frontier executed the finalized merger agreement.\nOn March 29, 2022, Spirit received an unsolicited proposal from JetBlue to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Spirit common stock at a price of $33.00\nper share (the \u201cJetBlue proposal\u201d), which proposal was subsequently provided to Frontier in accordance with the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.\n33Table of Contents\nOn April 7, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Spirit\u2019s legal\nadvisor, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (\u201cDebevoise\u201d), and Spirit\u2019s antitrust counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), present,\nheld a video conference to review the JetBlue proposal. At that meeting, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, the Spirit\nboard of directors determined that the JetBlue proposal could reasonably be likely to lead to a \u201cSuperior Proposal,\u201d as defined in the Frontier merger\nagreement.\nThe Spirit board of directors directed Spirit\u2019s senior management and its representatives to negotiate a non-disclosure agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d) with JetBlue\nand to engage in discussions with, and provide non-public information to, JetBlue with respect to JetBlue\u2019s proposal, in accordance with the terms of the\nFrontier merger agreement. Spirit and JetBlue entered into an NDA on April 8, 2022 and commenced discussions regarding the JetBlue proposal on April\n9, 2022.\nBetween April 9, 2022 and April 20, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss conducted seven conference calls and video conferences with representatives of\nJetBlue\u2019s legal advisor, Shearman & Sterling LLP (\u201cShearman\u201d), and engaged with economic consultants and economists in order to assess the regulatory\nrisk of an acquisition of Spirit by JetBlue and to assess the validity and merits of JetBlue\u2019s own analysis.\nOn April 15, 2022, Spirit provided JetBlue and its representatives with access to a virtual data room containing due diligence materials for Spirit.\nOn April 19, 2022, members of senior management of Spirit and JetBlue, together with their respective financial advisors, held a video conference to\ndiscuss a broad range of financial and business due diligence matters.\nOn April 21, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the JetBlue proposal. The discussion focused primarily on Spirit\u2019s regulatory concerns with\nthe transaction and the risks to Spirit\u2019s business during the regulatory approval period. The Spirit board of directors directed Spirit\u2019s senior management\nand legal advisors to develop a proposal to convey to JetBlue in respect of the contractual protections that Spirit would need to address the regulatory\nconcerns identified by Spirit.\nOn April 24, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to further discuss the JetBlue proposal. At that meeting, the Spirit board of directors instructed Spirit\u2019s\nsenior management to communicate to JetBlue a package of contractual protections that the Spirit board of directors considered appropriate to provide\nincreased assurance as to the likelihood of regulatory approval of the JetBlue proposal and to protect Spirit and its stockholders against the risk that\nsuch approval would not be obtained, which included a covenant to take all actions necessary to obtain regulatory approval, including being willing to\nterminate JetBlue\u2019s Northeast Alliance Agreement (the \u201cNEA\u201d) with American Airlines and make any divestitures necessary to obtain regulatory\napproval, and a significant reverse termination fee payable in the event that such regulatory approval ultimately was not obtained. The Spirit board of\ndirectors also instructed Spirit\u2019s senior management to inform JetBlue that, in the event that Spirit ultimately concluded that the JetBlue proposal, as it\nmight be amended, constituted a \u201cSuperior Proposal\u201d as defined in the Frontier merger agreement, Spirit would expect JetBlue to fund the termination fee\npayable to Frontier upon termination of the Frontier merger agreement.\nOn April 25, 2022, Mr. Christie called Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, to convey the foregoing package of contractual protections.\nFollowing that discussion, at the direction of Spirit, representatives from Barclays and Morgan Stanley held a call with representatives of JetBlue\u2019s\nfinancial advisor, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (\u201cGoldman\u201d), to discuss the same proposal, and representatives of Debevoise delivered to representatives of\nShearman a document setting forth Spirit\u2019s proposal along with proposed language for the regulatory covenant that Spirit would expect to be included in\nany definitive merger agreement with JetBlue.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOn April 29, 2022, JetBlue sent Spirit a letter setting forth its response to Spirit\u2019s proposed package of contractual protections to address the regulatory\nconcerns identified by Spirit, along with a draft of the merger agreement. In that response, JetBlue offered (i) to pay a reverse termination fee of $200\nmillion if U.S. antitrust approval was not obtained, (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory approvals subject to various\nlimitations, including that JetBlue would not be required to take any action that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the\nanticipated benefits of JetBlue or American Airlines under the NEA or that would have a material adverse effect on Spirit or JetBlue when measured\nrelative to a company of Spirit\u2019s size, and (iii) to fund the termination fee payable to Frontier upon termination of the Frontier merger agreement.\nOn April 30, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the JetBlue proposal, as modified by its April 29, 2022 letter. The Spirit board of directors\u2019\ndiscussion focused on the prospects that JetBlue would be able to obtain regulatory approval for its acquisition of Spirit, particularly in light of the\nongoing litigation regarding the NEA and the requirement of the Frontier merger agreement that, in order for Spirit to change its recommendation to\nstockholders or to terminate such agreement to enter into a merger agreement with JetBlue, the JetBlue proposal must be \u201creasonably capable of being\nconsummated in accordance with the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such\nAcquisition Proposal.\u201d The Spirit board of directors also discussed the extended time that would be required to reach a final regulatory determination,\nexpected to be up to two years, and the risks to Spirit if it were unable to complete the proposed transaction with JetBlue at the end of that period.\nFollowing adjournment, the Spirit board of directors continued its meeting on May 1, 2022. The directors, other than Mr. Christie, initially met in executive\nsession together with representatives of Debevoise, after which Mr. Christie, other members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, and representatives of\nBarclays, Morgan Stanley and Paul Weiss joined the meeting. Following further discussion with its advisors, the Spirit board of directors unanimously\ndetermined that the JetBlue proposal did not constitute a \u201cSuperior Proposal\u201d as defined in the Frontier merger agreement due to the regulatory concerns.\nThe Spirit board of directors did not form a view as to whether the economic terms of the JetBlue proposal were more favorable to the Spirit stockholders,\nfrom a financial point of view, than the economic terms of the Frontier merger agreement.\nThe following morning, on May 2, 2022, Spirit sent a letter to JetBlue, which Spirit also released publicly, informing JetBlue that the Spirit board of\ndirectors had determined that the JetBlue proposal did not constitute a \u201cSuperior Proposal\u201d as defined in the Frontier merger agreement, on the grounds\nthat it did not adequately address regulatory concerns raised by a proposed combination with JetBlue, and stating that the Spirit board of directors\ncontinued to believe that the pending transaction with Frontier represented the best opportunity to maximize value for the Spirit stockholders.\nOn May 16, 2022, JetBlue issued a press release announcing that it was commencing an unsolicited offer (the \u201cOffer\u201d), through its direct wholly owned\nsubsidiary Sundown Acquisition Corp., to purchase any and all of the issued and outstanding shares of Spirit common stock for $30.00 per share in cash,\nwithout interest and less any required withholding taxes (the \u201cOffer Price\u201d), which was $3.00 less than the earlier JetBlue proposal. Shortly thereafter,\nJetBlue filed with the SEC the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the \u201cSchedule TO\u201d) containing the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal and\nrelated documents. The Schedule TO provided that if a consensual transaction were reached with the Spirit board of directors and satisfactory diligence\ninformation was provided to support the price increase, JetBlue would consider increasing the Offer Price to $33.00 per share.\nAlso on May 16, 2022, JetBlue filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC to be used to solicit proxies in opposition to the\nproposed merger with Frontier and other related proposals at the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting.\nDuring the evening of May 16, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Debevoise present,\nheld a video conference to discuss the Offer. Spirit also issued a press\n35\nTable of Contents\nrelease that evening noting that the Spirit board of directors would review the Offer and intended to advise Spirit stockholders of its formal position\nregarding the Offer within 10 business days by making available to Spirit stockholders and filing with the SEC a solicitation/recommendation statement on\nSchedule 14D-9, and advised its stockholders to take no action at the time in response to the Offer.\nAlso on May 16, 2022, Spirit delivered a notice to JetBlue to return or destroy all confidential materials or information exchanged between the parties\npursuant to the NDA. In addition, Spirit revoked JetBlue\u2019s and its advisors\u2019 access to Spirit\u2019s virtual data room. On May 26, 2022, JetBlue confirmed in\nwriting to Spirit that JetBlue had returned or destroyed all confidential materials or information received by JetBlue pursuant to the NDA.\nOn May 18, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the Offer. Following discussion among the Spirit board of directors and its advisors, the Spirit\nboard of directors unanimously recommended that the Spirit stockholders reject the Offer and not tender their shares of Spirit common stock pursuant to\nthe Offer.\nOn May 19, 2022, Spirit filed with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and issued a press release announcing that the\nSpirit board of directors had unanimously determined to reject the Offer.\nOn June 1, 2022, Institutional Shareholder Services (\u201cISS\u201d), a proxy advisory firm, published a report recommending that Spirit stockholders vote against\nthe adoption of the Frontier merger agreement, in large part on the basis that the Frontier merger agreement did not provide for Frontier to pay Spirit a\n\u201creverse termination fee\u201d in the event that the transaction did not receive antitrust approval. ISS contrasted that with JetBlue\u2019s offer to pay a $200 million\nreverse termination fee to Spirit if JetBlue\u2019s proposed transaction was accepted by Spirit but could not be consummated as a result of the failure to obtain\nantitrust approval.\nLater on June 1, 2022, Mr. Christie spoke with William (\u201cBill\u201d) A. Franke, chairman of the board of directors of Frontier, by telephone regarding the ISS\nreport and potential changes to the Frontier merger agreement to address the concerns raised by ISS, including the addition of a reverse termination fee\nand potential changes to the merger consideration provided for in the Frontier merger agreement. Later on June 1, 2022, representatives of Debevoise sent\nto representatives of Frontier\u2019s legal advisor, Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham & Watkins\u201d), a proposed draft of an amendment to the Frontier merger\nagreement.\nOn June 2, 2022, Mr. Franke and Mr. Christie, respectively joined by other members of Frontier and Spirit management, spoke by telephone. On that call,\nMr. Franke informed Mr. Christie that the Frontier board of directors had met that morning and had authorized an amendment of the Frontier merger\nagreement to provide for the payment by Frontier to Spirit of a reverse termination fee in the amount of $250 million if the transaction could not be\nconsummated as a result of the failure to obtain antitrust approval, but that the Frontier board of directors had not authorized any change to the merger\nconsideration. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Latham & Watkins sent to representatives of Debevoise a revised draft of the amendment to the\nFrontier merger agreement that included the $250 million reverse termination fee.\nLater on June 2, 2022, the Spirit board of directors met to consider the changes to the Frontier merger agreement proposed by Frontier, including the $250\nmillion reverse termination fee. After discussion, the Spirit board of directors unanimously approved the proposed amendment to the Frontier merger\nagreement.\nLater on June 2, 2022, Spirit and Frontier finalized the amendment to the Frontier merger agreement and the parties executed the amendment.\nOn June 6, 2022, JetBlue sent the Spirit board of directors an updated proposal to acquire all of the shares of Spirit common stock containing the\nfollowing terms (i) an aggregate reverse break-up fee of $350 million payable in the event the requisite antitrust approvals are not obtained, (ii) a\nprepayment of a portion of the\n36\nTable of Contents\nreverse termination fee in the amount of $1.50 per share in cash, payable to Spirit stockholders as a cash dividend, which would be funded by JetBlue and\nwould be payable promptly following the later of the approval by the Spirit stockholders of a negotiated transaction with JetBlue and the termination of\nthe restrictions on the payment of dividends by Spirit imposed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), which\ndividend would reduce the reverse termination fee payable by JetBlue to Spirit upon termination of the transaction in the event the requisite antitrust\napprovals are not obtained, and (iii) in a negotiated transaction, total aggregate consideration of $31.50 per share in cash to the Spirit stockholders,\ncomprised of the prepayment dividend of $1.50 per share and $30.00 per share in cash payable upon consummation of JetBlue\u2019s acquisition of Spirit.\nJetBlue issued a press release and filed an amendment to the Schedule TO regarding JetBlue\u2019s updated proposal. The amendment to the Schedule TO\nprovided that if a consensual transaction were reached with the Spirit board of directors and satisfactory diligence information was provided to support\nthe price increase, JetBlue would be willing to enter into a consensual transaction with Spirit on the terms described above.\nLater on June 6, 2022, Mr. Christie spoke with Mr. Franke by telephone regarding the JetBlue\u2019s June 6 proposal and potential changes to the Frontier\nmerger agreement that might be made in response to JetBlue\u2019s updated proposal, including in particular an increase to the reverse termination fee.\nLater on June 6, 2022, representatives of Citi spoke by telephone with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley.

In the course of these calls and comments, on or around July 5, 2022, representatives of\nDebevoise and Shearman agreed that it would be feasible for JetBlue to make direct payments to Spirit stockholders (or their brokers) of the prepayment\namounts referred to in JetBlue\u2019s revised proposal. JetBlue then proposed, through representatives of Shearman, that any definitive merger agreement\nbetween JetBlue and Spirit provide for the direct prepayments by JetBlue to Spirit stockholders.\nOn July 5, 2022, Mr. H. McIntyre Gardner, chairman of the Spirit board of directors, Mr. Peter Boneparth, chairman of the JetBlue board of directors and\nMessrs. Christie and Hayes met in person in New York City to discuss certain aspects of JetBlue\u2019s revised proposal and the strategic rationale for a\ntransaction, as well as JetBlue\u2019s strategy to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction.\nOn July 6, 2022, representatives of Spirit, Paul Weiss, JetBlue and Shearman met via videoconference and discussed aspects of the NEA.\nAlso on July 6, 2022, Mr. Christie and Mr. Bill Franke discussed by telephone the upcoming vote of Spirit stockholders and the competing proposals from\nFrontier and from JetBlue. Mr. Franke informed Mr. Christie that Frontier did not intend to change the economic terms of the Frontier merger agreement in\nresponse to the JetBlue\u2019s revised proposal and acknowledged the low likelihood that the Frontier merger agreement would be approved by Spirit\nstockholders.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, met via teleconference and approved the further\n41\nTable of Contents\nadjournment of the special meeting of Spirit stockholders until July 15, 2022, in order to continue discussions with Frontier and JetBlue and to continue to\nsolicit proxies from Spirit stockholders. Later on July 7, 2022, Spirit announced that it would adjourn the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting until\nJuly 15, 2022.\nLater on July 7, 2022, representatives of Debevoise spoke by telephone with representatives of Latham & Watkins and discussed the possibility of a\nconsensual termination of the Frontier merger agreement if it appeared that the requisite approval of Spirit stockholders would not be obtained, with such\ntermination having the same effect as if the Frontier merger agreement were to be terminated following the failure of the Spirit stockholders to approve the\nmerger agreement. Representatives of Latham & Watkins subsequently discussed that proposal with representatives of Frontier and informed\nrepresentatives of Debevoise that Frontier was not willing to terminate the Frontier merger agreement on the terms proposed by Debevoise.\nOn July 8, 2022, the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting was further adjourned until July 15, 2022.\nBetween July 7, 2022 and July 12, 2022, Messrs.

During\nthis time, representatives of Debevoise and Shearman also continued to discuss and exchange comments by email to the interim operating covenants, the\nproposed retention bonus program for certain key Spirit employees, and the regulatory covenant of the draft merger agreement.\nOn July 10, 2022, Frontier sent Spirit a letter that was also issued as a press release and that, among other things, requested that Spirit further adjourn the\nSpirit-Frontier transaction special meeting until July 27, 2022, requested that the Spirit board of directors reaffirm its recommendation for the Frontier\nmerger agreement, and stated that Frontier did not intend to propose any further modifications to the financial terms of the Frontier merger agreement and\nthat Spirit should consider the terms set forth in the amendment to the Frontier merger agreement entered into on June 24, 2022, as representing Frontier\u2019s\nbest and final offer.\nOn July 12, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise\nand Paul Weiss present, met via teleconference to discuss Frontier\u2019s July 10, 2022, letter. At that meeting, the Spirit board of directors determined to\nreaffirm its recommendation in favor of the Frontier merger agreement and to further adjourn the special meeting of Spirit stockholders until July 27, 2022.\nOn the morning of July 13, 2022, Spirit issued a press release announcing the reaffirmation by the Spirit board of directors of its recommendation that the\nSpirit stockholders approve the Frontier merger agreement and that Spirit intended to further adjourn the special meeting of Spirit stockholders until July\n27, 2022.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting was further adjourned until July 27, 2022.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOn July 18, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent to representatives of Debevoise a revised draft of JetBlue\u2019s disclosure schedules to the draft merger\nagreement, which was subsequently provided to Frontier in accordance with the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.\nOn July 20, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent to representatives of Debevoise a revised commitment letter received by JetBlue from its debt\nfinancing sources.\nOn July 21, 2022, representatives of Debevoise sent to representatives of Shearman a revised draft of the merger agreement, which was subsequently\nprovided to Frontier in accordance with the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.\nBetween July 22, 2022, and July 26, 2022, representatives of Debevoise and Shearman continued to discuss the provisions of the draft merger agreement,\nfocusing on the allocation of tax risk relating to the proposed direct payments to Spirit stockholders, the interim operating covenants, the regulatory\nefforts covenant, and the retention bonus program for certain key Spirit employees.\nOn July 24, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent to representatives of Debevoise comments on Spirit\u2019s disclosure schedules to the draft merger\nagreement, which was subsequently provided to Frontier in accordance with the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.\nOn July 25, 2022, representatives of Debevoise and Latham & Watkins had a call during which they discussed the possibility of a consensual termination\nof the Frontier merger agreement in the event there were not sufficient votes in favor of the Frontier merger agreement prior to the start of the special\nmeeting scheduled for July 27, 2022. Following that call, representatives of Debevoise sent a draft of a termination agreement to Latham & Watkins.\nLater on July 25, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley and\nDebevoise present, met via videoconference to discuss the status of the proxy solicitation in respect of the upcoming special meeting of Spirit\nstockholders, the potential termination of the Frontier merger agreement in the event that the vote of Spirit stockholders to approve the Frontier merger\nagreement was not obtained, and the status of the negotiations with JetBlue regarding its proposal. At that meeting, representatives of Barclays and\nMorgan Stanley provided their preliminary financial analyses of the terms of the JetBlue proposal. The Spirit board of directors authorized Spirit\nmanagement to terminate the Frontier merger agreement if the approval of the Spirit stockholders was not obtained.\nLater on July 25, 2022, representatives of Debevoise and Shearman held a call to discuss the remaining open issues on the draft merger agreement.\nOn July 26, 2022, representatives of Shearman sent representatives of Debevoise a revised draft of the merger agreement.\nLater on July 26, 2022, representatives of Debevoise held a call with representatives of Latham & Watkins during which representatives of Latham &\nWatkins informed representatives of Debevoise that Frontier agreed to the form of termination agreement and wished to terminate the Frontier merger\nagreement on the afternoon of July 27, 2022 and to announce the termination immediately following the close of trading on that day.\nDuring the morning of July 27, 2022, JetBlue sent to Spirit a letter offering to enter into the proposed merger agreement, in the form attached to that letter,\nwhich provided that such offer was irrevocable until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, July 29, 2022.\nAt 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on July 27, 2022, Spirit commenced the special meeting of Spirit stockholders. After introducing the resolutions to be voted on\nat the meeting, Spirit announced that the voting would remain open until 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time, and that the meeting would be recessed until 4:00 p.m.\nEastern Time.\n43\nTable of Contents\nLater on July 27, 2022, Spirit and Frontier entered into the agreement terminating the Frontier merger agreement.\nAt 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on July 27, 2022, Spirit re-opened the special meeting of Spirit stockholders and announced that the Frontier merger agreement\nhad been terminated and that, accordingly, the voting would not proceed.\nLater on July 27, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit\u2019s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley and\nDebevoise present, met via videoconference to review and consider whether to approve the proposed transaction with JetBlue. After referencing its\nfinancial analyses provided to the Spirit board of directors in advance of the meeting (i) Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently\nconfirmed in writing) to the Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations, and assumptions\nstated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than the holders of the excluded\nshares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of shares of Spirit common stock, and (ii) Morgan\nStanley rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and\nsubject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review\nundertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common\nstock (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of\nSpirit common stock. The Spirit board of directors unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby and resolved to recommend that Spirit stockholders vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.\nDuring the same meeting on July 27, 2022, the Spirit compensation committee unanimously approved a key employee retention bonus program pursuant\nto which certain key employees of Spirit, including its executive officers, are eligible to receive a cash-based and, under certain circumstances, equity-\nbased retention award. For participants who are executive officers of Spirit, the retention award amounts generally range from 100% of a participant\u2019s total\ncash compensation (for Vice Presidents) to 150% of a participant\u2019s total cash compensation (for Senior Vice Presidents and above). The cash-based\nretention awards are generally payable in two installments: (i) 25% of a retention award will be paid on July 28, 2023 (or, if sooner, at the closing of the\nmerger), and (ii) the remaining 75% of a retention award will be paid within 30 days following the closing of the merger, in each case, subject to a\nparticipant\u2019s continued employment through the applicable payment date and, for executive officers, no sooner than April 2, 2023. If an executive officer\u2019s\nretention award exceeds 100% of the executive officer\u2019s total cash compensation, then such excess amount will instead be payable in the form of\nrestricted stock units of Spirit that will vest in three equal annual installments (measured from the scheduled payment date of the cash-based portion of\nthe retention award), and be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing of the merger on the same terms and conditions. Further, Spirit may provide an\nadditional retention award to any participant, subject, where applicable, to approval of the Spirit compensation committee and JetBlue, the value of which\nwould be based on retention awards granted to similarly situated employees and the proportion of the expected retention period that has transpired. Any\nsuch additional retention awards would be payable in accordance with the payment schedule described above, but no earlier than twelve months\nfollowing the date of grant, subject to continued employment through such payment date, and would be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing of the\nmerger. Participants would be entitled to 50% of their respective retention awards in the event the merger is not consummated, to be paid on the 30th day\nfollowing the termination of the merger agreement (or on April 2, 2023, if later).\nLater on July 27, 2022, representatives of Debevoise and Shearman agreed to certain final revisions to Spirit\u2019s disclosure schedules to the merger\nagreement, and representatives of Paul Weiss and Shearman held a videoconference to discuss certain regulatory aspects of the merger.\nEarly on the morning of July 28, 2022, Spirit and JetBlue executed the merger agreement.\n44\nTable of Contents\nLater on July 28, 2022, Spirit and JetBlue issued a joint press release announcing the signing of the merger agreement and made a joint press appearance.\nJetBlue then filed a final amendment to the previously filed Schedule TO for the Offer, announcing the termination of the Offer.",

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.\nSpirit engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives for Spirit, including a possible sale of Spirit, pursuant\nto an engagement letter dated November 21, 2019. On July 27, 2022, Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to\nthe Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the\nconsideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.\nThe full text of Barclays\u2019 written opinion, dated as of July 27, 2022, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Barclays\u2019 written opinion sets forth,\namong other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in\nrendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays\u2019 opinion and the\nmethodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.\nBarclays\u2019 opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays\u2019 Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Spirit board of directors, addresses\nonly the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the proposed transaction and does not\nconstitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Spirit as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed transaction or any other\nmatter. The terms of the proposed transaction were determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Spirit and JetBlue and were unanimously\napproved by the Spirit board of directors. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to Spirit or that any specific form of\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed transaction. Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does\nnot in any manner address, Spirit\u2019s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed transaction, the likelihood of the consummation\nof the proposed transaction, or the relative merits of the proposed transaction as compared to any other transaction in which Spirit may engage, including\nthe transaction set forth in the Frontier merger agreement (which we refer to as the \u201cprior transaction\u201d), which transaction Spirit advised Barclays had\nbeen terminated. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature\nof any compensation to any officers, directors or\n50Table of Contents\nemployees of any parties to the proposed transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the stockholders of\nSpirit in the proposed transaction or otherwise. No limitations were imposed by the Spirit board of directors upon Barclays with respect to the\ninvestigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed a draft of the merger agreement, dated as of July 26, 2022, and the specific terms of the proposed transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning Spirit and JetBlue that Barclays believed to be relevant to Barclays\u2019\nanalysis, including Spirit\u2019s and JetBlue\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and Spirit\u2019s and\nJetBlue\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Spirit furnished to\nBarclays by Spirit, including the Spirit Financial Forecasts\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed a trading history of Spirit common stock from July 26, 2017 to July 26, 2022, and a comparison of that trading history\nwith those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price\ntargets of Spirit\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of Spirit with those of other\ncompanies that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\n\u2022\nhad discussions with Spirit management concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects\u037e and\n\u2022\nhas undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Barclays\nwithout any independent verification of such information (and had not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such\ninformation). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of Spirit management that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such\ninformation inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Spirit Financial Forecasts, upon the advice of Spirit, Barclays assumed that such projections\nwere reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Spirit management as to the future financial\nperformance of Spirit and that Spirit would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. Barclays assumed no responsibility for and\nexpressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not\nconduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of Spirit and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities\nof Spirit. Barclays\u2019 opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, July 27,\n2022. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may occur after July 27, 2022.\nBarclays assumed that the executed merger agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by Barclays. In addition, Barclays\nassumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all agreements related thereto. Barclays also\nassumed, upon the advice of Spirit, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed\ntransaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the merger agreement and that the proposed transaction will be consummated in\naccordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof.\nBarclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the proposed transaction, nor did Barclays\u2019 opinion\naddress any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood Spirit had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from\nqualified professionals.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. In arriving at its\nopinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of Spirit common stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the proposed transaction on the basis of various financial and\ncomparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and\nrelevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness\nopinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but rather made qualitative\njudgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in\nthe context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as\nconsidering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete\nview of the process underlying its opinion.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the Spirit board of directors. The summary of\nBarclays\u2019 analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Barclays\u2019 opinion. The preparation\nof a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and\nthe application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.\nFor the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,\nmarket and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Spirit, Barclays or any other parties to the proposed\ntransaction. No company, business or transaction considered in Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews is identical to Spirit or the proposed transaction, and an\nevaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and\njudgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the\ncompanies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews. None of Spirit, Barclays or any other person assumes responsibility\nif future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations\nresulting from any particular analysis or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not\npurport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the companies, businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in,\nand the results derived from, Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe summary of the financial analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of the\nanalyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view\nof Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews.\nSelected Comparable Company Analysis\nIn order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of relative implied equity values per\nshare of Spirit by reference to those companies, which could then be\n52\nTable of Contents\nused to calculate implied ranges, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to Spirit with selected companies that\nBarclays, based on its experience in the airline industry, deemed comparable to Spirit. The selected comparable companies with respect to Spirit were:\n\u2022\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n\u2022\nAllegiant Travel Company\n\u2022\nSun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nJetBlue Airways Corporation\n\u2022\nFrontier Group Holdings, Inc.\nBarclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of Spirit and the selected comparable companies. As part of its selected\ncomparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed each company\u2019s ratio of its current stock price to its projected earnings per share\n(commonly referred to as a price earnings ratio, or P/E), and each company\u2019s adjusted enterprise value to certain projected financial criteria (such as\nrevenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent, or EBITDAR). The adjusted enterprise value of each company was\nobtained by adding its short and long-term debt and operating leases to the sum of the market value of its common equity, the value of any preferred\nstock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority interest, and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents. All of these calculations were\nperformed, and based on publicly available financial data and closing prices, as of July 26, 2022, for the selected comparable companies, the last trading\ndate prior to the delivery of Barclays\u2019 opinion, and as of February 4, 2022, for Spirit, the last trading date prior to news reports of the prior transaction\n(which we refer to as the \u201cunaffected date\u201d). The results of this selected comparable company analysis are summarized below:\nAdj.

These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels\nand degree of operational risk between Spirit and the companies included in the selected company analysis. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\non the air transportation services industry, Barclays focused its analysis of the selected financial metrics to 2023E.\nBased upon the analysis described above and its professional judgment, Barclays selected a range of 2023 estimated P/E multiples of 8.0x to 10.0x for\nSpirit and applied such range to Spirit\u2019s adjusted EPS, as set out in the Spirit Financial Forecasts, to calculate a range of implied prices per share of Spirit\ncommon stock of $16 to $20. Based upon its professional judgment, Barclays also selected a range of 2023 estimated EBITDAR multiples\n53\nTable of Contents\nof 4.0x to 5.0x for Spirit and applied such range to Spirit\u2019s EBITDAR, as set out in the Spirit Financial Forecasts, to calculate a range of implied prices per\nshare of Spirit common stock of $7 to $17. Barclays noted that, on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the consideration to be\nreceived by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger was above the 2023 estimated P/E range and above the 2023 estimated EBITDAR range.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nIn order to estimate the present value of Spirit common stock, Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Spirit. A discounted cash flow\nanalysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of\nthe asset. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts\nby a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other\nappropriate factors.\nTo calculate the estimated enterprise value of Spirit using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays (i) added Spirit\u2019s projected after-tax unlevered free\ncash flows for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 through the end of fiscal year 2026 based on the Spirit Financial Forecasts to the \u201cterminal value\u201d of\nSpirit as of December 31, 2026, and then (ii) discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered\nfree cash flows were calculated by taking the projected total EBITDAR, adjusted for one-time or non-recurring items, and subtracting rent expenses,\nunlevered cash taxes and capital expenditures and adjusting for the impact of depreciation and amortization, changes in working capital (including\nchanges in deferred heavy maintenance) and certain other non-cash expenses. The residual value of Spirit at the end of the forecast period, or \u201cterminal\nvalue,\u201d was estimated by selecting a range of terminal value multiples based on estimated last twelve months EBITDAR (which we refer to as \u201cLTM\nEBITDAR\u201d) for the period from April 1, 2022, to December 31, 2026, of 5.5x to 7.5x, which was derived by analyzing historical average LTM EBITDAR\nmultiples from selected comparable companies and applying such range to Spirit\u2019s 2026 estimated LTM EBITDAR, as set out in the Spirit Financial\nForecasts. The range of after-tax discount rates of 10.5% to 12.5% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Spirit and\nthe comparable companies. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Spirit by (A) (i) subtracting estimated total debt of $3.2 billion\nand (ii) adding cash of $1.4 billion, each as of March 31, 2022, from the estimated enterprise value using the discounted cash flow method and (B) dividing\nsuch amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Spirit common stock. These calculations resulted in a range of implied price per share of $26 to $55\n(which we refer to as the \u201cSpirit DCF range\u201d). Barclays noted that the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger was within\nthe Spirit DCF range.\nOther Factors\nBarclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but\nwere references for informational purposes, including, among other things, the information described below under \u201c\u2014Historical Share Price Analysis\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Research Analyst Price Targets.\u201d\nHistorical Share Price Analysis\nTo illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of Spirit common stock, Barclays considered historical data with regard to the trading prices of Spirit\ncommon stock for the period from July 26, 2021 to July 26, 2022, and compared such data with the relative stock price performances during the same\nperiods of the S&P 500, the U.S. Global Jets ETF and the selected companies described above under \u201c\u2014Summary of Material Financial Analyses\n\u2014Selected Comparable Company Analysis.\u201d Barclays noted that the closing price of Spirit common stock ranged from $16 to $29 during the 52-week\nperiod ended July 26, 2022.\n54\nTable of Contents\nResearch Analyst Price Targets\nBarclays reviewed, for informational purposes, as of July 26, 2022, the publicly available standalone price targets of Spirit common stock published by\nequity research analysts associated with various Wall Street bulge-bracket and middle market brokers. The research analysts\u2019 price target per share of\nSpirit common stock ranged from $24 to $36 per share. The publicly available share price targets published by such equity research analysts do not\nnecessarily reflect the current market trading price for Spirit common stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial\nperformance of Spirit and future market conditions. Research analyst price targets for Spirit were used for informational purposes only and were not\nincluded in Barclays\u2019 financial analyses.\nGeneral\nBarclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,\ncompetitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.\nThe Spirit board of directors selected Barclays because of its familiarity with Spirit and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of\nbusinesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the\nproposed transaction.\nBarclays is acting as financial advisor to Spirit in connection with the proposed transaction. As compensation for its services in connection with the\nproposed transaction, Spirit paid Barclays a fee of $3 million upon the delivery of Barclays\u2019 opinion and a fee of $3 million upon the delivery of Barclays\u2019\nopinion in connection with the prior transaction (together, referred to as the \u201copinion fees\u201d). The opinion fees were not contingent upon the conclusion\nof Barclays\u2019 opinion or the consummation of the proposed transaction or the prior transaction. Additional compensation of $14 million will be payable on\ncompletion of the proposed transaction against which the opinion fees will be credited. In addition, Spirit has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion\nof its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may\narise out of its engagement by Spirit and the rendering of Barclays\u2019 opinion. Barclays has performed various investment banking services for Spirit and\nJetBlue in the past, and may perform such services in the future, and has received, and would expect to receive, customary fees for such services.\nSpecifically, in the past two years, Barclays has performed the following investment banking and financial services: (a) for Spirit (i) having acted as a\nfinancial advisor to Spirit in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020\u037e (ii) having acted as a structuring agent and\njoint bookrunner on Spirit\u2019s $850 million senior secured notes in September 2020\u037e (iii) having acted as an underwriter on Spirit\u2019s 2026 convertible notes in\nApril 2021\u037e (iv) having acted as an advisor on Spirit\u2019s registered direct offering and repurchase in April 2021\u037e (v) having served as a lender under Spirit\u2019s\nexisting revolving credit facility\u037e and (vi) having provided advisory services to Spirit on its assessment of certain strategic alternatives, including the\nprior transaction and (b) for JetBlue (i) having served as an active bookrunner on JetBlue\u2019s approximately $800 million Enhanced Equipment Trust\nCertificate offering in August 2020\u037e (ii) having served as a joint-bookrunning manager on JetBlue\u2019s offering of 41,975,000 shares in December 2020\u037e (iii)\nhaving served as an active bookrunner on JetBlue\u2019s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in March 2021\u037e and (iv) having served as a lender under\nJetBlue\u2019s existing revolving credit facility. During the period beginning January 1, 2020, through the date of rendering its opinion, the aggregate amount\nof fees that Barclays received from Spirit and JetBlue for the investment banking and financial services was approximately $17.6 million and $15.3 million,\nrespectively.\nBarclays, its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and\nother financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of Barclays\u2019 business, Barclays and its affiliates may actively trade and effect\ntransactions in the equity, debt and/or\n55\nTable of Contents\nother securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of Spirit and JetBlue for its own account\nand for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial\ninstruments.",

The summary of\nthe opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Spirit\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Spirit\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by Spirit management\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Spirit with senior executives of Spirit\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Spirit common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of Spirit and the prices and trading activity of Spirit common stock with that of certain other publicly\ntraded companies comparable with Spirit, and their securities\u037e\n\u2022\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Spirit and JetBlue and certain parties and their financial and\nlegal advisors\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents\u037e and\n56Table of Contents\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information\nthat was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by Spirit, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With\nrespect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of Spirit management of the future financial performance of Spirit. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,\nincluding, among other things, that the definitive merger agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan\nStanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents\nrequired for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the\ncontemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not\nsolicit, interest from any party with respect to any acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving Spirit. Morgan Stanley\ndid not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby\nor any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith.\nMorgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the\nassessment of Spirit and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax and regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with\nrespect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Spirit\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,\nrelative to the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares) in the transaction.\nMorgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the treatment of the Spirit convertible notes or the Spirit warrants pursuant to the merger\nagreement.

Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect\non, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, July 27, 2022. Events occurring after July 27, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion\nand the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its\nwritten opinion dated July 27, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed\nand factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or\nweight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered, without considering all\nanalyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Some of these summaries of\nfinancial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Furthermore,\nmathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.\nFor purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the analyses described below, and with the consent of Spirit management, Morgan Stanley has assumed\nthat the merger consideration is $33.50 per share in cash.\n57\nTable of Contents\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or\nbefore July 26, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date of the meeting of the Spirit board of directors at which Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,\nand is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Capitalization information for Spirit, including fully-diluted number of shares and balance\nsheet information, was provided on July 25, 2022 by Spirit management to Morgan Stanley, and was approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nuse in its financial analyses.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon the Spirit Financial Forecasts,\nas more fully described in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which were approved by Spirit management for\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s use in connection with its financial analyses.\nPublic Trading Benchmark Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading benchmark analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Spirit with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that, in Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment, share certain similar business\ncharacteristics with and have certain comparable operating characteristics, including, among other things, product characteristics, similarly sized revenue\nand/or revenue growth rates, market capitalization, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics, to those of Spirit (which companies\nare referred to as the comparable companies) (which we refer to as the \u201cSpirit Consensus Forecasted Financial Information of Spirit\u201d). JetBlue was\nincluded in the group of comparable companies.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of adjusted enterprise value (which we refer to as \u201cAdj. EV\u201d), which Morgan Stanley\ndefined as fully diluted market capitalization plus total debt, including capitalized operating lease liabilities, plus preferred stock, plus non-controlling\ninterest, less cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities and short term investments), to EBITDAR, which Morgan Stanley defined as\noperating income plus depreciation, amortization and rent expense plus addbacks for certain one-time costs, in each case estimated for the calendar year\n2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E Adj. EV / EBITDAR. Morgan Stanley also analyzed the ratio of price per share as of July 26, 2022 to\nearnings per share estimated for the calendar year 2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E P / E. The Spirit (Unaffected) market data was as\nof February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit\u2019s share price, reflecting the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Frontier merger\nagreement). The Spirit (JETS Adjusted) market data was as of February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit\u2019s share price, reflecting the last trading day\nprior to the announcement of the Frontier merger agreement), but the Spirit share price was adjusted for the percentage change in the US Global Jets ETF\nbetween February 4, 2022 and July 26, 2022.\nThe below tables summarize the companies, the metrics and the multiples employed in this analysis:\n2023E\nAdj.

Morgan Stanley applied\n58\nTable of Contents\nthe selected reference range to the corresponding financial estimates set forth in the Spirit Financial Forecasts and the Spirit Consensus Forecasted\nFinancial Information of Spirit. Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis resulted in the following implied fully diluted share prices for Spirit common stock (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.25):\n2023E Adj.

In\nselecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to size, business mix, industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Spirit. These include,\namong other things, the impact of competition on Spirit\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material\nchange in the financial condition and prospects of Spirit, the industry, or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of\nSpirit or the companies to which it is being compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on Spirit, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the\npresent value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range\nof per share equity values for Spirit.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone unlevered free cash flows that Spirit was forecasted to generate for the nine\nmonths ending December 31, 2022 and calendar years 2023 through 2026 on a standalone basis. Financial data used in this analysis were based on the\nSpirit Financial Forecasts.\nMorgan Stanley performed this analysis on the estimated future cash flows contained in the Spirit Financial Forecasts as set forth in the section entitled\n\u201c\u2014Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d For purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as Adjusted EBITDAR less\nrent expense, less unlevered cash tax expense (taking into account net operating losses and other differences between accounting tax expense and cash\ntaxes paid), less change in net working capital, less change in deferred heavy maintenance, less capital expenditures (including pre-delivery deposits for\nflight equipment, net of refunds, and proceeds from sale of property and equipment), plus certain other non-cash expenses. These estimated unlevered\nfree cash flows were reviewed and approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use.\nMorgan Stanley calculated terminal values for Spirit by applying a range of multiples of Adj. EV / EBITDAR of 5.5x to 7.0x, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nprofessional judgment, to the Adjusted EBITDAR of Spirit for the\n59\nTable of Contents\ncalendar year 2026. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the terminal value for the capitalized operating leases at December 31, 2026 (based on the Spirit\nFinancial Forecasts) and discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present value as of March 31, 2022 using mid-year convention\n(except for terminal value which was discounted using end-of-period methodology) and a range of discount rates from 10.6% to 12.2%, which were\nselected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment to reflect an estimate of Spirit\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (which we refer to as\n\u201cWACC\u201d). The WACC was determined utilizing the capital asset pricing model to calculate Spirit\u2019s cost of equity and estimated blended interest rate for\nSpirit\u2019s secured and unsecured debt as the basis for Spirit\u2019s cost of debt. To calculate the implied per share equity value, Morgan Stanley then divided the\nimplied equity value by the number of fully diluted shares of Spirit common stock outstanding as of July 25, 2022, as provided by Spirit management on\nJuly 25, 2022 using the treasury stock method.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of Spirit common stock on a fully-diluted basis\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25):\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nImplied Equity\nValue\nPer Share Range\nSpirit Financial Forecasts\n$\n26.00\u2013$48.25\nMorgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company\nas a function of the company\u2019s estimated future earnings. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value for such company\u2019s potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present\nequity values per share on a stand-alone basis for Spirit.\nTo calculate the discounted equity value for Spirit, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated calendar year 2025 EBITDAR and estimated calendar year 2025\nearnings per share based on the Spirit Financial Forecasts. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience after reviewing and\ncomparing certain financial estimates for Spirit, Morgan Stanley applied a range of multiples of Adj.

The ranges were as follows:\nHistorical Period\nHistorical Per\nShare\nRange for Spirit\n52-Week Trading Range ended on February 4, 2022\n$\n20.04\u2013$39.74\n52-Week Trading Range ended on July 26, 2022\n$\n16.35\u2013$28.51\nMorgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.\nThe historical trading range analysis was presented for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.\nDiscounted Analyst Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for Spirit common stock, prepared and published by selected equity research analysts\nprior to July 26, 2022, based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates. These forward targets reflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of\nthe 12-month future public market trading price of Spirit common stock. Morgan Stanley discounted to March 31, 2022, these 12-month future market\ntrading price estimates by the estimated cost of equity for Spirit of 12.9%, which discount rates were selected based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional\njudgment and experience.\nThe indicative discounted value range of the research analysts\u2019 price targets was $21.25 to $32.00 per share for Spirit common stock.\nMorgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading prices for shares of\nSpirit common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Spirit as well as future market\nconditions.\nThe discounted analyst price targets analysis was presented for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon by Morgan Stanley for valuation\npurposes.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the Spirit board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not\n61\nTable of Contents\nattribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without\nconsidering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley\nmay have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or\nless probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to\nbe Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual value of Spirit. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with\nrespect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond\nthe control of Spirit. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Spirit\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and\nthe absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Spirit, the industry, or the financial markets in general. Any\nestimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares) and in connection with the delivery of\nits written opinion, dated July 27, 2022, to the Spirit board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which\nshares of Spirit common stock might actually trade.\nThe merger consideration was determined by Spirit and JetBlue through arm\u2019s length negotiations between Spirit and JetBlue and was approved by the\nSpirit board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided financial advice to the Spirit board of directors during these negotiations but did not, however,\nrecommend any specific merger consideration to Spirit or the Spirit board of directors or opine that any specific merger consideration constituted the only\nappropriate merger consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other\nalternative business or financial strategies or transaction or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available, nor did it address the\nunderlying business decision of Spirit to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with the merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not in\nany manner address the price at which Spirit common stock would trade at any time, or any compensation or compensation agreements arising from (or\nrelating to) the merger which benefit any officer, director, employee of Spirit, or any class of such persons, and was not intended to and did not express\nany opinion or recommendation as to how the Spirit stockholders should vote at the stockholders\u2019 meeting to be held in connection with the merger.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Spirit board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Spirit board of\ndirectors in deciding to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Consequently, the analyses as\ndescribed above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Spirit board of directors with respect to the merger consideration or of\nwhether the Spirit board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different merger consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a\ncommittee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its\nsecurities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime\nbrokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at\nany time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and\neffect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of JetBlue, Spirit, or any other company,\nor any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Spirit board of directors with financial advisory services and a financial opinion,\ndescribed in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex\n62\nTable of Contents\nC, in connection with the merger, and Spirit has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $20.0 million, $1.75 million of which was paid in\nconnection with a separate engagement between Morgan Stanley and Spirit and is creditable against the fees for this transaction, $3 million of which was\npaid upon the delivery of Morgan Stanley\u2019s fairness opinion to the Spirit board of directors in connection with Spirit\u2019s merger agreement with Frontier, $3\nmillion of which became payable upon the delivery of Morgan Stanley\u2019s fairness opinion to the Spirit board of directors in connection with Spirit\u2019s merger\nagreement with JetBlue, and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon, and will be paid upon, the consummation of the merger. Spirit also agreed\nto reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred from time to time in connection with its engagement. In addition, Spirit\nagreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any,\ncontrolling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates, against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses relating to, arising out of or in\nconnection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement.\nIn the two years prior to July 5, 2022, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided (i) financial advisory and financing services to Spirit for which\nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates received aggregate fees of between $10 million and $25 million and (ii) financing services to JetBlue for which Morgan\nStanley and its affiliates received aggregate fees of between $15 million and $25 million. As of the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley or an affiliate\nthereof is a lender to Spirit and JetBlue. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Spirit and JetBlue and their\nrespective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.",

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights in the Merger\nUnder the DGCL, Spirit stockholders have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of Spirit\ncommon stock as determined by the Court of Chancery, together with\n77Table of Contents\ninterest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These\nrights are known as appraisal rights. Spirit stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL\nin order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.\nThe following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed by a stockholder in\norder to perfect appraisal rights in connection with the merger. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated\nby reference herein in its entirety. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of\nyour appraisal rights. All references in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares of Spirit common stock unless otherwise\nindicated.\nSection 262 of the DGCL requires that, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, stockholders for whom\nappraisal rights are available be notified not less than twenty days before the stockholders meeting to vote on the merger in connection with which\nappraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to\nSpirit stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL\nand a copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached hereto as Annex D. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should\ncarefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex D to this proxy statement, since failure to timely and properly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.\nAny stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights should consider consulting legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.\nIf you wish to exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Spirit common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:\n\u2022\nYou must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is taken. This written\ndemand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption and\napproval of the merger agreement and the merger. Voting against or failing to vote for the merger proposal by itself does not constitute a\ndemand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the\nstockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make a written\ndemand before the vote with respect to the merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\n\u2022\nYou must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the merger proposal. A vote in favor of the merger proposal, by proxy submitted by\nmail, over the Internet, by telephone or virtually during the special meeting, will cause you to lose your appraisal rights in respect of the\nshares so voted and will nullify any written demands for appraisal you previously submitted. A proxy which does not contain voting\ninstructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal. Therefore, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights must vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the merger proposal.\n\u2022\nYou must continue to hold your shares of Spirit common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the merger.\nTherefore, a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of Spirit common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made but\nwho thereafter transfers the shares before the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with respect to such shares.\n\u2022\nYou must otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.\n78\nTable of Contents\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration (without interest\nand subject to any required tax withholding), but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Spirit common stock.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Spirit common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for\nappraisal in respect of shares of Spirit common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and correctly, as his, her or its name\nappears on his, her or its stock certificates, and must state that such person intends thereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Spirit common\nstock in connection with the merger. If shares of Spirit common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if the shares of Spirit common stock are owned of record by more\nthan one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an\nauthorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal on behalf of a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner or\nowners. If the shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the\nshares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners\u037e in such case,\nhowever, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned,\nwe will presume that the demand covers all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you hold your shares of Spirit common stock in a brokerage\naccount or in other nominee form and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker or the other nominee to determine the\nappropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.\nBeneficial owners of shares of Spirit common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who desires appraisal should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure\nthat a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of such shares. Shares held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial\ninstitutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co. Any beneficial\nholder desiring appraisal who holds shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for\nappraisal is made by the record holder. The beneficial holder of such shares should instruct such firm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal be\nmade by the record holder of the shares, which may be the nominee of a central security depository if the shares have been so deposited. As required by\nSection 262, a demand for appraisal must reasonably inform Spirit of the identity of the holder(s) of record (which may be a nominee as described above)\nand of such holder\u2019s intention to seek appraisal of such shares.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be addressed to Spirit at Spirit Airlines, Inc., 2800 Executive Way, Miramar,\nFlorida 33025, and must be delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting.\nWithin ten days after the effective date of the merger, Spirit, as the surviving corporation, must give written notice that the merger has become effective to\neach stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL, has properly delivered a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of\nthe merger agreement and the merger. At any time within sixty days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has demanded an\nappraisal, and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding) specified by the merger\nagreement for his, her or its shares of Spirit common stock by delivering to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for\nappraisal. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only with the written consent of Spirit, as the surviving corporation.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will, upon\nwritten request to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth\n79\nTable of Contents\nthe aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger agreement and the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have\nbeen received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Spirit common stock held in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, request from the corporation the statement described in the\nprevious sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the requesting stockholder within ten days after such written request is received by the\nsurviving corporation or within ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Within 120 days after the\neffective time of the merger, but not thereafter, either Spirit, as the surviving corporation, or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of\nSection 262 of the DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the\nfair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Spirit common stock held in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the\nfiling of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon Spirit, as the surviving corporation. If no such petition is filed\nwithin that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. Spirit, as the\nsurviving corporation, has no obligation to file such a petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders. There is no present intent on the part of\nSpirit to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Spirit will file such a petition or that Spirit\nwill initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should\ninitiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the\nDGCL.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, Spirit will then be\nobligated, within twenty days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was\nfiled, a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements\nas to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court of Chancery,\nmust give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice must also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the\nday of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court of Chancery\ndeems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication must be approved by the Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof will be borne by\nthe surviving corporation. At the hearing on such petition, the Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who\nhave demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss\nthe proceedings as to that stockholder. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible\nfor appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nAfter determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of Spirit common stock, the Court of Chancery will appraise the shares,\ndetermining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL,\ninterest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, Spirit, as the surviving corporation,\n80\nTable of Contents\nmay pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if\nany, between the amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at\nthat time. Upon application by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of\nChancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal before the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock\nto the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to\nappraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. When the fair value is determined, the Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with\ninterest thereon, if any, by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, in the case of holders of uncertificated\nstock forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to Spirit of the certificates representing such stock.\nIn determining the fair value of the shares of Spirit common stock and, if applicable, interest, the Court of Chancery is required to take into account all\nrelevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community\nand otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value\nof a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court may consider market value, asset value, the negotiated\ntransaction price, the unaffected stock price, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as\nof the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that\nabsent deficiencies in the sale process the negotiated transaction price should be given \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d by the Court of Chancery in determining\nfair value. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass\nknown elements of value,\u201d but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,\nthe Delaware Supreme Court also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as\nof the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nYou should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Spirit common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same\nas, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to\nthe fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not\notherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nMoreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right\nto assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Spirit common stock is less than the\nper share merger consideration.\nCosts of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon Spirit, as the surviving corporation, and the stockholders participating in the appraisal\nproceeding by the Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery\nmay order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares\nentitled to appraisal. In the absence of an order, each party bears its own expenses. Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal\nrights in compliance with\n81\nTable of Contents\nSection 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive\npayments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date before the effective\ntime of the merger. If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written\nwithdrawal of his or her demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger within sixty days after the effective date of the merger or\nthereafter with the written approval of Spirit, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed, the appraisal\nproceeding in the Court of Chancery will not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be\nconditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the rights of any stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to\naccept the merger consideration that such holder would have received (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding) pursuant to the\nmerger agreement within sixty days after the effective date of the merger.\nIn view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult\ntheir legal advisors.",

JetBlue and Spirit filed a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the\nAntitrust Division and the FTC in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement on August 12, 2022. The initial waiting period is\nthirty days, but (i) this period may be shortened if the reviewing agency grants \u201cearly termination,\u201d (ii) it may be restarted if the acquiring person\nvoluntarily withdraws and re-files its Notification and Report Form, and/or (iii) it may be extended if the reviewing agency issues a request for additional\ninformation and documentary material (which we refer to as a \u201cSecond Request\u201d), in which case, the waiting period expires thirty days after the date when\nboth parties have substantially complied with such request though it is customary to reach a timing agreement with the Antitrust Division to not\nconsummate the proposed merger for a further period of time after substantial compliance. The merger is subject to such requirements, and JetBlue and\nSpirit expect that the Antitrust Division will issue a Second Request. The Antitrust Division will assess the legality under the antitrust laws of the\nproposed merger. At any time before or after the consummation of the proposed merger, the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking divestiture of the\nassets of JetBlue and/or Spirit or their respective subsidiaries. Private parties and individual state attorneys general may also bring legal actions under the\nantitrust laws. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the\nresult would be.\nCompetition Laws of Other Jurisdictions\nThe antitrust, competition or merger control laws of certain other countries in which Spirit and/or JetBlue operate may require the submission of a merger\ncontrol notification with, and the obtaining of the pre-merger approval of, antitrust or competition authorities therein. There can be no assurance that a\nchallenge to the merger on foreign antitrust or competition grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the result will be.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nIn addition to the antitrust related filings, clearances and approvals discussed above, JetBlue and Spirit must file notices with, and obtain any approvals\nand authorizations required to be obtained from, the DOT, the FAA and\n82Table of Contents\nthe FCC, as well as all other approvals and authorizations required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the merger and the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement from any other governmental authority.",

The Stein complaint also names as defendants\nFrontier and Top Gun Acquisition Corp.\nExcept for the Playford complaint, which was brought pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL demanding the right to inspect, among other things, certain\nbooks and records relating to the prior transaction with Frontier, each of the complaints alleges violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nand Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The complaints generally allege that the defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading registration\nstatement or proxy statement with the SEC. Each of the complaints seeks injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the prior transaction with\nFrontier, damages and other relief.\nThe Lo complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on June 10, 2022, the Crenshaw complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on\nJune 16, 2022, the Votto complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 18, 2022, the Stein complaint was voluntarily dismissed with\nprejudice on July 27, 2022, the Shuler complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 29, 2022, the Playford complaint was voluntarily\ndismissed with prejudice on August 8, 2022, the Hiebert complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on August 24, 2022 and the Justice\ncomplaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on August 24, 2022.\nAs of September 9, 2022, seven stockholder demand letters have been sent to Spirit by alleged Spirit stockholders in connection with the prior transaction\nwith Frontier.

Except for the Rachelefsky and Teamsters demand letters,\nwhich were sent pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL demanding the right to inspect, among other things, certain books and records relating to the prior\ntransaction with Frontier, each of the letters alleged disclosure deficiencies in the proxy statement soliciting stockholder approval of the Frontier merger\nagreement and demanded that additional disclosures be made before Spirit stockholders vote on the prior transaction with Frontier.\nSpirit believes that the claims asserted in the complaints and demand letters are without merit and have been mooted by (i) subsequent disclosures made\nby Spirit and (ii) the agreement between Spirit and Frontier on July 27, 2022 to mutually terminate the Frontier merger agreement. Spirit may receive\nadditional stockholder demand letters, and additional lawsuits related to the merger or the prior transaction with Frontier may be filed in the future.\n84\nTable of Contents",

Spirit will, promptly upon receipt or\n96Table of Contents\ndelivery thereof (and in any event, within twenty-four hours), provide JetBlue and its outside counsel with copies of all drafts and final versions of\ndefinitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits relating to such acquisition proposal, in each case exchanged between Spirit or any of its\nrepresentatives, on the one hand, and the person making such acquisition proposal or any of its representatives, on the other hand. Spirit will keep\nJetBlue reasonably informed of the status and terms (including with respect to any change in price or other material amendments) of any such acquisition\nproposal or other inquiry, request, offer or proposal concerning an acquisition proposal. Spirit will promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four hours\nfollowing a determination by the Spirit board of directors that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, notify JetBlue of such determination.\nHowever, if at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of (1) receipt of Spirit stockholder approval to adopt the merger and (2)\nthe termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms: (i) Spirit has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal from a third party\u037e (ii)\nsuch acquisition proposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of the merger agreement related to acquisition proposals\u037e (iii) the Spirit board of\ndirectors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could\nreasonably be likely to lead to a superior proposal\u037e (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith\nthat the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Spirit stockholders under applicable\nlaw\u037e and (v) Spirit receives from such person an executed acceptable confidentiality agreement\u037e then Spirit may take the following actions: (A) furnish\ninformation with respect to Spirit to the person or entity making such acquisition proposal pursuant to one or more acceptable confidentiality\nagreements\u037e and/or (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal regarding such acquisition\nproposal. In such event, Spirit must provide written notice to JetBlue of the determination referenced in clause (iii) and (iv) in the foregoing sentence\npromptly (and in any event, within twenty-four hours), and Spirit must provide to JetBlue in writing any information concerning Spirit provided to such\nother person or entity that was not previously provided to JetBlue or its representatives prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided\nto such other person or entity. Spirit will also deliver to JetBlue a copy of any executed acceptable confidentiality agreement promptly following its\nexecution.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement related to acquisition proposals, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the\neffective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, none of Spirit, the Spirit board of directors nor any\ncommittee thereof will, or will publicly propose to: (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, or modify in a manner adverse to JetBlue (or publicly propose to\nwithhold, withdraw, qualify or so modify), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Spirit board of directors or any such\ncommittee of the merger proposal\u037e (ii) fail to include the Spirit board of directors\u2019 recommendation in favor of the approval of the merger proposal in this\nproxy statement\u037e (iii) approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable)\nany acquisition proposal\u037e (iv) submit any acquisition proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the Spirit stockholders\u037e or (v) authorize,\ncommit, resolve or agree to take any such actions (each such action we refer to as a \u201cchange of company board recommendation\u201d).\nHowever, if: (i) Spirit has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal from a third party that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement and\nthat the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a superior\nproposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement that have been delivered to Spirit by JetBlue in\nwriting during the notice period provided pursuant thereto\u037e and (ii) the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its\noutside counsel, that a failure to make a change of company board recommendation and/or cause Spirit to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement\nwith respect to such superior proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the directors of Spirit to the\nSpirit stockholders under applicable law, then, prior to (but not after) the time the required stockholder vote for the merger proposal is obtained, the Spirit\nboard of directors may take the following actions: (y) effect a change of company board recommendation with respect to such superior proposal\u037e or (z)\nterminate\n97\nTable of Contents\nthe merger agreement pursuant to its terms and enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal. In connection with\nsuch termination of the merger agreement, Spirit would be required to pay JetBlue a termination fee of $94.2 million. In addition, prior to effecting such\nchange of company board recommendation or terminating the merger agreement, Spirit is required to: (A) provide prior written notice to JetBlue, at least\nfour business days in advance, of Spirit\u2019s intention to take such action with respect to such superior proposal, which notice will specify the material terms\nand conditions of such superior proposal (including all of the information that is specified in the merger agreement with respect to such superior\nproposal), together with a copy of all relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such superior proposal\u037e and (B) during such notice\nperiod, negotiate with JetBlue in good faith (to the extent JetBlue desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the\nmerger agreement so that such acquisition proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal, provided that in the event of any material revisions to the\nsuperior proposal, Spirit will be required to deliver a new written notice to JetBlue and to comply with the requirements of the merger agreement with\nrespect to such new written notice\u037e however, the notice period for any subsequent notice will be shortened from four business days to two business\ndays. The notice period (and any extension thereof) must have expired before Spirit effects any such change of company board recommendation or\nterminates the merger agreement.\nIn the event that prior to (but not after) the time the required stockholder vote for the merger proposal is obtained, the Spirit board of directors may make\na change of company board recommendation in response to any material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition (other than\nresulting from a breach of the merger agreement by Spirit) that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Spirit board of directors as of the date of\nthe merger agreement and becomes known to the Spirit board of directors after such date (which we refer to as an \u201cintervening event\u201d), if the Spirit board\nof directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel that, in light of such intervening event and taking into account the\nresults of any negotiations with JetBlue as provided by the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and any offer from JetBlue as provided by the\nterms and conditions of the merger agreement, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary\nduties to the Spirit stockholders under applicable law. However, the Spirit board of directors may not withdraw, modify or amend the Spirit board of\ndirectors recommendation in a manner adverse to JetBlue unless: (i) Spirit has provided prior written notice to JetBlue, at least four business days in\nadvance of Spirit\u2019s intention to make a change of company board recommendation, which notice specifies the Spirit board of directors\u2019 reason for\nproposing to effect such change of company board recommendation and will describe in reasonable detail the intervening event\u037e (ii) prior to effecting\nsuch change of company board recommendation, Spirit has negotiated with JetBlue in good faith (to the extent JetBlue desires to negotiate) to make such\nadjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Spirit board of directors to effect\nsuch change of company board recommendation\u037e (iii) JetBlue has not, during the applicable notice period, made an offer to modify the terms and\nconditions of the merger agreement, which is set forth in a definitive written amendment to the merger agreement delivered to Spirit and executed on\nbehalf of JetBlue and Merger Sub, that the Spirit board of directors has in good faith determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its\nfinancial advisor) would obviate the need for the Spirit board of directors to effect such change of company board recommendation\u037e and (iv) the\nintervening event notice period has expired. For purposes of this proxy statement, acquisition proposal means, with respect to JetBlue or Spirit, any offer\nor proposal from any person or group (other than JetBlue, Merger Sub or Spirit) concerning any, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,\ndirect or indirect: (i) merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving\nJetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, which would result in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning, directly or\nindirectly, more than 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or 20% of the voting power of the surviving entity in a merger\ninvolving JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or the resulting direct or indirect parent of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or such surviving entity (or any\nsecurities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power)\u037e (ii) sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license or other disposition\nof assets of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of JetBlue or Spirit (whether based on fair market value,\nrevenue generation or net income)\u037e (iii) issuance or sale by JetBlue or Spirit, as\n98\nTable of Contents\napplicable, of equity interests representing, convertible into or exchangeable for 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable\u037e (iv)\ntransaction in which any person or entity will acquire beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any group has been formed\nwhich beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, equity interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or\nSpirit, as applicable\u037e (v) any tender offer of exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or\nindirectly, in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit,\nas applicable\u037e or (vi) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the merger).\nFor purposes of this proxy statement, superior proposal means a bona fide written acquisition proposal (except the references therein to \u201c20%\u201d will be\nreplaced by \u201c50%\u201d) made by any person or group (other than JetBlue or any of its subsidiaries) after the date of the merger agreement, which acquisition\nproposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of the merger agreement that relate to acquisition proposal, that the Spirit board of directors has\ndetermined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and with its financial advisors: (i) would, if consummated, result in\na transaction that is more favorable to Spirit stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the merger (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms\nthat may be offered by JetBlue as provided by the terms and conditions of the merger agreement)\u037e and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated in\naccordance with the terms of such acquisition proposal, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such acquisition proposal.",

Except to the extent that the Spirit board of directors has made a recommendation change with respect to a\nSuperior Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), the Spirit board of directors is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its\nstockholders the vote required to adopt the merger agreement, including by communicating to its stockholders its recommendation (and including such\nrecommendation in this proxy statement) that they adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nNotwithstanding any Spirit change in recommendation, unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Spirit is required to\nconvene a meeting of its stockholders and to submit the merger agreement to a vote of such stockholders. Spirit must, at the request of JetBlue (to the\nextent permitted by Law), adjourn or postpone such meeting if there are insufficient shares of Spirit common stock represented (either in person or by\nproxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Spirit has not received proxies\nrepresenting a sufficient number of shares necessary for approval of the merger agreement.\nCertain Notices\nFrom and after the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, each party thereto will promptly notify the other party thereto of: (i)\nthe occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would or would be reasonably likely to (a) cause any condition to the obligations of any party to\neffect the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement not to be satisfied or (b) prevent or materially delay the consummation\nof the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (ii) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to\nbe complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to the merger agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of\nany party to effect the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement not to be satisfied\u037e (iii) receipt of any written notice to the\nreceiving party from any person alleging that the consent or approval of such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and the pursuit of such consent would (in the good faith determination of such party) reasonably be expected to\nprevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e or (iv) receipt of any notice or other\ncommunication from any governmental entity, the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any other securities market) in connection with the merger\u037e\nprovided, however, that the delivery of any such notice will not limit, cure any breach of or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant or\nagreement contained in the merger agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available under the merger agreement to the party receiving such\nnotice. Spirit will promptly notify JetBlue of any action (or threats of action) by the FAA or the DOT that materially amends, modifies, suspends, revokes,\nterminates, cancels or withdraws any Spirit permit or slots.\nPublic Announcements\nEach of Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub agreed that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement will be issued by any party without the prior written consent of Spirit and JetBlue (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed\nor conditioned), subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, including as such release or announcement may be required by applicable\nlaw or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or governmental entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which\ncase the party required to make the release or announcement will use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on\nsuch release or announcement in advance of such issuance.\n104\nTable of Contents\nState Takeover Laws\nIf any \u201ccontrol share acquisition,\u201d \u201cfair price,\u201d \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or other anti-takeover laws becomes or is deemed to be applicable to Spirit,\nJetBlue, Merger Sub or the merger, including the acquisition of shares of Spirit common stock pursuant thereto or any other transaction contemplated by\nthe merger agreement, then the Spirit board of directors will take all action necessary to render such law inapplicable to such entities and transactions.\nJetBlue Agreement Concerning Merger Sub\nJetBlue will cause Merger Sub to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement.\nSection 16 Matters\nPrior to the effective time of the Merger, the Spirit board of directors, or a duly authorized committee of non-employee directors thereof, will adopt a\nresolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of Spirit who is a covered person of Spirit\nfor purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as \u201cSection 16\u201d) of shares of Spirit common stock will be an exempt transaction for\npurposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\nSpirit Stock Exchange Delisting\u037e Deregistration\nSpirit and JetBlue will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the delisting of shares of Spirit common stock from the NYSE\nand the deregistration of such shares of Spirit common stock as promptly as practicable following the effective time of the merger in compliance with\napplicable law.\nStockholder Litigation\nSpirit will promptly provide JetBlue with any pleadings and correspondence relating to any suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other\nproceeding involving Spirit or any of its officers or directors or any other of its representatives relating to the merger agreement or the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and will keep JetBlue reasonably and promptly informed regarding the status of any suit, claim, action, hearing,\narbitration, investigation or other proceeding. Spirit will cooperate with and give JetBlue a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or\nsettlement of any such suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the\nprior written consent of JetBlue (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Spirit will also give JetBlue the right to review\nand comment on all filings or responses to be made by it in connection with any such suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other\nproceeding, and it will in good faith take such comments into account.\nTax Matters\nExcept for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by reason of payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the holder of record of\na certificate(s) representing Spirit common stock, each of Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub will pay any sales, use, ad valorem, property, transfer (including\nreal property transfer) and similar taxes imposed on Spirit, JetBlue or Merger Sub, as the case may be, as a result of or in connection with the transactions\ncontemplated under the merger agreement. The parties agreed to cooperate in good faith to prepare and timely deliver any certificate or instrument\nnecessary for a party to the merger agreement to claim an applicable exemption from any such taxes otherwise payable.\nSpirit Convertible Notes\nWithin the time periods required by the terms of the applicable indenture for Spirit\u2019s 2025 convertible notes and 2026 convertible notes (which we\ncollectively refer to as the \u201cconvertible notes indenture\u201d), Spirit agreed to take\n105\nTable of Contents\nall actions required by, or all commercially reasonable actions requested by JetBlue pursuant to and in compliance with, the convertible notes indenture to\nbe performed by Spirit as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including (i) the giving of any notices that may be required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue,\nand (ii) delivery to the trustee, the holders of Spirit\u2019s convertible notes or other applicable person, as applicable, of any instruments, certificates, opinions\nof Spirit\u2019s counsel or other documents required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue in connection with the execution,\ndelivery or performance of the merger agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or as otherwise required by, or reasonably requested by JetBlue\npursuant to or in compliance with, the convertible notes indenture. Spirit also agreed to deliver a copy of any such notice, instrument, certificate, opinion\nor other document to JetBlue at least three business days (or such shorter period of time as may be required to comply with the terms of the convertible\nnotes indenture) prior to delivering such notice or entering into such other document or instrument, and to consider any reasonable comments thereto\nproposed by JetBlue in good faith. Spirit and the surviving corporation will execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered, as applicable), in\naccordance with the convertible notes indenture, supplemental indentures and any other documents or instruments as may be requested by the trustee in\nconnection with the execution of such supplemental indentures, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the trustee and Spirit,\npursuant to and with such terms as required under the convertible notes indenture.\nPrior to the effective time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not take any action that would result in an adjustment to the \u201cConversion\nRate\u201d (as defined in the convertible notes indenture) of Spirit\u2019s convertible notes, other than in connection with the entry into or the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nExcept as provided for in the merger agreement, prior to the Effective Time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not amend the\nconvertible notes indenture. Prior to the effective time, Spirit will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture. Following the effective\ntime, the surviving corporation will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture.\nPrior to the effective time, Spirit will settle any conversions of (i) Spirit\u2019s 2025 convertible notes pursuant to \u201cPhysical Settlement\u201d (as defined in the\napplicable indenture) and (ii) Spirit\u2019s 2026 convertible notes pursuant to \u201cCash Settlement\u201d (as defined in the applicable indenture).\nFinancing\nJetBlue will, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, use reasonable best\nefforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange the debt financing and to\nconsummate the debt financing on the closing date.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a reputable bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company,\nto act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment and issuance of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger\n(the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d). At or immediately following the Effective Time (but in any event substantially concurrently with the Closing), Parent\nor Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to\npay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement\n(collectively, the \u201cPayment Fund\u201d). The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion,\npending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings resulting from such investments will be the sole and\nexclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings will accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. Any losses resulting from such\ninvestments shall not impact Parent\u2019s obligations under this Article 2, and in the event of any such losses, Parent shall take all actions\nnecessary to cause to deposit into the Payment Fund sufficient cash to satisfy Parent\u2019s obligations under this Article 2.\n(b)\nProcedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within three (3) Business Days thereafter),\nParent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the \u201cCertificates\u201d),\nwhich Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter\nof transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon\ndelivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the\nPaying Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the\nMerger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be\nappointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the\nholder of such Certificates will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates.\nAny Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates\nwill be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment\nof the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will\nbe a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for\ntransfer, and the Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the\nMerger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have established to the\nsatisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any holder of non-certificated Shares\nrepresented by book-entry (\u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the\nPaying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or\nmore Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the\nPaying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within three (3) Business\nDays thereafter), the Merger Consideration payable for each such Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to\nBook-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as\ncontemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.\nA-4Table of Contents\n(c)\nTransfer Books\u037e No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and\nthereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the\nholders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect\nto such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the\nSurviving Corporation for any reason, then (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.2(b)) they will be cancelled\nand exchanged as provided in this Agreement.\n(d)\nTermination of Payment Fund\u037e Abandoned Property\u037e No Liability. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the\nSurviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest\naccrued with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the\nSurviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable\nupon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b). If, prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time\n(or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any\nGovernmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Certificates has not complied\nwith the procedures in Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the\npayment in respect of such Certificates will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,\nfree and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving\nCorporation nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official\npursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.\n(e)\nLost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in\nexchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger\nConsideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof\u037e provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a\ncondition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to\ndeliver a customary affidavit of loss and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond as indemnity\nagainst any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the\nCertificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.\n(f)\nWithholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and any other applicable withholding\nagent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of\nShares or any other Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the\nCode and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law\u037e provided, that\nwithholding for Merger Consideration or other payments received in respect of Company RSU Awards, Company Performance Share\nAwards and 2022 Company Performance Share Awards shall be effected as cash and net share withholding in proportion to the type of\nconsideration payable to the holder thereof. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity,\nsuch withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or other Person in\nrespect of which such deduction and withholding was made.",
