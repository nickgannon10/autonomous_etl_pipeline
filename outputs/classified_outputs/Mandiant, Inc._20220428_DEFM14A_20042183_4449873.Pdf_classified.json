Parent intends to finance the transaction\nusing its cash on hand and has represented to us in the merger agreement that it has sufficient cash\nresources to pay the aggregate merger consideration.\nMandiant also has outstanding $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.875% convertible senior\nnotes due 2024 (which we refer to as the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d), $23.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.000%\nconvertible Series A senior notes due 2035 (which we refer to as the \u201cSeries A 2035 Notes\u201d) and $460 million\nin aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible Series B senior notes due 2035 (which we refer to as the\n\u201cSeries B 2035 Notes,\u201d and, together with the 2024 Notes and Series A 2035 Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d).\nOn the closing date of the merger, each series of Convertible Notes will be convertible into the merger\nconsideration at the then applicable conversion rate for the relevant series of Convertible Notes. Mandiant\nwill be required to make an offer to repurchase each series of Convertible Notes at 100 percent of their\nprincipal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable fundamental change\nrepurchase date (as defined in the applicable convertible notes indenture). The Series A 2035 Notes are also\nredeemable at the option of Mandiant, and after June 1, 2022, the Series B 2035 Notes will be redeemable at\nthe option of Mandiant, in each case at 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (as defined in the applicable convertible\nnotes indenture). Under the merger agreement, Mandiant has agreed to cooperate with Parent in the event\nthat Parent seeks to launch a tender offer with respect to any or all of the Convertible Notes. In connection\nwith the issuance of the 2024 Notes, Mandiant entered into capped call transactions (which we refer to as the\n\u201ccapped call transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions (which we refer to as the \u201coption\ncounterparties\u201d). The capped call transactions were expected by Mandiant to reduce the potential dilution to\nMandiant\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or to offset any cash payments that\nMandiant would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted 2024 Notes, as the\ncase may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap set forth in the capped call transactions. In\norder to hedge the risks of the option counterparties under or in respect of the capped call transactions, the\noption counterparties or their respective affiliates from time to time enter into or unwind various derivative\ntransactions with respect to Mandiant\u2019s common stock and/or purchase or sell Mandiant\u2019s common stock or\nother securities issued by Mandiant in secondary market transactions.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, Parent has the right to direct Mandiant to effect an early termination and\ncash settlement of all obligations in respect of the capped call transactions.

Under the merger\nagreement, Parent will acquire Mandiant for $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to\ncomplete the merger, our stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common\nstock and convertible preferred stock, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis, must vote to\nadopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of\nthe merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to\nthe Closing of the Merger.\u201d The Mandiant Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy\ncard to the holders of shares of our common stock and convertible preferred stock in connection with\nthe solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger,\nthe merger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The\nenclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without\nattending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and\nvoted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit\na proxy as soon as possible.\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Mandiant?\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Mandiant by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Mandiant, with Mandiant\ncontinuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Mandiant will become a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted\nfrom the Nasdaq. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we\nwill no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $23.00 in cash, without interest and less\nany applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own, unless you have\nproperly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the\nDGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of\nour common stock, you will receive $2,300.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock,\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nHow does the per share price compare to the market price of Mandiant\u2019s common stock?\nThis amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53 percent to the closing price of our common\nstock on February 7, 2022, which was the last full trading day before media reports that Mandiant was\npursuing a sale\u037e and (2) a premium of approximately 57 percent to Mandiant\u2019s unaffected 10-day volume\nweighted average price as of February 7, 2022.\n17 Q: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat will happen to Mandiant equity-based awards and Mandiant options?\nGenerally speaking, Mandiant equity-based awards and Mandiant options will be treated as follows:\nEach vested Mandiant restricted stock unit will accelerate vesting in full (to the extent not already\nvested) and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,\nequal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the exercise or purchase price per\nshare, if any, of such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit\u037e and (2) the total number of shares of our\ncommon stock then-subject to such vested Mandiant restricted stock unit.

See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?\nIf you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to\nrecognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-\nU.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax\nunless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a\nvalid exemption from backup withholding tax.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to\ndetermine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular\ncircumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any\nstate, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and\ndoes not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\n24 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the\nmerger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in\nthe merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and\nany extensions thereof, if any) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been\nterminated.\nOn April 20, 2022, Mandiant and Parent each received a Second Request from the DOJ in connection\nwith the DOJ\u2019s review of the merger. The issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period\nunder the HSR Act until 30 days after both Mandiant and Parent have substantially complied with the\nSecond Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or extended by agreement of\nMandiant and Parent.\nThe merger is also subject to clearances, consents, approvals and the waiting periods applicable to the\nmerger under certain foreign antitrust laws and FDI laws. Antitrust and FDI approvals of the merger are\nrequired in various jurisdictions throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. As of the date of this\nproxy statement, Mandiant and Parent have determined to make antitrust notifications in Saudi Arabia,\nIsrael, Taiwan and Turkey, and may make notifications in other jurisdictions.\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nIf the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement\u037e (2) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the effective time of\nthe merger\u037e (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares\u037e (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory\nrequirements as described in this proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise\nlose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the\nmerger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their\nshares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the \u201cfair value\u201d\nof their shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nmerger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair\nvalue from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five\npercent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to\ntime during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the\njudgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking\nappraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and\n(2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who\nwish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to\nthe exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements\nfor exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, which\ndescription is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached as\nAnnex B to this proxy statement.\nDo any of Mandiant\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Mandiant\nstockholders generally?\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Mandiant Board with respect to the proposal to adopt\nthe merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests\nin the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. In: (1)\nevaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e\nand (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the\n25 \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMandiant Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time,\namong other matters.

This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Mandiant\nBoard, the Transaction Committee (as defined below), our representatives, or other parties.\nThe Mandiant Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view\ntoward strengthening our business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the\nMandiant Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included,\namong others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with\nMandiant remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) the investment in, and development of, new products and\nservices\u037e (3) capital raising activities\u037e (4) potential expansion opportunities through partnerships or other\ncommercial relationships\u037e and (5) business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions and other financial and\nstrategic alternatives.\nIn 2019, the Mandiant Board explored potential strategic alternatives available to our company, with a focus\non a potential divestiture of our network, email, endpoint and cloud security products and the related\nsecurity management and orchestration platform (which we refer to as the \u201cFireEye Products business\u201d). We\nretained Goldman Sachs to provide us with financial advisory services in this process. Goldman Sachs was\nwell known to the Mandiant Board given Goldman Sachs\u2019 qualifications, extensive expertise, international\nreputation, knowledge of our industry and experience in advising companies in connection with potential\nstrategic transactions. The Mandiant Board ultimately determined not to pursue a strategic transaction at\nthat time. As a result of this process, however, the Mandiant Board determined that the divestiture of the\nFireEye Products business was a potentially attractive alternative that could enhance long-term stockholder\nvalue. Our engagement of Goldman Sachs was not terminated following this decision, and Goldman Sachs\ncontinued to advise us from time to time.\nOn November 19, 2020, we announced a $400 million strategic investment in us by Blackstone and ClearSky.\nWe used the proceeds of this investment, which closed on December 11, 2020, to support strategic growth\ninitiatives. Following this investment, we leveraged Blackstone\u2019s expertise as affiliates of a leading financial\ninstitution to support the transformation of our business.\nIn early 2021, we began, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs, to actively explore the sale of the FireEye\nProducts business as a potential means of enhancing long-term stockholder value. To assist in this process\n(as well as any decision by the Mandiant Board to explore strategic alternatives for the entire company), on\nMarch 4, 2021, the Mandiant Board established a transaction committee (which we refer to as the\n\u201cTransaction Committee\u201d). The Mandiant Board formed the Transaction Committee in light of (1) the\npotentially significant workload that could be involved in any decision by Mandiant to sell the FireEye\nProducts business or to consider other strategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that Mandiant management\nmay need feedback and direction on relatively short notice\u037e and (3) the benefits and convenience of having a\nsubset of directors oversee and direct the process of considering strategic alternatives. The Mandiant Board\nauthorized the Transaction Committee to, among other things, (1) consider, analyze and evaluate strategic\nalternatives available to the company\u037e (2) approach potential strategic and financial acquirers regarding\nstrategic alternatives, and to negotiate with such parties\u037e (3) oversee and provide assistance to Mandiant\nmanagement and our advisers with respect to the consideration, analysis and evaluation of any strategic\nalternative\u037e (4) take all other actions that the Transaction Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or\ndesirable\u037e and (5) recommend to the Mandiant Board what action, if any, should be taken with respect to any\nstrategic alternative. The Mandiant Board retained the power and authority to approve the final decision on\npursuing a strategic alternative. It was also understood that the Mandiant Board would\n37 TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontinue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. The Mandiant Board appointed\nKimberly Alexy, Viral Patel and Enrique Salem as the members of the Transaction Committee. The Mandiant\nBoard did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the Transaction Committee in\nconsideration of their service on the committee (other than their compensation as members of the Mandiant\nBoard).\nOn June 2, 2021, we announced our intention to sell the FireEye Products business to affiliates of Symphony\nTechnology Group. We refer to this transaction as the \u201cFireEye Divestiture.\u201d\nDuring June 2021 and July 2021, Kevin Mandia, our chief executive officer, spoke, on an individual basis,\nwith members of the Mandiant Board about the possibility and advisability of exploring other strategic\nalternatives for Mandiant following the completion of the FireEye Divestiture, including a possible sale of\nMandiant. The members of the Mandiant Board expressed support for Mr. Mandia having introductory\nconversations with a limited number of strategic and financial acquirers who were most likely to have an\ninterest in an acquisition of us. Mr. Mandia subsequently engaged in these discussions. Due to Mr. Mandia\nand other members of Mandiant management being focused on executing the FireEye Divestiture, these\ndiscussions did not advance beyond the introductory stage until late September 2021.\nOn September 22, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with members of management of a potential strategic acquirer\n(which we refer to as \u201cStrategic A\u201d) concerning Strategic A\u2019s possible interest in considering an acquisition\nof us.\nOn October 4, 2021, in connection with the pending FireEye Divestiture, our company was renamed\nMandiant.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed the FireEye Divestiture, at which time our business became focused\nentirely on our controls-agnostic cybersecurity solutions and services.\nOn October 11, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with representatives of a potential financial\nacquirer (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial A\u201d) concerning Financial A\u2019s possible interest in considering an\nacquisition of us. This meeting occurred at Financial A\u2019s request.\nAlso on October 11, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a member of management of a potential strategic acquirer\n(which we refer to as \u201cStrategic B\u201d) concerning Strategic B\u2019s possible interest in considering an acquisition\nof us.\nOn October 19, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with members of management of Strategic B concerning Strategic B\u2019s\npossible interest in considering an acquisition of us.\nOn October 22, 2021, Frank Verdecanna, our chief financial officer, spoke with a member of management of\nStrategic B concerning our business and prospects.\nOn October 23, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a member of management of Strategic B concerning Strategic\nB\u2019s possible interest in considering an acquisition of us.\nOn October 24, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a representative of Financial A concerning Financial A\u2019s\npossible interest in considering an acquisition of us.\nOn November 3, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of Strategic B\nconcerning our business and prospects.\nOn November 9, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of Strategic A\nconcerning our business and prospects.\nOn November 17, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a member of management of a potential strategic acquirer\n(which we refer to as \u201cStrategic C\u201d) concerning Strategic C\u2019s possible interest in considering an acquisition\nof us.\nAlso on November 17, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of\nStrategic A concerning our business and prospects.\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn mid-November 2021, it was determined that sufficient interest in an acquisition of us had been expressed\nto warrant the involvement of Goldman Sachs to assist the Mandiant Board in considering strategic\nalternatives for Mandiant.\nOn December 7, 2021, members of the Mandiant Board and members of Mandiant management met informally\nwith representatives of Goldman Sachs. During this meeting, the representatives of Goldman Sachs provided\ntheir perspective on market conditions and mergers and acquisitions activity in the cybersecurity and\ntechnology space, and also discussed Goldman Sachs\u2019 preliminary views on our stock price performance and\ncompared it to certain other companies and the broader market. The representatives of Goldman Sachs\ndiscussed strategic alternatives available to Mandiant, including (1) the continuation of our current business\nplan with Mandiant remaining as an independent company\u037e and (2) a sale of Mandiant. As part of this\ndiscussion, the representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Goldman Sachs\u2019 preliminary view, in its judgment\nand experience, as to the most likely potential strategic and financial acquirers of Mandiant based on, among\nother things, Goldman Sachs\u2019 assessment of (1) the strategic fit of Mandiant with each potential acquirer\u037e\nand (2) the ability and likelihood of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an acquisition of\nus. After considering our near- and long-term prospects as an independent company, it was the consensus\nof the members of the Mandiant Board participating in the discussion that (1) a sale of Mandiant in the near\nterm could be in the best interests of Mandiant and our stockholders\u037e (2) a more formalized review of our\nstrategic alternatives should commence\u037e (3) it was appropriate to use a targeted, private process focused on\nthe potential strategic and financial acquirers most likely to have an interest in acquiring us\u037e (4) Goldman\nSachs should make initial or renewed contact with the most likely potential strategic acquirers (including\nParent, Strategic A, Strategic B and Strategic C) and financial acquirers (including Financial A) regarding\ntheir interest in an acquisition of us\u037e (5) depending on the outcome of these contacts by Goldman Sachs, it\nwould be appropriate for Mandiant management to proceed with more in-depth discussions with these\nparties concerning a possible acquisition of us\u037e and (6) the Transaction Committee should oversee this\nprocess.\nFollowing the December 7, 2021 meeting, we began a more formalized process of reviewing strategic\nalternatives. During this process, Goldman Sachs, as directed and on our behalf, ultimately contacted seven\npotential strategic acquirers and five potential financial acquirers regarding their interest in considering an\nacquisition of us. In support of the process, representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed Mandiant from\ntime to time with potential strategic and financial acquirers in order to better understand their interest in an\nacquisition of us. We also entered into, or were already a party to, confidentiality agreements with all seven\npotential strategic acquirers and four of the potential financial acquirers. Certain of these confidentiality\nagreements contained a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision\u037e none of these confidentiality agreements prohibited the\ncounterparty from making a public or private proposal to acquire all of our common stock. Two of the seven\npotential strategic acquirers (one of which was Strategic C) and one of the potential financial acquirers did\nnot pursue any further engagement in respect of an acquisition of us.\nOn December 8, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a senior executive of Financial A concerning Financial A\u2019s\ninterest in a possible acquisition of us.\nOn December 15, 2021, members of Mandiant management met with members of management of Strategic A to\ndiscuss general due diligence matters.\nAlso on December 15, 2021, members of Mandiant management gave a management presentation regarding\nour company to Strategic B.\nAlso on December 15, 2021, the Mandiant Board met, with members of Mandiant management in attendance.\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Verdecanna provided a general update on the current status of our exploration of\npotential strategic alternatives.\nOn December 17, 2021, members of Mandiant management gave a management presentation regarding our\ncompany to Parent.\nOn December 20, 2021, Mr. Mandia spoke with a senior executive of Strategic B concerning Strategic B\u2019s\ninterest in a possible acquisition of us.\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on December 20, 2021, members of Mandiant management gave a management presentation regarding\nour company to a potential strategic acquirer (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic D\u201d).\nOn December 23, 2021, members of Mandiant management gave a management presentation regarding our\ncompany to a potential strategic acquirer (which we refer to as \u201cStrategic E\u201d).\nAlso on December 23, 2021, the Transaction Committee determined to hold weekly committee meetings, with\nall Mandiant Board members being invited to such meetings.\nOn December 26, 2021, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board, members\nof Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance.

Members of Mandiant management provided a general update on the\nstatus of discussions with Parent, Strategic A and Strategic B, noting that each continued to consider an\nacquisition. Members of Mandiant management reviewed with the Mandiant Board a draft of the Projected\nFinancial Information for the period of 2022 to 2035 and described, among other things, the process for\npreparing the Projected Financial Information, including the underlying assumptions and various execution\nand other risks to realizing the Projected Financial Information.

The representatives of Goldman\nSachs informed the senior executive of Strategic A that all parties in the process had been provided with\ngenerally consistent levels of information at that point and encouraged the senior executive of Strategic A to\nspeak with Mr. Mandia that day to the extent that such discussion would be helpful to Strategic A. The\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs further suggested that if Strategic A were interested in acquiring\nMandiant, then Strategic A should submit a written acquisition proposal by the bid deadline on February 21,\n2022, given the possibility that the Mandiant Board could decide at that point not to engage further with\nparties who had not submitted a written proposal. The senior executive of Strategic A acknowledged this\nsuggestion and expressed interest in speaking further with Mr. Mandia.\nLater on February 20, 2022, the senior executive of Strategic A spoke to Mr. Mandia and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reiterated the importance of Strategic A submitting a\nwritten acquisition proposal by the bid deadline of February 21, 2022, if Strategic A were interested in a\npotential acquisition, given the possibility that the Mandiant Board could determine not to engage further\nwith parties who had not submitted a timely written proposal. The senior executive of Strategic A again\nacknowledged this suggestion.\nAlso on February 20, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,\nmembers of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives\nof Goldman Sachs provided the Transaction Committee, for the information of the Transaction Committee and\nthe Mandiant Board, materials that summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the\nannouncement and of the consummation of an acquisition of us on the capped call transactions that we had\nentered into with Goldman Sachs and other counterparties, each acting as principal for its own account, with\nrespect to our convertible notes, as well as the relationship disclosures previously provided by Goldman\nSachs. The Transaction Committee did not identify any concerns with these disclosures. The representatives\nof Goldman Sachs reviewed Goldman Sachs\u2019 preliminary financial analyses of Mandiant. The Transaction\nCommittee discussed next steps if we were to receive an acquisition proposal.\nOn February 21, 2022, Mr. Mandia spoke with a senior executive of Parent. During this discussion, the senior\nexecutive of Parent stated that Parent would be submitting a non-binding written proposal to acquire us.\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on February 21, 2022, Parent submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire us for $22.00 in cash\nper share of our common stock. Parent also requested that we agree to negotiate exclusively with Parent\nthrough March 19, 2022.\nAlso on February 21, 2022, a senior executive of Strategic A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that,\nalthough Strategic A would not be submitting an acquisition proposal on that date, it remained interested in\nconsidering an acquisition of us.\nOn February 22, 2022, representatives of Strategic B informed Mr. Mandia that Strategic B was no longer\nconsidering an acquisition of us.\nLater on February 22, 2022, the Mandiant Board met, with members of Mandiant management and\nrepresentatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The results of the strategic\nreview process overseen by Goldman Sachs were noted, including that only Parent and Strategic A were still\nconsidering an acquisition of us in any respect. The terms of the acquisition proposal submitted by Parent\n(including the request to negotiate on an exclusive basis), and the recent communication from Strategic A,\nwere discussed. The Mandiant Board noted (1) the significant due diligence already undertaken by Parent\u037e\n(2) Parent\u2019s desire to proceed quickly toward announcement of an acquisition\u037e (3) the more limited due\ndiligence that had been undertaken by Strategic A as compared to Parent\u037e (4) Strategic A\u2019s failure to provide\na written acquisition proposal by the bid deadline of February 21, 2022\u037e (5) the possibility that Parent would\nwithdraw its acquisition proposal if it was not promptly accepted by Mandiant\u037e and (6) the perceived level of\nstrategic fit, as well as regulatory considerations and deal certainty, with respect to Parent compared to\nStrategic A. Given these considerations, the Mandiant Board determined that it wished to continue to work\ntoward a transaction with Parent. The Mandiant Board instructed Goldman Sachs to make a counterproposal\nto Parent for an acquisition of us for $24.00 in cash per share of our common stock, with an exclusive\nnegotiation period ending on March 9, 2022. The Mandiant Board also requested a conversation between\nEnrique Salem, our chairman of the board, Mr. Mandia and Sundar Pichai, Parent\u2019s chief executive officer, to\ndiscuss Parent\u2019s institutional commitment to the acquisition. Mr. Mandia confirmed to the Mandiant Board\nthat neither he nor any member of Mandiant management had engaged in discussions with Parent regarding\nany post-acquisition employment terms with Parent. The Mandiant Board also authorized the Transaction\nCommittee to oversee negotiations with Parent and, if it determined appropriate, to authorize us to enter into\nan exclusivity agreement with Parent.\nFollowing the meeting of the Mandiant Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed members of\nmanagement of Parent of the counterproposal from the Mandiant Board. Later, in a subsequent conversation\nwith representatives of Goldman Sachs, Parent agreed to increase its acquisition proposal to $23.00 in cash\nper share of our common stock and to shorten the exclusivity period to end at 6:00 a.m., Pacific time, on\nMarch 10, 2022. Parent also agreed to arrange the requested call between Messrs. Salem, Mandia and Pichai.\nLater on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,\nmembers of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The Transaction\nCommittee discussed the terms of the latest acquisition proposal from Parent and agreed to meet again when\nParent provided its revised proposal in writing and its updated exclusivity agreement.\nFollowing the meeting of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs received multiple\ncalls from a senior executive of Strategic A. In these calls, the senior executive of Strategic A (1) stated that\nStrategic A remained interested in considering an acquisition of us\u037e and (2) requested assistance in thinking\nabout an appropriate price for an acquisition. The representatives of Goldman Sachs declined to provide\nsuch assistance, but stated that they would convey Strategic A\u2019s interest to Mandiant.\nLater on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,\nmembers of Mandiant management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. A representative of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Transaction Committee\ntheir fiduciary duties. It was noted that the requested call between Messrs. Salem, Mandia and Pichai had\nbeen arranged and would be occurring shortly. The representatives of Goldman Sachs described their recent\ndiscussions with a senior executive of Strategic A. The Transaction Committee noted the same factors\nregarding Parent and Strategic A that were noted in the meeting of the Mandiant Board earlier\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin the day. The Transaction Committee directed Goldman Sachs to inform Strategic A that it should submit a\nwritten acquisition proposal not later than that evening, and that the per share price in any such proposal\nshould reflect a premium of well above 50 percent over our stock price prior to speculation that we were\npursuing a sale process. Such a premium would imply a price of well above $22.59 per share of our common\nstock, although representatives of Goldman Sachs did not provide this number to Strategic A. Messrs.\nMandia and Salem then departed the meeting to speak with Mr. Pichai.\nFollowing the meeting of the Transaction Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed a senior\nexecutive of Strategic A as instructed by the Transaction Committee. The senior executive of Strategic A\ninformed the representatives of Goldman Sachs that Strategic A would further consider an acquisition of us\nand would respond that evening.\nStill later on February 22, 2022, the Transaction Committee met, with other members of the Mandiant Board,\nmembers of Mandiant management and representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance. The terms of\nParent\u2019s acquisition proposal at $23.00 in cash per share of our common stock (which by this time had been\nput in writing), including the updated exclusivity agreement, were discussed. Messrs. Salem and Mandia\ndiscussed their conversation with Mr. Pichai and noted their satisfaction with the level of institutional\ncommitment to the acquisition expressed by Mr. Pichai. The representatives of Goldman Sachs departed the\nmeeting to take a call from the senior executive of Strategic A. During this call, the senior executive of\nStrategic A stated that Strategic A was unable to submit an acquisition proposal that evening. The\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs rejoined the meeting and informed the Transaction Committee of the\nconversation with Strategic A. The Transaction Committee determined to move forward with the acquisition\nproposal from Parent and to agree to negotiate with Parent on an exclusive basis through 6:00 a.m., Pacific\ntime, on March 10, 2022. Parent and Mandiant subsequently entered into an exclusivity agreement.\nBeginning on February 23, 2022, Parent and its advisors were granted access to legal and operational due\ndiligence documents and information in an electronic data room to support their due diligence review of\nMandiant. Over the following days, members of management of Parent and representatives of Parent\u2019s\nadvisors conducted operational, legal, financial, accounting, employment and other due diligence on\nMandiant.

In\nrecommending that Mandiant stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement, the Mandiant\nBoard considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not\nnecessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and\nanalyses, and the factors discussed below, the Mandiant Board concluded that entering into the merger\nagreement was advisable and in the best interests of Mandiant and our stockholders.\nThe Mandiant Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination\nand recommendation:\nFinancial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Mandiant\u037e Risks of Execution. The\ncurrent, historical and projected financial condition, results of operations and business of Mandiant,\nas well as Mandiant\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular,\nthe Mandiant Board considered Mandiant\u2019s long-term operating plan (as reflected in the Projected\nFinancial Information). As part of this, the Mandiant Board considered the potential opportunities\nthat Mandiant\u2019s long-term operating plan presented against, among other things, various execution\nand other risks to achieving the long-term operating plan and related uncertainties, including: (1) the\nrisks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing Mandiant\u2019s current business plan\nand long-term operating plan in the short and long term\u037e (2) the impact of market, customer and\ncompetitive trends on Mandiant\u037e and (3) the general risks related to market conditions that could\nreduce the price of our common stock. Among the potential risks identified by the Mandiant Board\nwere:\nMandiant\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among\nthese risks were consideration of (1) Mandiant\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources, relative\n47 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto those of its competitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e and (3) the substantial\nrisks to achieving Mandiant\u2019s long-term operating plan.\nThe difficulty of implementing the various business transformation initiatives currently being\nundertaken, and anticipated to be undertaken, by Mandiant, including in respect of efforts to\nimprove our cost structure. The Mandiant Board noted that these initiatives required sustained\neffort on our part and were not certain to result in a more valuable company.\nInvestments required to implement new systems to further drive Mandiant\u2019s business, including\nthe need for a new enterprise resource planning system.\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly\ntraded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The Mandiant\nBoard was aware that the price of our common stock could be negatively impacted if Mandiant\nfailed to meet investor expectations, including if Mandiant failed to meet its growth objectives.\nThe historical execution of Mandiant\u2019s business plan by Mandiant management and their ability\nto continue to drive Mandiant\u2019s business. In this regard, the Mandiant Board was aware that Mr.\nVerdecanna had announced his intention to retire in 2022, and this retirement followed the\ndeparture of other senior executives.\nThe continued business and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the\npossibility that business conditions\u202f-\u202ffor Mandiant and the larger economy\u202f-\u202fwill not improve\nand could get worse.\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of an extensive strategic review\nprocess overseen by the Transaction Committee. The Mandiant Board considered that seven\npotential strategic acquirers (including Parent) and five potential financial acquirers were contacted\nconcerning their interest in an acquisition of Mandiant. The Mandiant Board considered the nature of\nthe engagement by each of these potential acquirers over several weeks, and that only Parent had\nsubmitted an acquisition proposal. The Mandiant Board also was aware of the media reports\nregarding a potential sale of Mandiant that began on February 8, 2022, and noted that, following such\nmedia reports, no additional strategic or financial acquirers contacted Mandiant about pursuing an\nacquisition.\nCertainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists\nentirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business and\nfinancial execution risks of Mandiant\u2019s long-term operating plan. The receipt of cash consideration\neliminates uncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of Mandiant\u2019s\nbusiness plan. In that regard, the Mandiant Board noted that Mandiant\u2019s stock price could be\nnegatively impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations.\nBest Value Reasonably Available\u037e Potential Strategic Alternatives. The Mandiant Board believed\nthat the per share merger consideration represents the best value reasonably available for the shares\nof our common stock, taking into account the other strategic alternatives available to Mandiant,\nincluding continue to execute on our business plan as an independent company. The Mandiant Board\ndetermined that none of the possible alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of\ncontinuing to operate Mandiant as an independent company or pursuing a different transaction, and\nthe desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to\nMandiant\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such\nalternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us to create greater value for\nour stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial,\nindustry, legal, market and regulatory risks. The Mandiant Board also considered that the per share\nmerger consideration constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53 percent to the closing price of our\ncommon stock on February 7, 2022, which was the last full trading day before media reports regarding\na potential sale of Mandiant\u037e and (2) a premium of approximately 57 percent to Mandiant\u2019s unaffected\n10-day volume-weighted average price as of February 7, 2022.\nFairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Mandiant\nBoard, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated March 7, 2022, that,\n48 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nas of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and various\nassumptions made, procedures followed and limitations and qualifications set forth therein, the $23.00\nin cash per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)\nof shares of our common stock, pursuant to the merger agreement, was fair from a financial point of\nview to the holders of such shares The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-",

The following summary, however, does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the\norder of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman\nSachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The\ntables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the\nextent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 4, 2022, and is\nnot necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Premia Analysis\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the $23.00 in cash\nper share of our common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement.\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $23.00 in cash per share of our common\nstock relative to:\n$15.06, the undisturbed closing price for our common stock on February 7, 2022, the last trading day\nprior to media reports regarding a potential sale of Mandiant (the \u201cUndisturbed Share Price\u201d)\u037e\nthe volume weighted average price (which we refer to as \u201cVWAP\u201d) of our common stock over the 5-\ntrading-day time period ended February 7, 2022 (which we refer to as \u201c5-day Undisturbed VWAP\u201d)\u037e\nthe VWAP of our common stock over the 10-trading-day time period ended February 7, 2022 (\u201c10-day\nUndisturbed VWAP\u201d)\u037e and\n$19.38, the closing price for our common stock on March 4, 2022, the last trading day prior to further\nmedia reports regarding the merger (which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d).\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\nCommon Stock Reference Price\nImplied Premium\nRepresented by \n$23.00 in Cash per Share of \nour Common Stock\nUndisturbed Share Price of $15.06\n53\n5-day Undisturbed VWAP\n54\n10-day Undisturbed VWAP\n57\nCurrent Share Price of $19.38\n19\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Mandiant to\nderive a range of illustrative present values per share of Company Stock. Using discount rates ranging from\n9.25 percent to 11.25 percent, reflecting estimates of Mandiant\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, and the\nmid-year convention, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 (1) the estimates\nof unlevered free cash flow (\u201cUFCF\u201d) for Mandiant for the years 2022 through 2035 as reflected in the\nForecasts\u037e and (2) a range of illustrative terminal values for Mandiant, which were calculated by applying\nperpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be\ngenerated by Mandiant, as provided by management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by\nmanagement of Mandiant (which analysis implied exit terminal year NTM EBITDA multiples ranging from 6.9x\nto 12.0x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,\nwhich requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company\u2019s target capital structure weightings,\nthe cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash\ntax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets\ngenerally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional\njudgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real\ngrowth of gross domestic product and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Mandiant by adding the range of present\nvalues it derived as described above and the net present value of the net operating losses as reflected in the\nForecasts, as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of Mandiant. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it\nderived for Mandiant, the net debt (including the amount of the liquidation preference of Mandiant\u2019s\nconvertible preferred stock) of Mandiant as of December 31, 2021, as provided by the management of\nMandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of\nillustrative equity values for Mandiant. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it\nderived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Mandiant (which includes the number of shares\nof common stock, if any, underlying Mandiant\u2019s convertible preferred stock attributable to the portion of the\nvalue of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation preference), as provided by the\nmanagement of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of Mandiant, using the\ntreasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of our common stock ranging\nfrom $13.45 to $21.74.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value\nper share of our common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a\ntheoretical future value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial multiples. For this\nanalysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Goldman Sachs\nfirst calculated the implied enterprise values per share of our common stock as of December 31 for each of\nthe fiscal years 2022 to 2024, by applying multiples of enterprise value to NTM revenue (which is referred to\nas \u201cEV/NTM revenue,\u201d) of 6.0x to 8.0x to estimates of Mandiant\u2019s revenue for each of the fiscal years 2023 to\n2025. These illustrative EV/NTM revenue multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples\nfor Mandiant and current and historical EV/NTM revenue multiples for certain publicly traded companies, as\ndescribed below in the section captioned \u201c- Selected Public Company Comparables Analysis.\u201d\n53 \n%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Mandiant\u2019s forecasted net debt (including the amount of the\nliquidation preference of Mandiant\u2019s convertible preferred stock) as of December 31 for each of the fiscal\nyears 2022 to 2024, each as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use\nby the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Mandiant as of December\n31 for each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of\nprojected year-end fully diluted shares of our common stock (which includes the number of shares of\ncommon stock, if any, underlying Mandiant\u2019s convertible preferred stock attributable to the portion of the\nvalue of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation preference) for each of the fiscal years\n2022 to 2024, as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of Mandiant, to derive a range of implied future share prices. Goldman Sachs then discounted\nthe December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024 implied future share prices back to December 31, 2021 using an\nillustrative discount rate of 9.5 percent to derive implied present values of future share prices as of December\n31, 2021. The illustrative discount rate of 9.5 percent reflected an estimate of Mandiant\u2019s cost of equity.\nGoldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires\ncertain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the\nUnited States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of\n$17.47 to $26.25 per share of our common stock.\nPrecedent Transaction Multiples\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions\nin the security and infrastructure software and high growth IT services industries since 2013. For each of the\nselected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the\nimplied EV/NTM revenue of the applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the\ntransaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s NTM revenue based on Institutional Brokers\u2019 Estimate\nSystem estimates (which are referred to as \u201cIBES estimates\u201d) at the time each such selected transaction was\nannounced. While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly\ncomparable to Mandiant, the companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with\noperations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Mandiant\u2019s results,\nindustry size and product profile.\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nSecurity and Infrastructure Software Selected Precedent Transactions\nAnnouncement \nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEV/NTM \nRevenue\nDec 2021\nMimecast Ltd.\nPermira I.P Limited\n8.8 x\nNov 2021\nMcAfee Corp.\nAdvent International Corp. and Permira \nAdvisers LLC\n6.9 x\nAug 2021\nAvast PLC\u202f-\u202fStock Election\nNortonLifeLock Inc.\n8.8 x\nAug 2021\nAvast PLC\u202f-\u202fCash Election\nNortonLifeLock Inc.\n9.7 x\nApr 2021\nProofpoint Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n9.5 x\nMar 2021\nTalend S.A.\nThoma Bravo\n7 x\nOct 2019\nSophos Ltd.\nThoma Bravo\n4.9 x\nAug 2019\nCarbon Black, Inc.\nVmware, Inc.\n7.7 x\nNov 2018\nApptio Inc.\nVista Equity Partners Management LLC\n6.9 x\nOct 2018\nImperva Inc.\nThoma Bravo\n4.5 x\nSept 2016\nApigee Corp.\nGoogle LLC\n4.5 x\nOct 2015\nSolarWinds, Inc.\nSilver Lake Partners and Thoma Bravo\n7.8 x\nJul 2013\nSourcefire Inc.\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n7.9 x\nMedian\n7.3 x\nMean\n7.7 x\nHigh Growth IT Services Selected Precedent Transactions\nAnnouncement \nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEV/NTM \nRevenue\nMar 2021\nGlobalLogic Worldwide Holdings\nHitachi, Ltd.\n7.9 x\nSep 2020\nVirtusa Corporation\nBaring Private Equity Asia\n1.3 x\nAug 2020\nAareon AG\nAdvent International\n3.7 x\nJun 2019\nAltran Technologies SA\nCapgemini SE\n1.5 x\nJan 2019\nLuxoft Holding, Inc.\nDXC Technology\n2 x\nDec 2017\nGemalto\nThales S.A.\n1.8 x\nAug 2016\nRackspace Technology, Inc.\nApollo Global Management Inc.\n2 x\nApr 2015\nIGATE\nCapgemini SE\n3.1 x\nMedian\n2.9 x\nMean\n2.0 x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses of the various transactions\nand its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs selected a reference range of EV/\u200bNTM revenue\nmultiples of 6.0x to 9.0x and applied such range to Mandiant\u2019s NTM revenue as of December 31, 2021, as\nprovided by the management of Mandiant, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Mandiant.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the amount of Mandiant\u2019s net\ndebt (including the amount of the liquidation preference of Mandiant\u2019s convertible preferred stock) as of\nDecember 31, 2021, as provided by the management Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of Mandiant, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Mandiant. Goldman Sachs\ndivided the results by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (which includes\nthe number of shares of common stock, if any, underlying Mandiant\u2019s convertible preferred stock\nattributable to the portion of the value of the convertible preferred stock in excess of the liquidation\npreference), as provided by the management of Mandiant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of Mandiant, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of implied equity values per\nshare of our common stock of $16.08 to $22.30.\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-\ncash acquisition transactions announced from 2017 through February 14, 2022, involving a public company\nbased in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was between\n$1 billion and $10 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs\ncalculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative\nto the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis\nindicated a median premium of 29 percent across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile\npremium of 17 percent and a 75th percentile premium of 49 percent across the period. Using this analysis,\nGoldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 17% to 49 percent to the unaffected closing\nprice per share of our common stock of $15.06 as of February 7, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity\nvalues per share of our common stock of $17.62 to $22.44.\nSelected Public Company Comparables Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following\npublicly traded corporations in the security and infrastructure software industry, which are collectively\nreferred to as the \u201csecurity comparable companies\u201d:\nCyberark Software Ltd.\u037e\nForgeRock Inc.\u037e\nRapid7 Inc.\u037e\nSailpoint Technologies Holdings Inc.\u037e\nSumo Logic Inc.\u037e\nTenable Holdings Inc.\u037e and\nVaronis Systems Inc.\nGoldman Sachs also reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following\npublicly traded corporations in the high growth IT services industry, which are collectively referred to as the\n\u201cservices comparable companies\u201d:\nEndava PLC\u202f-\u202fADR\u037e\nEPAM Systems Inc.\u037e\nGlobant SA\u037e and\nPerficient, Inc.\nThe security comparable companies and the services comparable companies are collectively referred to as\nthe \u201ccomparable companies.\u201d Although none of the comparable companies is directly comparable to\nMandiant, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies in the security\nand infrastructure software industry and high growth IT services industry, respectively, with operations that\nfor purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Mandiant.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared the enterprise value as of March 4, 2022 as a multiple of revenue for\nthe comparable companies for calendar years 2022 and 2023, based on financial and trading data as of March\n4, 2022, information Goldman Sachs obtained from Thomson Reuters and CapIQ, publicly available historical\nand market data and IBES estimates, in order to determine an appropriate EV/NTM revenue multiple range for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 illustrative present value of future share price analysis.\n56 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe results of this analysis are summarized as follows:\nSecurity Comparable Company\nCY 22\nEV/ \nRevenue\nCY 23\nEV/ \nRevenue\nCyberark Software Ltd.\n9.9x\n8.1x\nForgeRock Inc.\n5.8x\n4.6x\nRapid7 Inc.\n10.3x\n8.4x\nSailpoint Technologies Holdings Inc.\n8.6x\n7.1x\nSumo Logic Inc.\n3.9x\n3.3x\nTenable Holdings Inc.\n9.9x\n8.2x\nVaronis Systems Inc.\n8.7x\n7.2x\nMedian\n8.7x\n7.2x\nServices Comparable Company\nCY 22\nEV/ \nRevenue\nCY 23\nEV/ \nRevenue\nEndava PLC\u202f-\u202fADR\n6.0x\n4.8x\nEPAM Systems Inc.\n2.0x\n1.6x\nGlobant SA\n5.4x\n4.3x\nPerficient, Inc.\n4.3x\n3.7x\nMedian\n4.9x\n4.0x\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all\nof its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,\nGoldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above\nanalyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Mandiant or the contemplated merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the\nMandiant Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the $23.00 price per share to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of our common stock, pursuant to the merger\nagreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which\nbusinesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nsuggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based\nupon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of\nMandiant, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially\ndifferent from those forecast.\nThe merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Mandiant and Parent\nand was approved by the Mandiant Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Mandiant during these\nnegotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to\nMandiant or the Mandiant Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only\nappropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Mandiant Board was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Mandiant Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The\nforegoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman\nSachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written\nopinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.\n57 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,\nsales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and\nservices for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other\nentities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,\nmay at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities,\nderivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of\nMandiant, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Alphabet Inc. (\u201cAlphabet\u201d), an\naffiliate of Parent, and any of its affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, or any currency or\ncommodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs\nacted as financial advisor to Mandiant in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations\nleading to, the transaction contemplated by the agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial\nadvisory and/or underwriting services to Mandiant and its affiliates from time to time for which the\nInvestment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including\nhaving acted as Mandiant\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the sale of its FireEye Products business in\nOctober 2021. During the two year period ended March 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized\ncompensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking\nDivision to Mandiant and/or its affiliates of approximately $20 million. Goldman Sachs also has provided\ncertain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Parent, Alphabet and/or their respective affiliates\nand portfolio companies from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has\nreceived, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Ionic Security Inc., a\nformer portfolio company of Google Ventures, an affiliate of Alphabet, with respect to its sale in April 2021\u037e\nand as financial advisor to Kobalt Music Group Limited, a former portfolio company of Google Ventures, with\nrespect to its sale in May 2021. During the two year period ended March 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs has\nrecognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment\nBanking Division to Parent, Alphabet and/or their respective affiliates and portfolio companies of\napproximately $5 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or\nunderwriting services to Mandiant, Parent, Alphabet and their respective affiliates for which the Investment\nBanking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have\nco-invested with Parent, Alphabet and their respective affiliates from time to time and may do so in the\nfuture.\nGoldman Sachs also acted as bookrunner with respect to the offering by Mandiant of 0.875% Convertible\nSenior Notes due 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, which are referred to as the\n\u201cMandiant convertible notes\u201d and, concurrent with the issuance of the Mandiant convertible notes,\nMandiant entered into capped call transactions with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the\nMandiant convertible notes, which are collectively referred to as the \u201ccapped call transactions,\u201d with\nGoldman Sachs (with respect to 30% of the shares of common stock underlying the Mandiant convertible\nnotes) and other counterparties each acting as principal for its own account, consisting of the purchase by\nMandiant of capped call options with respect to collectively approximately 25,900,020 shares of our common\nstock, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock underlying the Mandiant convertible notes (at\nthe initial conversion rate of 43.1667 shares of our common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of Mandiant\nconvertible notes). The Mandiant convertible notes had an initial strike price equal to $23.17 per share of our\ncommon stock, subject to an initial cap price of $34.32 per share. As of April 20, 2022, 100% of the capped\ncall transactions remain outstanding, with a strike price of approximately $23.17 and a cap price of $34.32.\nThe capped call transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on Mandiant\nstockholders of the conversion of the Mandiant convertible notes and/or any potential cash payment in\nexcess of the principal amount of the Mandiant convertible notes that Mandiant may make in connection\nwith a cash settlement of the Mandiant convertible notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The capped call\ntransactions, upon the exercise thereof, generally require the capped call counterparties to deliver to\nMandiant upon expiration of the call options, a number of shares of our common stock (and/or in certain\ncircumstances, at Mandiant\u2019s election, cash) determined based on the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap\nprice and the price of the shares of our common stock at that time (determined over a period specified in the\ncapped call transactions) over the strike price per share of our common stock.\n58 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe capped call transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with\ntheir terms in connection with certain events. In particular, under the terms of the capped call transactions,\nGoldman Sachs and the other counterparties, each acting separately as calculation agent under the capped\ncall transactions to which it is a party, are entitled in certain circumstances to make adjustments on more than\none occasion to the terms of such capped call transactions to reflect the economic effect of the\nannouncement of such events (including the merger) on the embedded call options. In addition, each of\nGoldman Sachs and the other counterparties may, acting separately as the calculation agent, determining\nparty or otherwise as principal under the capped call transactions to which it is a party, determine such\nadjustments in respect of such capped call transactions in accordance with their terms, including on or\nfollowing consummation or abandonment of such events. All actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman\nSachs, in its capacity as calculation agent, pursuant to the terms of the capped call transactions to which it\nis a party must be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.\nAs a result of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties are expected to have market\nexposure to the price of the shares of our common stock. It is the ordinary practice of the capped call\ncounterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the\nstock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the\ncapped call transactions. In connection with the capped call transactions to which it is a party, Goldman\nSachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in\nhedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various\nderivative transactions with respect to our common stock) that are generally intended to substantially\nneutralize Goldman Sachs\u2019 exposure as a result of the capped call transactions to which it is a party to\nchanges in the price of our common stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs\u2019 own risk and may\nresult in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial expected contractual\nbenefit to Goldman Sachs under the capped call transactions to which it is a party. The amount of any such\ngain or loss will not be known until the applicable capped call transactions have been exercised, expired or\nterminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all of its hedge unwind\nactivities. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional\ninformation barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information\nby personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who are\nundertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs\u2019 capped call transactions.\nTo mitigate the exposure from the capped call transactions, as of April 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs held a net\nlong economic position of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock.\nGoldman Sachs provided to management of Mandiant, for the information of the Mandiant Board, materials\nthat summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the\nconsummation of an acquisition of Mandiant on the capped call transactions. The materials included\npreliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division for a range of stated\nassumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of our common stock and volatilities, as well as based on\nother reasonable assumptions, in the event of an acquisition of Mandiant for greater than 10 percent cash\nconsideration. The materials calculated over a range of potential takeout prices for the shares of our common\nstock ranging from $16.00 per share to $26.00 per share and volatilities (from 25 percent to 35 percent) and for\nan announcement date of March 10, 2022, and other stated assumptions that upon the full unwind of the\ncapped call transactions, Goldman Sachs might realize, after taking into account any estimated hedging gains\nor losses, a net gain or loss ranging from a net loss of approximately $1.8 million to a net gain of\napproximately $4.8 million. In accordance with industry practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary\ninstitutional information barriers reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential\ninformation by personnel in its Investment Banking Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who\nare undertaking hedging and other market transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs\u2019 capped call\ntransactions. In connection with the preparation of presentations to senior management of Mandiant and the\nMandiant Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division, including the representatives of\nGoldman Sachs who have advised Mandiant in connection with the merger, from time to time, have received\nor may receive input from personnel in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Securities Division into how to model, or reports of\nhistorical measures or estimates of, Goldman Sachs\u2019 and/or Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division\u2019s\nprofit and/or loss over certain measurement periods related to the capped call transactions.\n59 \n",

All references in this section to share counts, conversion prices,\ncap prices and strike prices are subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the terms of the\nconfirmations relating to the capped call transactions.\nThe Mandiant Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.\nPursuant to a letter agreement dated September 16, 2019, Mandiant engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its\nfinancial advisor in connection with the contemplated merger. The engagement letter between Mandiant and\nGoldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the\ndate of announcement and assuming that certain Mandiant convertible notes are redeemed prior to the close\nof the transaction per guidance from Mandiant management, at approximately $73 million, all of which is\ncontingent upon consummation of the merger. The transaction fee is subject to upward adjustment by\napproximately $11.5 million in the event that none of the Mandiant convertible notes are redeemed prior to\nthe close of the transaction. In addition, Mandiant has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its\nexpenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons\nagainst various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nProjected Financial Information\nOther than in connection with its regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as\na matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other\nreasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates.\nHowever, Mandiant management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for\ninternal use.\nIn connection with our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives, Mandiant\nmanagement prepared and provided to the Mandiant Board various unaudited forward-looking financial\ninformation for fiscal years 2022 through 2035. This forward-looking information is collectively referred to as\nthe \u201cProjected Financial Information.\u201d The Projected Financial Information was approved by Mandiant for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use for purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its\nfairness opinion to the Mandiant Board (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c- Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d). A summary of the Projected Financial Information is set\nforth below.\nThe Projected Financial Information was developed by Mandiant management without giving effect to the\nmerger or to any changes to Mandiant\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the\nconsummation of the merger. The Projected Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any\nfailure of the merger to be completed\u037e it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d). In\naddition, the Projected Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the\nguidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to\nprospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other\nindependent accountants have (1) compiled, reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with\nrespect to the Projected Financial Information\u037e (2) expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on\nsuch information or the achievability of the Projected Financial Information\u037e or (3) assumed any\nresponsibility for the Projected Financial Information. Our independent registered public accounting firm\ndisclaims any association with the Projected Financial Information.\nThe Projected Financial Information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Mandiant management. In\npreparing the Projected Financial Information, Mandiant management utilized the following material\nassumptions:\nAn accelerated revenue growth rate of approximately 15 percent to 50 percent in years 2022 through\n2025 in our Platform, Cloud Subscriptions and Managed Services business as the Mandiant\nAdvantage platform achieves maturity and is consequently sold into Mandiant\u2019s customer base\u037e\n60 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnual recurring revenue and compound annual growth rate of greater than 30 percent from 2022\nthrough 2025\u037e\nGrowth of 15 percent to 23 percent in the Professional Services business consistent with our\nhistorical experience of growth of approximately 20 percent per year, with future growth of 15 percent\nto 23 percent further influenced by the following: (1) Mandiant\u2019s ability to retain consultants at\nsimilar rates to historical trends in an increasingly competitive environment\u037e (2) Mandiant\u2019s ability to\ngrow revenue internationally at an accelerated pace of over 20 percent per year given the continued\ninvestments required to build the Mandiant brand internationally\u037e and (3) increasing utilization rates\nby approximately 3 percent to 5 percent over the historical utilization rates between 55 percent and 60\npercent for Mandiant consulting driven by increased deferred revenue in our Professional Services\nbusiness and the ability to deliver services remotely from anywhere in the world\u037e\nImproved non-GAAP operating margins moving from double digit negative operating margins to\nexiting 2025 with operating margins above 20 percent due to revenues increasing on average over 20\npercent per year through 2025, a greater rate than the increase in operating expenses of between 5\npercent to 18 percent per year through 2025, which also assumes the provision by us of certain\ntransition services to the buyer in connection with the divestiture of the FireEye Products business\u037e\nand\nNo material acquisitions or divestitures by Mandiant.\nMandiant management, using its business judgment, believed in good faith the above assumptions were\nreasonable and, as a result of this belief, the opinion of Mandiant management was that the Projected\nFinancial Information (1) was prepared on a reasonable basis\u037e (2) reflected the best estimates and judgments\nthen available (taking into account the relevant information available to Mandiant management at that time)\u037e\nand (3) presented, to Mandiant management\u2019s knowledge, our expected future financial performance within\nthe parameters and under the assumptions specified in preparing the Projected Financial Information.\nBecause the Projected Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to\nsensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business\ndevelopments. The Projected Financial Information also covers multiple years, and such information by its\nnature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Projected Financial Information is not, and\nshould not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Projected Financial\nInformation is not fact, is subjective in many respects, and should not be relied upon as being necessarily\nindicative of Mandiant\u2019s future results.\nAlthough the Projected Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous\nassumptions and estimates as to future events, including those detailed above, made by Mandiant\nmanagement that Mandiant management believed in good faith were reasonable. Our ability to achieve the\nfinancial results contemplated by the Projected Financial Information will be affected by our ability to\nachieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Projected Financial\nInformation reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important\nfactors that may affect actual results and cause the Projected Financial Information not to be achieved\ninclude, among others, (1) general economic conditions (including the impact of COVID-19 and COVID-19\nmeasures)\u037e (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions\u037e (3) changes in actual or projected cash\nflows\u037e (4) changes in tax laws\u037e (5) competitive pressures, including new market entrants and changes in the\ncompetitive environment\u037e (6) customer demand for our products and services\u037e (7) our ability to attract,\nintegrate and retain qualified personnel\u037e (8) our ability to develop new services and product features\u037e and (9)\nour ability to implement various business transformation initiatives, including a new enterprise resource\nplanning system to improve our cost structure. Additional factors that may impact us or our business can be\nfound in the various risk factors included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult\nto predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the\nProjected Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than\nthose contained in the Projected Financial Information. The Projected Financial Information may differ from\npublicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date\nthat it was prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the merger agreement. You should\nevaluate the Projected Financial Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial statements\nand other information regarding Mandiant contained in our public filings with the SEC. The Projected\nFinancial\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInformation may not be consistent with Mandiant\u2019s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions\ndetailed above and due to the material changes in our business as a result of and following the divestiture of\nthe FireEye Products business. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not\nintend to update or otherwise revise the Projected Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing\nafter the date that such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.\nCertain of the financial measures included in the Projected Financial Information are \u201cnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures.\u201d These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and\nmay be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are\nlimitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are\nrequired to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nFinancial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in\nconnection with a business combination transaction, such as the Projected Financial Information, are\nexcluded from the definition of \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nAs a result, the Projected Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-\nGAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure\nto a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied\nupon by the Mandiant Board or Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures\nincluded in the Projected Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.\nThe Projected Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. For information on factors that\nmay cause Mandiant\u2019s future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nForward Looking Statements\u201d. By including the Projected Financial Information in this proxy statement,\nneither we nor any of our advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any\nperson regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Projected\nFinancial Information. The inclusion of the Projected Financial Information should not be regarded as an\nindication that the Mandiant Board, Mandiant or any other recipient of the Projected Financial Information\nconsidered, or now considers, the Projected Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results.\nFurther, the inclusion of the Projected Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an\nadmission or representation by Mandiant that the information presented is material. The Projected Financial\nInformation is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that\nwas made available to the Mandiant Board and Goldman Sachs for purposes of performing its financial\nanalyses in connection with rendering its fairness opinion to the Mandiant Board (as described in more\ndetail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c- Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\u201d). The\nProjected Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement for the purpose of influencing any\nMandiant stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not\nto seek appraisal rights with respect to such stockholder\u2019s shares.\nCertain of the Projected Financial Information was also provided to Parent.\nThe following table summarizes the Projected Financial Information.\nFiscal year ending December 31,\n(dollars in millions)\n2022E 2023E 2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\n2031E\n2032E\n2033E\n2034E\n2035E\nRevenue\n$ 575 $ 759 $ 949 $1,178 $1,425 $1,674\n$1,906\n$2,099\n$2,229\n$2,361\n$2,494\n$2,627\n$2,757\n$2,885\nGross profit\n362\n515\n673\n867\n1,057\n1,251\n1,432\n1,583\n1,689\n1,796\n1,904\n2,011\n2,117\n2,221\nResearch and development\n(140\n(155\n(164\n(178\n(181\n(184\n(191\n(210\n(223\n(236\n(249\n(263\n(276\n(289\nSales and marketing\n(222\n(272\n(321\n(383\n(451\n(514\n(568\n(607\n(624\n(661\n(698\n(735\n(772\n(808\nGeneral and administrative\n(66\n(78\n(80\n(89\n(109\n(129\n(148\n(165\n(176\n(187\n(197\n(207\n(218\n(228\nEBIT (excluding stock-\nbased compensation\nexpense)\n(65\n10\n107\n217\n316\n423\n525\n602\n665\n712\n759\n806\n852\n896\nNormalized Depreciation\n17\n18\n18\n19\n24\n29\n35\n40\n45\n51\n57\n64\n72\n70\n62 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n (1)\n)\n",

The voting agreement obligates Mr. Mandia to vote certain of his shares of our common stock in\nfavor of the adoption of the merger agreement and against any competing transaction. For more information,\nplease see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger - The Voting Agreements.\u201d In (1)\nevaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and\n(3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Mandiant Board was aware\nof and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)\nwill be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.\nEach unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an\namount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess of the per share price over the\nexercise or purchase price per share, if any, of such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit and (2) the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock then-subject to such unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit. Such\ncash amount will (1) vest and become payable (less any required withholding and other taxes) in accordance\nwith the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding unvested Mandiant restricted stock unit\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to such holder\u2019s continued service with Parent\nand its affiliates through the applicable vesting dates, and (2) be subject to the terms and conditions of the\nunvested payment plan.\nAll other Mandiant restricted stock units not described above that are outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time of the merger will be canceled for no consideration.\nTreatment of Mandiant Performance-Based Awards\nEach completed Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,\nwithout interest, equal to the completed Mandiant PSU consideration with such completed Mandiant PSU\nconsideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting schedule applicable to such completed\nMandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and subject to the terms of the unvested\npayment plan.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each uncompleted Mandiant PSU will be canceled and converted into a\nright to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration\nwith such uncompleted Mandiant PSU consideration vesting in accordance with the service-based vesting\nschedule applicable to such uncompleted Mandiant PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger\nand subject to the terms of the unvested payment plan.\nTreatment of Mandiant Options\nAs of April 6, 2022, there were outstanding Mandiant options to purchase an aggregate of 1,560,830 shares\nof our common stock (with a weighted average exercise price of $7.5101), of which none were held by our\ncurrent non-employee directors or current executive officers.\nEach Mandiant option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of the\nmerger will accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in\ncash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise\nprice per share of such Mandiant option, and (2) the number of shares of our common stock then issuable\nupon exercise in full of such Mandiant option. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes)\nwill be paid to the applicable holder promptly following the effective time of the merger.\nAny Mandiant option, whether vested or unvested, with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater\nthan the per share price will be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.\nTreatment of the ESPP\nPrior to the effective time of the merger Mandiant will take all action necessary to cause any offering period\nor purchase period under the ESPP that is outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement to be\nterminated no later than ten business days prior to the date of the closing of the merger. We will also make\nany adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase\nperiod. Mandiant will cause the exercise (as of no later than ten business days prior to the closing date of\nthe merger) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such exercise date, Mandiant will\napply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant\u2019s account to the\npurchase of whole shares of Mandiant common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

The payments and benefits in the Severance Policy vary based on whether an eligible employee is an\nofficer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as a \u201cTier 1 Executive,\u201d) or is not an\nofficer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as a \u201cTier II Executive.\u201d).\nIn the event of a qualified termination of employment, during the change of control period, an eligible\nemployee will receive the following:\nTier I Executive or Tier II Executive:\nlump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months\u2019 base salary\u037e\n66 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlump-sum cash payment equal to a pro-rata target bonus for the year of termination\u037e\n100% acceleration of all then-unvested equity awards with unvested performance awards vesting\nat maximum level\u037e and\npaid COBRA continuation for 12 months.\nIn the event of a termination of employment without \u201ccause\u201d  (as generally defined below) outside of the\nchange of control period, an eligible employee will receive the following:\nTier I Executive:\nlump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months\u2019 base salary\u037e and\npaid COBRA continuation for 12 months.\nTier II Executive:\nlump-sum cash payment equal to six months\u2019 base salary\u037e and\npaid COBRA continuation for six months.\nAll severance payments and benefits under the Severance Policy are subject to the eligible employee\nexecuting and not revoking a general release of clams in favor of Mandiant. Payments and benefits under the\nSeverance Policy replace any then-existing severance and/or change of control payment and benefit\narrangements that an eligible employee had previously been entitled to receive.

This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC\ndisclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable\nto Mandiant\u2019s named executive officers. Mandiant\u2019s \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d for purposes of the\ndisclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Bailey, Mandia, Robbins, Verdecanna and Watters and Ms.\nKing.

Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a\nnamed executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.\nMandiant\u2019s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax\nreimbursements in connection with the merger. In addition, the estimated amounts below do not attempt to\nquantify any reduction that may be required as a result of any cutback under Section 280G of the Code.

Unless the context requires otherwise, all\nreferences in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or to a \u201cholder of shares\u201d are to a record\nholder of our common stock.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the\nDGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement\nas Annex B and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is\nentitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial\ninterest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker\nor other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder\u2019s\nshares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal\nrights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262, which is attached here as\nAnnex B, as well as the information discussed below. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding\nand perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) do\nnot vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) continuously are the record\nholders of such shares through the effective time of the merger\u037e (3) submit a written demand for appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares to Mandiant prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (4)\notherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262\u037e and\n(5) do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares or otherwise lose their rights to\nappraisal, in each case in accordance with Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares of our common\nstock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the \u201cfair value\u201d of\ntheir shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines\notherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to\nbe the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However,\nafter an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine\nstockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who\nasserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock for which appraisal\nrights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock\nas measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (2) the value of the merger consideration in\nrespect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the\n70 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment\nto each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference,\nif any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under\nno obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined\npursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they\nwould receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,\nthe corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as\nof the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a\ncopy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Mandiant\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal\nrights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex B. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who wishes\nto exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex B\ncarefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights\nwill be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek\nappraisal of shares of our common stock, Mandiant believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising\nsuch rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do\nALL of the following:\nthe stockholder must not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement\u037e\nthe stockholder must deliver to Mandiant a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting\u037e\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the\nshares before the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\na stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in\na voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a\npetition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the shares of\nall such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation\nis under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to\ndetermine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our\nstockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 is\nmet.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, each of our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting with respect\nto such proposal.\nFiling Written Demand\nA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Mandiant, before the vote on the adoption\nof the merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s\nshares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption\n71 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special\nmeeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your\nappraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for\nappraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of\nthe merger. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder and state that the person\nintends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger. A proxy that is\nsubmitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify\nany previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and\nwho wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the\nadoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither\nvoting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the\nproposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal\nsatisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the\nadoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written\ndemand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will\nconstitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Mandiant of the identity of the\nholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the\nshares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or\ncustodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned\nof record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or\nmore joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent\nmust identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is\nacting as agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder, such as a broker who holds shares of\nMandiant\u2019s common stock as nominee for several beneficial owners, may exercise appraisal rights with\nrespect to the shares of Mandiant\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime of the merger held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the\nshares of Mandiant\u2019s common stock held for other beneficial owners\u037e in such case, however, the written\ndemand should set forth the number of shares of Mandiant\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the merger as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of\nshares of common stock is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of\nMandiant\u2019s common stock which are held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their\nshares of Mandiant\u2019s common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise\nappraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the\nmaking of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.\nA beneficial owner of shares of Mandiant\u2019s common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who desires appraisal\nshould take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is\nmade by the record holder of such shares. Shares of Mandiant common stock held through brokerage firms,\nbanks and other financial institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a\nnominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co. Any beneficial holder desiring appraisal who\nholds shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the\ndemand for appraisal is made by the record holder. The beneficial holder of such shares should instruct such\nfirm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal be made by the record holder of the shares, which may\nbe the nominee of a central security depository if the shares have been so deposited.\nONLY A HOLDER OF RECORD OF SHARES OF MANDIANT\u2019S COMMON STOCK IS ENTITLED TO\nDEMAND APPRAISAL RIGHTS FOR THE SHARES REGISTERED IN THAT HOLDER\u2019S NAME.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR \u201cSTREET NAME\u201d BY A BANK,\nBROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO\n72 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR\nOTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF\nANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY\nTO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS\nNECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nMandiant, Inc. \n11951 Freedom Drive, 6th Floor \nReston, VA 20190 \nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock\nmay withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the\nmerger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Mandiant, as\nthe surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to\nwithdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written\napproval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective\ntime of the merger. If Mandiant, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a\ndemand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who\nwithdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding\nsentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with\nrespect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in\nany such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price\nbeing offered pursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will\nnotify each record holder of shares of our common stock who has properly made a written demand for\nappraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement,\nthat the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any\nholder of shares of our common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a\npetition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a\npetition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all\ndissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no\npresent intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will\nfile a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should\ninitiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the\nperiod specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has\ncomplied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be\n73 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nentitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the\naggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to\nwhich Mandiant has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares.\nThe surviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after\nreceipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares\nof our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is\nserved upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after\nsuch service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to\nthe value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of\nthe time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the\nstockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given\nby one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general\ncirculation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court\nof Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\nAfter notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who\nhave become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\nstockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in\nChancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to\ncomply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nstockholder.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert\nappraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and\nperfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as measured in accordance\nwith subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for\nwhich appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, and\nthat at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking\nappraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through\nsuch proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our\ncommon stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nmerger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the\nDelaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\neffective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and\nwill accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established\nfrom time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the\njudgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of\nChancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder\nseeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h)\nof Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash\npayment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the\n74 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfactors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of\nvalue by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community\nand otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201cfair price obviously requires\nconsideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated\nthat, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends,\nearnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date\nof the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that\nfair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nmerger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a\n\u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are\nknown or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the\nconsideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and\nthat an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262. Although Mandiant believes that the per share price is fair, no representation is made as to the\noutcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should\nrecognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nper share price. Neither Mandiant nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any\nstockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Mandiant and Parent reserves the rights to make a\nvoluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the\nper share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above\nhas been satisfied in respect of our stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will\ncease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses\nof experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any\nstockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s\nfees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to\nan appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262\nfails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of\nour common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to\nreceive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of our\nstockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of such holder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the\nmerger agreement in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in\ncompliance with Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions\npayable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger)\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if\nsuch stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand\nfor an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger\nor thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an\nappraisal will cease.

In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting\nshares in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nConsequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel\nbefore attempting to exercise those rights.\nAccounting Treatment\nThe merger will be accounted for as a \u201cpurchase transaction\u201d for financial accounting purposes.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that\nmay be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common\nstock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is\nbased upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d) Treasury Regulations\npromulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we\nrefer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and\nall of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This\ndiscussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be\nrelevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations,\npartnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and\nsecurities\u037e traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their\nsecurities\u037e regulated investment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S.\nanti-inversion rules\u037e holders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d for\npurposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code\u037e Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by\nattribution) more than five percent of our common stock\u037e or certain former citizens or long-term\nresidents of the United States\u037e\ntax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,\nstraddle or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory\ntransaction or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or\nother entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross\nincome with respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable\nfinancial statement\u201d  (as defined in the Code)\u037e\nthe U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any\u037e\n76 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nany state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\ntax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand\nappraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a\npartner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the\npartner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that\na holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX\nLAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the\ncontrol of one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has\na valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States\nperson.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will\nbe a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will\nbe equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will\nequal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one\nyear at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to\nlong-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at\ndifferent times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period\nseparately with respect to each block of our common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our\ncommon stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain\ngenerally will\n77 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S.\nHolder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent\n(or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other conditions are met, in which case such\ngain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an\napplicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\nMandiant is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined\nin Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the\nfive-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the\napplicable shares of our common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of\nour common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of\nSection 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively)\nmore than five percent of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case\nsuch gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as\ndescribed in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a\ncorporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the\nCode) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property\ninterests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real\nproperty interests generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although\nthere can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC\nat any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds\nreceived by a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder\nthat furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a)\nprovides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8\n(or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will\nbe allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S.\nfederal income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts\nrelating to the merger.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued\nthereunder (which we refer to as \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain\npayments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d  (as specially defined under these rules) unless such\ninstitution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect\nand provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such\ninstitution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account\nholders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose\na U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless\nsuch entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners\nof the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an\napplicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder\nmight be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\n78 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe U.S. Treasury Department released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would\neliminate the federal withholding tax of 30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other\ndisposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department\nstated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible\nimplications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral Efforts\nUnder the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and Mandiant agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take\nall actions and do all things necessary, proper or, in the good faith discretion of Parent, advisable, pursuant\nto applicable law or otherwise to consummate the merger and the conversion of the convertible preferred\nstock by no later than the termination date (as it may be extended in accordance with the merger agreement).\nHSR Act\u037e Competition Laws\u037e Foreign Investment Laws\nUnder the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and Mandiant file a Notification and Report\nForm with the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d) and the applicable waiting period\nhas expired or been terminated. The parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on\nMarch 21, 2022. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-\ncalendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the\nearly termination of that waiting period. On April 20, 2022, Mandiant and Parent each received a Second\nRequest from the DOJ in connection with the DOJ\u2019s review of the merger. The issuance of the Second\nRequest extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both Mandiant and Parent have\nsubstantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the DOJ or\nextended by agreement of Mandiant and Parent.\nMandiant and Parent have each agreed to (1) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause\nthe other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by\nthe FTC, the DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any antitrust\nand FDI filing is made\u037e and (2) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to, as\nsoon as practicable, (a) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the\nHSR Act and any other antitrust and FDI laws applicable to the merger and/or the conversion of the\nconvertible preferred stock by the termination date (as it may be extended in accordance with the merger\nagreement) and (b) obtain any required consents pursuant to any antitrust and FDI laws applicable to the\nmerger and/or the conversion of the convertible preferred stock by the termination date (as it may be\nextended in accordance with the merger agreement).\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of\nsubstantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and\nnotwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action\nunder its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Mandiant or Parent. Private parties\nmay also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nAntitrust and FDI approvals of the merger are required in various jurisdictions throughout Europe, the\nMiddle East and Asia. As of the date of this proxy statement, Mandiant and Parent have determined to make\nantitrust notifications in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Taiwan and Turkey, and may make notifications in other\njurisdictions. One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification,\nrequirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties\nmay also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals,\nwhich actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the\nmerger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are\nqualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to\ncarefully read and consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger,\nand in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement\nthat is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger\nagreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger\nagreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made\nsolely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications,\nlimitations and supplemental information agreed to by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub in connection\nwith negotiating the terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard\nof materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in\nsome cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Mandiant in\nconnection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been\nincluded in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Mandiant and\nParent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of\nmateriality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the\nrepresentations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger\nif the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance\nor otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and\nshould not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof\nas characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Mandiant, Parent or Merger Sub or any of\ntheir respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the\nrepresentations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no\nlegal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not\nrely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of\nMandiant, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly\npermitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the\nappropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Mandiant, Parent, Merger\nSub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other\nagreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information\nprovided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Mandiant and our\nbusiness.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini\nGoodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304 (or\nremotely via the electronic exchange of documents), on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than\nthe fourth business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement)\nof the last to be satisfied or waived of the closing conditions of the merger (described in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Merger\u201d), other than\nconditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction\nor waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time, location and date mutually agreed to in\nwriting by Mandiant, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will file a\ncertificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The\nmerger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of such certificate of merger, or at a later time\nagreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.\n85 ",

Mandiant will be required to make an offer to repurchase each series of Convertible Notes\nat 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable\nfundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the applicable convertible notes indenture). The Series A\n2035 Notes are also redeemable at the option of Mandiant, and after June 1, 2022, the Series B 2035 Notes will\nbe redeemable at the option of Mandiant, in each case at 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued\nand unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (as defined in the applicable\nconvertible notes indenture). Under the merger agreement, Mandiant has agreed to cooperate with Parent in\nthe event that Parent seeks to launch a tender offer with respect to any or all of the Convertible Notes.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, Mandiant entered into capped call transactions with\ncertain option counterparties. The capped call transactions were expected by Mandiant to reduce the\npotential dilution to Mandiant\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or to offset any\ncash payments that Mandiant would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted\n2024 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap set forth in the capped\ncall transactions. In order to hedge the risks of the option counterparties under or in respect of the capped\ncall transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates from time to time enter into or unwind\nvarious derivative transactions with respect to Mandiant\u2019s common stock and/or purchase or sell\nMandiant\u2019s common stock or other securities issued by Mandiant in secondary market transactions.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, Parent has the right to direct Mandiant to effect an early termination and\ncash settlement of all obligations in respect of the capped call transactions.

The prepaid\nshare forward transaction entered into in connection with the issuance of the Series A 2035 Notes was fully\nsettled on June 3, 2020. The prepaid share forward transaction entered into in connection with the issuance\nof the Series B 2035 Notes was intended by Mandiant to facilitate privately negotiated derivative\ntransactions pursuant to which investors in the Series B 2035 Notes are able to hedge their investment in the\nSeries B 2035 Notes. It is scheduled to settle on or about June 1, 2022.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, Mandiant has agreed that, except for the settlement on June 1, 2022 of the\nprepaid share forward transaction in accordance with its terms, Mandiant will not exercise any option or\nmake any election under, or amend, modify, supplement, negotiate any adjustment to or obtain any waiver of,\nor novate, accelerate, liquidate, terminate early, cancel or otherwise settle, such prepaid share forward\ntransaction.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nThe merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will honor and fulfill, in all\nrespects, the obligations of Mandiant and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements\nbetween Mandiant and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former\ndirectors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Mandiant or any of its subsidiaries\nprior to the effective time of the merger), on the other hand (we refer to such persons collectively as the\n\u201cindemnified persons\u201d) to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition, under the merger agreement,\nduring the period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the\neffective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the\nsurviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other\nsimilar organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with\nrespect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the\nindemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws\nand the other similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Mandiant, as\n103 ",

If the certificate of\nincorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in\nsubsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\n(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to\nbe submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to\nthe meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such\nmeeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that\nappraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall\ninclude in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock\ncorporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such\nstockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or\nconsolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may\nbe delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing\nsystem (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it\nreasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends\nthereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or\nconsolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so\nby a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger\nor consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each\nconstituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or\nconsented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become\neffective\u037e or\n(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title,\nthen either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the\nsurviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class\nor series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of\nthe merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or\nseries of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section\nand, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such\nnotice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify\nsuch stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to\nappraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger\napproved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer\ncontemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing\nfrom the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a\ndemand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be\nsufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the\nstockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not\nnotify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent\ncorporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying\neach of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to\nappraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting\ncorporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective\ndate\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of\nthe first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later\nof the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the\nsending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to\nappraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this\nsubsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the\ncorporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of\nfraud, be\nB-2 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to\nreceive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not\nmore than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after\nthe effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no\nrecord date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close\nof business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and\nwho is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in\nthe Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding\nas a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this\nsection hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled\nto receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting\nforth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a\nmerger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded\nstock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and\naccepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to\nwhich demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such\nstatement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a\nstatement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value\nof their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed\nby the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The\nRegister in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing\nof such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the\nstockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in\nthe City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices\nby mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation.\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have\ndemanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class\nor series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who\nare otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger\nwas approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\nB-3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or\nconsolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its\ndiscretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest\nfrom the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded\nquarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of\npayment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving\ncorporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall\naccrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so\npaid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled\nto participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal\nprior to the fmal determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name\nappears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section\nand who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is\nrequired, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is fmally determined that such stockholder is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each\nsuch stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares\nrepresented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.\nThe Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether\nsuch surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion\nof the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided\nin subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation\na written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or\nconsolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in\nsubsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of\nsuch stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the\nCourt of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this\nprovision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-4 \n",

The Certificate so surrendered will be\ncancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms\nand conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in\naccordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of\nany holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates\npursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and\nafter the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect\nthereof pursuant to Section 2.7.\n(ii) Uncertificated Shares.
