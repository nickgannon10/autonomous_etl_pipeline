        "Section Text": "The Special Meeting (page 31)\nDate, Time and Place of the Special Meeting\nThis Proxy Statement is being furnished to the stockholders of Veoneer (the \u201cVeoneer Stockholders\u201d) as a part of the\nsolicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting of stockholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d) to be held\non December 16, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Due to public health\nconcerns surrounding COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and well-being of Veoneer\u2019s employees, stockholders\nand other community members, Veoneer will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual format only at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting in person.\nPurpose of the Special Meeting\nAt the Special Meeting, Veoneer Stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals (collectively, the\n\u201cSpecial Meeting Proposals\u201d) to:\n\u2022\nadopt the Merger Agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\napprove, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nRecord Date\u037e Shares Entitled to Vote\u037e Quorum\nOnly Veoneer Stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2021 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d), are\nentitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement\nthereof. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Veoneer\u2019s\nheadquarters located at Klarabergsviadukten 70, Section C6, Box 13089, SE- 103 02, Stockholm, Sweden, during\nregular business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and online at the meeting\nwebsite during the Special Meeting. To access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting\nwebsite link set forth here: www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VNE2021SM.\nThe inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the\nSpecial Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. In order to constitute a\nquorum for the conduct of business at the Special Meeting, a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer\u2019s\ncommon stock, par value $1.00 per share (\u201cVeoneer Common Stock\u201d), entitled to vote at the Special Meeting must be\npresent or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be\ntreated as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum is present.\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nVote Required\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is\nrequired to adopt the Merger Agreement. Holders of Veoneer\u2019s Swedish Depository Receipts (\u201cSDRs\u201d) are entitled to\nvote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they directly held Veoneer Common Stock.\nTherefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR\nheld on the Record Date. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Veoneer Common\nStock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum\nis present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This\nmeans that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than fifty percent (50%) of\nthe total number of outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nAbstentions will be counted as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve compensation that will or\nmay become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both\nproposals presented to Veoneer Stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, a bank, broker or other nominee\nthat holds shares in street name for a beneficial owner may not, under applicable rules, vote those shares without\nspecific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If the beneficial owner does not provide instructions on either\nproposal, then the bank, broker or other nominee will not be entitled to vote the shares at the Special Meeting and, as\na result, those shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner provides\ninstruction as to how the bank, broker or other nominee should vote on one proposal, but does not provide any\ninstruction regarding how to vote on the other proposal, then the shares will be deemed present at the Special\nMeeting, the bank, broker or other nominee will vote the shares as instructed on the proposal for which it received\ninstruction, and the bank, broker or other nominee will not vote the shares on the other proposal, which is known as a\n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d on that proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nShares Held by Veoneer\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\nAt the close of business on the Record Date, Veoneer\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially owned 420,551\nshares of Veoneer Common Stock (including their vested Veoneer stock options), which represented approximately\n0.4% of the shares of outstanding Veoneer Common Stock on that date (and approximately 0.4% of the outstanding\nshares of Veoneer Common Stock when taking into account Veoneer stock options (the \u201cCompany Options\u201d)). The\ndirectors and executive officers have informed Veoneer that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Veoneer\nCommon Stock \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement and \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding, advisory proposal\nregarding compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection\nwith the Merger.\nVoting of Proxies\nIf your shares are registered in your name with Veoneer\u2019s transfer agent, Computershare, you may cause your shares\nto be voted by submitting, electronically over the internet or by phone, a proxy authorizing the voting of your shares\nby following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the\ninstructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. We\nencourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a\ntouch-tone phone or the internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid\nenvelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your\nshares according to your directions.\nIf you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a virtual\nballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held of record by a broker,\nbank or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, your vote by\nvirtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued in your name from\nyour broker, bank or other nominee.\nVoting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies\nreceived in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will\nor may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. No proxy that is\nspecifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in favor of the proposed compensation\narrangements for Veoneer\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, unless it is specifically marked\n\u201cFOR\u201d the approval of such proposal.\nIf your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are \u201cnon-routine matters,\u201d\nyour broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special\nMeeting Proposals. If your shares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other\nnominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to authorize your\nbroker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares \u201cFOR\u201d both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the\ninstructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the internet or telephone through your\nbroker, bank or other nominee or do not return your bank\u2019s, broker\u2019s or other nominee\u2019s voting form, or do not attend\nthe Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, it will be counted as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to approve,\nby non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger. If you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares\non one proposal, but do not provide instructions as to the other proposal, your shares will be voted as instructed on\nthe one proposal and a broker non-vote will occur on the other proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same effect\nas a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to\napprove, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger.\nHolders of Veoneer\u2019s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if they\ndirectly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of Veoneer\nCommon Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the meeting to\nensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear\nSweden AB (\u201cEuroclear\u201d) or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to\nvote over the internet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR\nholders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes\nfrom their clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set\nforth in the proxy materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to contact\nyour broker to vote.\nYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote electronically.\nPlease submit your proxy via the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If\nyou do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and\nreturning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special\nMeeting in a virtual format. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy\nholders will vote your shares as you have directed.\nThe Magna Merger Agreement has been terminated and the proposed merger with Magna has been abandoned.\nTherefore, the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders to adopt the Magna Merger Agreement was cancelled and\nany proxy given to vote at that special meeting will not be counted at the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger\nAgreement with Qualcomm and SSW or at all. Failure to return or submit your proxy or vote at the Special Meeting in\naccordance with the instructions provided in this Proxy Statement will have the effect of voting your shares\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nAll shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the internet,\nby telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or\nsuperseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no\ndirection is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy\ncard according to the recommendation of the board of directors of Veoneer (the \u201cBoard\u201d) \u201cFOR\u201d both of the Special\nMeeting Proposals.\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecord Date\nThe Record Date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting\nis November 12, 2021. Only Veoneer Stockholders who held shares of Veoneer Common Stock of record at the close of\nbusiness on November 12, 2021, are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment or postponement of\nthe Special Meeting.\nQuorum\nA quorum is necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting. A quorum requires the presence at the Special\nMeeting of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote generally at the meeting\nconsidered at the Special Meeting, via the Veoneer meeting website or represented by proxy.\nFor purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present will count towards the quorum,\nwhich will include proxies received but marked as abstentions. Because both proposals presented to stockholders\nwill be considered non-discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial\nowner will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions regarding\nhow those shares should be voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special Meeting and\nnot count for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides voting\ninstructions on either or both proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such shares as\ninstructed and they will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum.",

Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08869 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e\nWhitfield v. Veoneer, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09177 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e Anderson v.

The complaints each allege\nthat the preliminary Proxy Statement issued in connection with the proposed Merger between Veoneer and Qualcomm\nomitted material information which rendered the preliminary Proxy Statement incomplete and misleading. Specifically,\nthe complaints allege that the preliminary Proxy Statement failed to disclose material information regarding Veoneer\u2019s\nfinancial projections, Rothschild\u2019s and Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analyses, and additional information regarding\nprior work Morgan Stanley performed for Veoneer and Qualcomm.\nEach complaint seeks, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction unless and until additional disclosures\nare issued\u037e and, if the Merger closes, damages. The defendants believe the complaints are without merit. It is possible\nadditional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this Proxy Statement and consummation of the Merger.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Veoneer, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ngovernmental authority in the U.S. or other specified foreign jurisdictions shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,\nenforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering\nillegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an\ninjunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent\nthe Merger from being consummated, or from being consummated within the expected time frame.\n10TABLE OF CONTENTS",

The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of\ndoing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should\nnot return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not\nvote its shares. Only a holder of record of shares of Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for\nthe shares registered in that holder\u2019s name.

Concurrently with the\ntermination of the Magna Merger Agreement and pursuant thereto, Qualcomm paid to Magna the $110,000,000\nTermination Fee in satisfaction of Veoneer\u2019s obligations under the Magna Merger Agreement.\nOn October 4, 2021, following termination of the Merger Agreement, Veoneer entered into the Merger Agreement\nfollowing a determination by the Board that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d) constituted a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Background of the Merger\u201d).\n20TABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor more information regarding the background of the merger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Background\nof the Merger\u201d beginning on page 39 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nI have already given my proxy to vote my shares at the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders in connection\nwith the approval of the Magna Merger Agreement. Do I need to give my proxy or vote my shares again?\nA:\nYes. The Magna Merger Agreement has been terminated and the proposed merger with Magna has been\nabandoned. Therefore, the special meeting of Veoneer Stockholders to adopt the Magna Merger Agreement was\ncancelled and any proxy given to vote at that special meeting will not be counted at the Special Meeting to\nadopt the Merger Agreement with Qualcomm and SSW or at all. Failure to return or submit your proxy or vote at\nthe Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement will have the effect of\nvoting your shares \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders and holders of SDRs to vote\nelectronically.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Veoneer?\nA:\nThe proposed Merger is the acquisition of Veoneer by the Acquiring Parties through the Merger of Merger Sub\nwith and into Veoneer pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is\napproved by the requisite number of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under\nthe Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Veoneer, with Veoneer\ncontinuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Veoneer will become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of SSW and you will no longer own shares of Veoneer Common Stock. Veoneer expects to delist its\nsecurities from the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm and de-register its Veoneer Common Stock under the Exchange\nAct as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Veoneer would no longer be a publicly traded\ncompany, and Veoneer will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nUpon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $37.00 in\ncash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Veoneer Common Stock that\nyou own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL\nwith respect to such shares. For example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Veoneer Common Stock, you\nwill be entitled to receive $3,700.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in\nexchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Veoneer Common Stock. In either case, your shares will be\ncanceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the Surviving Corporation or the Acquiring\nParties. Holders of Veoneer\u2019s SDRs will be treated in accordance with the Depository Agreement.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nOnly stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2021, are entitled to notice of the\nSpecial Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your\nshares of Veoneer Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are \u201cnon-routine\nmatters,\u201d your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the\nSpecial Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name or if you are a holder of SDRs\nare described under the question \u201cHow may I vote?\u201d below.\nQ:\nAre holders of Veoneer\u2019s SDRs entitled to vote?\nA:\nHolders of Veoneer\u2019s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if\nthey directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share\nof Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date.

This will include an\naffidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to\npost a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Veoneer Stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any\nother reason, Veoneer Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Veoneer Common Stock.\nInstead, Veoneer will remain an independent public company, Veoneer Common Stock and SDRs will continue to\nbe listed and traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm, respectively, and registered under the Exchange Act,\nand we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Veoneer may be required to pay\nthe Acquiring Parties the Termination Fee of $110,000,000. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under other\nspecified circumstances, the Acquiring Parties may be required to pay Veoneer the Reverse Termination Fee of\n$225,000,000. Further, under specified circumstances Veoneer may be required to reimburse Qualcomm for the\n$110,000,000 that Qualcomm paid to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nSee the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u037e Expenses\u201d beginning on page 110 of\nthis Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nDo any of Veoneer\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ from\nthose of Veoneer Stockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that Veoneer\u2019s directors and executive officers for purposes of this Proxy\nStatement may have interests in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Veoneer\nStockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests\nexisted at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in\napproving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted\nby Veoneer Stockholders. For a description of the interests of Veoneer\u2019s directors and executive officers in the\nMerger, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain\ncompensation arrangements for Veoneer\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger, commonly referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is\nrequired to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the\nVeoneer Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special\nMeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the\nproposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if\nthe number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of\noutstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be\ncounted as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the proposal to approve\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Merger. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nAs of November 12, 2021, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there\nwere approximately 111,997,942 shares of Veoneer Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each holder of\nVeoneer Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Veoneer Common Stock owned by such holder as of\nthe Record Date.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered,\nwith respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy\ncard have been sent directly to you by Veoneer. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by\nproxy, which involves granting your voting rights directly to Veoneer or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at\nthe Special Meeting.\nIf your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of\nthose shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other\nnominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial\nowner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Without your\nvoting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your broker, bank or\nother nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.\nHolders of Veoneer\u2019s SDRs are entitled to vote the shares of Veoneer Common Stock underlying their SDRs as if\nthey directly held Veoneer Common Stock. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share\nof Veoneer Common Stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. We encourage you to vote prior to the\nmeeting to ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at\nmeeting to ensure your vote is properly received and counted. SDR holders registered on an account directly at\nEuroclear or with a Swedish nominee will receive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the\ninternet by following the instructions set forth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders\nacting as non-Swedish nominees are urged to mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from\ntheir clients, aggregate these and vote for their clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set\nforth in the proxy materials received by regular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to\ncontact your broker to vote.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of Veoneer\nCommon Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special\nMeeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Veoneer\nCommon Stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d The Board has designated Jan Carlson and Lars Sj\u00f6bring and each of\nthem, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nCan I change or revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYou may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you\nattend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following\nways:\n\u2022\nby re-voting at a subsequent time by internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed\nproxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it\nfollowing the instructions on the enclosed proxy card\u037e\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nby delivering a signed revocation letter to Lars Sj\u00f6bring, Veoneer\u2019s Corporate Secretary, at Veoneer\u2019s\nmailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you\nhave revoked your proxy\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special\nMeeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote\nby virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.\nYour latest dated proxy card, internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.\nIf your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your voting\ninstructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee.\nQ:\nIf a Veoneer Stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the internet or telephone process\nor the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting\non all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting. Holders of SDRs must\nvote in accordance with the instructions they receive with their proxy materials.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will\nor may become payable by Veoneer to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nA:\nThe holders of a majority in voting power of all issued and outstanding Veoneer Common Stock entitled to vote\ngenerally at the Special Meeting, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of\nbusiness at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 111,997,942 shares\nof Veoneer Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a properly executed proxy\nby internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will be\ncounted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Because both proposals presented to stockholders will be\nconsidered non-discretionary, shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name for a beneficial\nowner will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if the beneficial owner provides no instructions\nregarding how those shares should be voted. As a result, such shares will be deemed not present at the Special\nMeeting and not count for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of shares provides\nvoting instructions on either or both proposals, then the bank, broker or other nominee is entitled to vote such\nshares as instructed and they will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and count towards the quorum. As\na result, at least 55,998,972 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not\npresent, the holders of a majority in voting power of the Veoneer Common Stock, present or represented by\nproxy, and entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting\npursuant to Veoneer\u2019s bylaws.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain a proxy card?\nA:\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.\nFor Veoneer Stockholders of record: Please call Georgeson LLC (\u201cGeorgeson\u201d) at (866) 741-9588.\nFor holders in \u201cstreet name\u201d: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar\ninstitution.\nFor SDR holders: SDR holders registered on an account directly at Euroclear or with a Swedish nominee will\nreceive proxy materials by regular mail and are urged to vote over the internet by following the instructions set\nforth in the proxy materials such SDR holder receives. SDR holders acting as non-Swedish nominees are urged\nto mail an information letter to their clients and to retrieve votes from their clients, aggregate these and vote for\ntheir clients using the ID Number and Code (and other actions) set forth in the proxy materials received by\nregular mail. If you are a client holding SDRs, we encourage you to contact your broker to vote.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Veoneer Common Stock after the close of business on\nthe Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be\nconsummated.

Our directors, officers and employees may solicit\nproxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these\ndirectors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services.

Veoneer intends to notify stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by issuing a\npress release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Veoneer Common Stock for cash pursuant to\nthe Merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Veoneer Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 84 of this Proxy Statement) who\nexchanges shares of Veoneer Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\namount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the\nU.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 84 of this Proxy\nStatement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have certain\nconnections with the United States.\nFor a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 84 of this\nProxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of outstanding Veoneer equity awards receive in the Merger?\nA:\nIn general, holders of outstanding Veoneer equity awards will receive the cash value of the award, based on the\nMerger Consideration.

If the exercise price per\nshare of Veoneer Common Stock of such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,\nsuch Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in\nrespect thereof.\nEach Company RSU, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and\nwithout any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any\nwithholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of\nVeoneer Common Stock underlying such Company RSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in\nrespect of dividend equivalent units credited thereon (if any)) multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.\nEach Company PSU, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, automatically and\nwithout any required action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any\nwithholding of taxes required under applicable law, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Veoneer\nCommon Stock underlying such Company PSU (including any shares of Veoneer Common Stock in respect of\ndividend equivalent units credited thereon (if any)) with performance measured (x) based on the attainment of\nthe applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance for any performance periods that have\nconcluded prior to October 4, 2021, and (y) based on the greater of attainment of the applicable performance\nmetrics at the target level of performance or at the actual level of performance (as determined by the Board) as\nmeasured through the Closing Date for any open performance periods after October 4, 2021, multiplied by (ii) the\nMerger Consideration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, each Veoneer equity award that may be granted to employees after October 4,\n2021, will have terms and conditions that are consented to by the Acquiring Parties.\nFor additional information regarding the treatment of Veoneer\u2019s outstanding equity awards, see the section\nentitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration-Outstanding Company Equity Awards\u201d\nbeginning on page 89 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be consummated?\nA:\nVeoneer and the Acquiring Parties are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. At this\ntime, the timing of receipt of necessary regulatory approvals is difficult to predict. However, assuming the timely\nreceipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the Merger\nAgreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Veoneer Stockholders of the proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in 2022.

Instead,\nVeoneer will remain an independent public company, Veoneer Common Stock and SDRs will continue to be listed and\ntraded on the NYSE and Nasdaq Stockholm, respectively, and registered under the Exchange Act, and Veoneer will\ncontinue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Veoneer Common Stock. In addition, if the Merger is not\nconsummated, Veoneer expects that Veoneer\u2019s management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in\nwhich it is being operated today.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the\nMerger not to be consummated, it is possible that the price of Veoneer Common Stock will decline significantly. If that\nwere to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Veoneer Common Stock would return to the price at which it\ntrades as of the date of this Proxy Statement.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Veoneer Common Stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the\nBoard will continue to evaluate and review Veoneer\u2019s business operations, properties, dividend policy and\ncapitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify\nstrategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Veoneer Stockholders\nor if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction\nacceptable to Veoneer will be offered or that Veoneer\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation will not be\nadversely impacted.\n38TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Veoneer may be required to pay the\nAcquiring Parties the Termination Fee of $110,000,000. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under other specified\ncircumstances, the Acquiring Parties may be required to pay Veoneer the Reverse Termination Fee of $225,000,000.\nFurther, under specified circumstances Veoneer may be required to reimburse Qualcomm for the $110,000,000 that\nQualcomm paid to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger Agreement.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nSince Veoneer became an independent public company as a result of its separation from Autoliv, Inc., and the\ndistribution of Veoneer by Autoliv, Inc. in June 2018, as part of Veoneer\u2019s strategic planning process, the Board has\nregularly reviewed and discussed with Veoneer\u2019s senior management and its advisors, including Morgan Stanley,\nwhich advised Autoliv, Inc. in its separation of Veoneer into an independent public company, Veoneer\u2019s performance,\nbusiness strategy and competitive position in the automotive technology industry. These reviews and discussions\nhave focused on topics including, among others, growth strategies, potential divestitures, commercial collaborations\nand joint ventures with third parties and potential acquisitions by Veoneer, as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen\nVeoneer\u2019s overall business and enhance stockholder value. The Board has also periodically reviewed with senior\nmanagement and external advisors, including Morgan Stanley, the automotive technology industry landscape and\ntrends and has discussed the possibility of an acquisition of Veoneer. In addition, in an effort to enhance\npreparedness in the event of potential strategic opportunities or activity, the Board formally engaged Morgan Stanley\nas its financial advisor in October 2018 to advise Veoneer regarding strategic and financial matters, and members of\nVeoneer\u2019s senior management have from time to time met with representatives of Morgan Stanley and other\ninvestment banks and advisory firms, including Rothschild & Co, to discuss dynamics of the automotive industry\nand potential strategic alternatives that Veoneer could consider.\nFollowing a strategic review initially launched in April 2019, in light of the significant opportunity for future growth in\nthe Active Safety industry, accompanied with increasing competition in that sector and the resulting need for scale\nand significant up-front investment capital and research and development, Veoneer made a decision, after\nconsultation with its advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to narrow the focus of its standalone strategic plan to the\ncommercialization of Active Safety and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In pursuit of that goal, (i) in May 2019,\nVeoneer raised capital in an underwritten public offering of $420 million of Veoneer Common Stock and $207 million\naggregate principal amount of 4.00% convertible senior notes due in 2024, with Morgan Stanley acting as lead book-\nrunning manager for such offerings, and (ii) Veoneer elected to exit the brake systems business, which exit was\nsubstantially completed in 2020, and to dissolve Zenuity, Veoneer\u2019s software joint venture with Volvo Cars. At the\nsame time, as part of Veoneer\u2019s ongoing strategic planning process, representatives of Veoneer have, in the ordinary\ncourse and from time to time, discussed with various companies in the automotive sector potential commercial\npartnerships and strategic collaboration opportunities that might expand their respective businesses, improve their\nrespective customer offerings and create value for Veoneer Stockholders.\nIn mid-2019, Veoneer was contacted by an entity that indicated preliminary interest in pursuing a potential strategic\ntransaction with Veoneer\u037e however following limited preliminary due diligence and preliminary discussion, that entity\ndid not make a proposal for a transaction, and discussions were terminated in early September 2019. On June 28, 2019,\nVeoneer entered into a non-disclosure agreement with a standstill provision, with customary fallaways and the ability\nto make confidential proposals to the Company, and to provide such entity with access to limited non-public financial\ninformation on Veoneer.\n39TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 10, 2019, Mr. Jan Carlson, Chief Executive Officer of Veoneer and Chairman of the Board, met with Mr.\nDonald Walker, then Chief Executive Officer of Magna at an industry conference, Mr. Walker indicated that Magna\nwould be interested in exploring a potential transaction with Veoneer.\nDuring the last several weeks in September 2019, Mr. Carlson had several follow-up conversations with Mr. Walker\nand representatives from Magna during which Magna provided its preliminary views on the strategic benefits of a\npotential transaction involving Veoneer and Magna, and described the information Magna would need to further\ndevelop its views on such a potential transaction. In the course of Mr. Carlson\u2019s regular communications with\nmembers of the Board, Mr. Carlson updated the Board on Magna\u2019s indication of interest in a potential transaction\nwith Veoneer. Mr. Walker confirmed Magna\u2019s interest in a letter to Mr. Carlson dated October 3, 2019. On October 4,\n2019, Mr. Carlson informed the directors of the receipt of Magna\u2019s letter. Messrs. Carlson and Walker agreed that\nVeoneer and Magna would enter into a non-disclosure agreement as a pre-condition to Veoneer providing\nconfidential information to Magna. On October 9, 2019, Veoneer entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Magna,\nwhich did not include a standstill provision, to provide Magna with access to limited non-public financial information\non Veoneer.\nOn October 10, 2019, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Nishant Batra, then Chief Technology Officer of Veoneer, met with Mr.\nWalker and Mr. Swamy Kotagiri, then Chief Technology Officer of Magna, to discuss the general strategic landscape\nin which both companies operate, including potential challenges and opportunities for their respective businesses.\nOver the course of the following week, representatives of Veoneer met with and provided representatives of Magna\nwith limited non-public financial information on Veoneer responsive to select requests sent from Magna. Mr. Walker\nfollowed up on the additional information provided with an email on October 17, 2019, confirming Magna\u2019s interest in\na transaction and requesting additional financial information to support Magna in submitting an indication of\ninterest. Over the next two weeks Veoneer provided the requested information.\nOn October 22, 2019, the Board held an informational session to receive an update from Mr. Carlson on the most\nrecent communication from Magna and provide an overview of the limited financial information being made available\nto Magna to support Magna in submitting an indication of interest.\nOn October 31, 2019, Mr. Walker sent to Mr. Carlson a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to\nacquire all of Veoneer\u2019s outstanding equity at a value of $18.00-19.25 per share (\u201cOctober 2019 Proposal\u201d).\nOn November 6 and November 7, 2019, the Board held meetings, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co were present, to consider the unsolicited October 2019\nProposal from Magna. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co provided their preliminary\nperspectives on the value indicated by such proposal. After discussion, the Board determined that the October 2019\nProposal did not provide adequate basis for further engagement. As such, the Board instructed Veoneer\u2019s senior\nmanagement to convey such message to Magna. On November 8, 2019, as instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson\ncontacted Mr. Walker to convey Veoneer\u2019s response, and later that day sent a written response to Magna reflecting\nsuch decision. Messrs. Carlson and Walker agreed that the parties would terminate discussions and proceed with\nexecuting their respective standalone strategic plans.\nOver the course of the following twelve months, Veoneer continued to execute its standalone strategic plan, including\nexecuting definitive agreements to exit the brake systems business and dissolve the Zenuity joint venture with Volvo\nCars.\nDuring the same period, representatives from Qualcomm and Veoneer engaged in numerous discussions regarding\npotential opportunities for commercial collaborations between Veoneer and Qualcomm, including regarding the\ndevelopment of the Arriver Business. Qualcomm and Veoneer entered into a confidentiality agreement in June 2020 in\nconnection with these commercial collaboration discussions. On August 27, 2020, Veoneer and Qualcomm\nTechnologies, Inc. (\u201cQTI\u201d), a subsidiary of Qualcomm, announced their decision to collaborate on the delivery of\nscalable ADAS and AD solutions, powered by Veoneer\u2019s next-generation perception and driving policy software\nstack and the Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon Ride\u2122 ADAS/AD scalable portfolio of System on a Chip (SoC) and\nAccelerators. The August 27, 2020 press release announcing such collaboration noted that the next generation\nsoftware stack would be developed in a dedicated organization within Veoneer and that Veoneer and QTI had signed\na non-binding letter of intent, with definitive agreements anticipated to be finalized thereafter. Following this time\nthrough January 2021, Veoneer and QTI negotiated agreements to implement such collaboration.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 22, 2020, Mr. Kotagiri, who was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Magna on October 19, 2020,\ncontacted Mr. Carlson to update Mr. Carlson on his recent appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of Magna and\nto discuss general market dynamics. Subsequently, in the course of Mr. Carlson\u2019s regular communications with\nmembers of the Board, Mr. Carlson informed the Board of the outreach by Mr. Kotagiri.\nIn January 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had informal discussions during which Mr. Kotagiri indicated that\nMagna had been impressed with Veoneer\u2019s strategic accomplishments since discussions between the parties had\nterminated in 2019, including Veoneer\u2019s disposition of its brake systems business, the collaboration on ADAS and\nthe restructuring of existing joint ventures, and that Magna was interested in exploring a strategic transaction with\nVeoneer. On February 16, 2021, Mr. Carlson updated the Board at its regularly scheduled meeting of Magna\u2019s\ncontinued interest and engagement.\nOn January 26, 2021, Veoneer and QTI announced the execution of definitive agreements pursuant to which the\nparties would collaborate on the delivery of scalable ADAS/AD solutions (the \u201cMaster Collaboration Agreement\u201d).\nOn March 22, 2021, Magna submitted a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of Veoneer\u2019s\noutstanding equity for up to $30 per share in an all-cash transaction (the \u201cMarch 2021 Proposal\u201d), which\nrepresented a premium of up to 20% to Veoneer\u2019s closing share price on March 22, 2021. Later that same day, Mr.\nKotagiri contacted Mr. Carlson to reiterate Magna\u2019s interest in an acquisition of Veoneer. Mr. Carlson conveyed to\nMr. Kotagiri that he would discuss the March 2021 Proposal with the Board. On March 23, 2021, Mr. Carlson sent an\nemail to the Board providing an update on Magna\u2019s continued interest in Veoneer and Veoneer\u2019s receipt of the March\n2021 Proposal.\nOn March 25, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Morgan Stanley were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on his discussions\nwith Mr. Kotagiri, and the Board discussed the terms of the March 2021 Proposal, with members of management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley providing their perspectives. After discussion, the Board determined that the\nMarch 2021 Proposal was inadequate to provide a basis for further engagement, as it did not provide a per share\nvalue or value range, only a maximum possible value, and did not provide any of Magna\u2019s assumptions underlying\nthe maximum possible value offered. The Board instructed management to convey such a response to Magna and\nalso convey that, subject to the execution of a new non-disclosure agreement, Veoneer would be willing to provide\ncertain limited, non-public business and financial information to facilitate Magna\u2019s submission of a more substantive\nindication of interest. The Board instructed management to engage outside legal counsel, and after receiving\ninformation about Rothschild & Co\u2019s expertise, experience and relationships, authorized management to formally\nengage Rothschild & Co as an additional financial advisor for Veoneer due to Rothschild & Co\u2019s industry expertise,\nexperience and relationships. The scope of Rothschild & Co\u2019s engagement was consistent with Morgan Stanley\u2019s as\nthe Board determined it would benefit from additional perspectives provided by Rothschild & Co.\nAs instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson contacted Mr. Kotagiri and conveyed the Board\u2019s response, indicating that a\nletter would follow. Mr. Kotagiri stated that Magna would be willing to provide an updated proposal based on such\nadditional information from Veoneer. Later that day, Veoneer and Magna entered into a non-disclosure agreement to\nfacilitate such further discussions, which did not include a standstill.\nOn March 29, 2021, Mr. Carlson sent a letter to Mr. Kotagiri, informing Magna that the March 2021 Proposal was\ninadequate to provide a basis for further engagement, and that while the Board was not pursuing a sale of Veoneer, if\nMagna sought further engagement, it would have to provide a clearer and more definitive indication of interest,\nincluding a clear per share price range fully reflecting the strategic value of Veoneer to Magna.\nOn April 1, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion regarding the additional information that\nMagna needed in order to provide an updated proposal with a clearer indication of value. On April 7, 2021, Veoneer\nprovided Magna with select non-public financial information, in response to certain of the items that Magna had\nidentified as being required to update its proposal.\nIn April 2021, Veoneer entered into an indemnification agreement with Rothschild & Co, and subsequently, in June\n2021 received certain disclosures for the Board regarding Rothschild & Co\u2019s material relationships with Veoneer,\nMagna and Qualcomm during the prior two years (the \u201cRothschild Relationship Disclosure\u201d), and, in July 2021\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nentered into an engagement letter with Rothschild & Co. In July 2021, Veoneer also entered into an addendum to its\nexisting engagement letter with Morgan Stanley and received certain disclosures for the Board regarding Morgan\nStanley\u2019s material relationships with Veoneer, Magna and Qualcomm during the prior thirty (30) months (the \u201cMorgan\nStanley Relationship Disclosure\u201d).\nOn April 11, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to acquire all of\nVeoneer\u2019s outstanding equity for between $28 and $30 per share in an all-cash transaction (the \u201cApril 2021\nProposal\u201d), which represented a premium between 13% and 21% to Veoneer\u2019s closing share price on April 9, 2021.\nThe April 2021 Proposal set forth certain key assumptions underlying the proposed value and stated that Magna\u2019s\nability to confirm proposed value would depend on validating certain of those assumptions through due diligence on\nVeoneer, which Magna was prepared to engage in immediately. Magna also indicated in the April 2021 Proposal that\nbeing able to engage on a bilateral basis would be critical to Magna. The April 2021 Proposal also contained Magna\u2019s\nrequest to enter into an exclusivity agreement.\nOn April 12, 2021, Sidley Austin LLP (\u201cSidley\u201d), Magna\u2019s outside legal counsel, provided Veoneer and its outside\ncounsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), with a draft exclusivity agreement.\nOn April 15, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on his\ndiscussions with Mr. Kotagiri and the limited non-public information that had been provided to Magna, in\naccordance with the Board\u2019s instructions, and the Board discussed the terms of the April 2021 Proposal, including\nthe request for Veoneer to enter into an exclusivity agreement. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild &\nCo reviewed their preliminary analyses of the proposed transaction. Following the Board\u2019s discussion of the terms of\nthe April 2021 Proposal, with management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co providing\ntheir perspectives, the Board determined that the indicated value range in the April 2021 Proposal did not fully reflect\nthe value represented by Veoneer and did not provide an appropriate basis for further engagement. The Board\ninstructed management to reject Magna\u2019s April 2021 Proposal, including the request for an exclusivity agreement, but\nto inform Magna that the Board would be willing to engage further if Magna were to provide a meaningfully higher\nindication of value. Furthermore, the Board directed management to provide limited additional non-public information\nto Magna, subject to the parties\u2019 existing non-disclosure agreement, and to make select members of management\navailable to answer follow-up questions relating to the information provided, which the Board believed would\nenhance Magna\u2019s ability to put forward a meaningfully higher indication of value. In a letter dated April 19, 2021,\nVeoneer conveyed the Board\u2019s determinations to Magna and subsequently worked with Magna to provide additional\ndue diligence materials during the weeks thereafter.\nOn May 7, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding indication of interest for Magna to acquire all of\nVeoneer\u2019s outstanding equity for $30 to $32 per share in an all-cash transaction (the \u201cMay 2021 Proposal\u201d), which\nrepresented a premium of between 30% and 38% to Veoneer\u2019s closing share price on May 6. Later that same day, Mr.\nCarlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion, in which Mr. Kotagiri emphasized that the value range\nindicated in the May 2021 Proposal was the highest possible proposed value range that Magna was willing to offer\nprior to engaging in comprehensive diligence and reiterated Magna\u2019s expectation of bilateral negotiations if the\nparties were to move forward on the basis of the May 2021 Proposal.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non the terms of the May 2021 Proposal from Magna and his discussions with Mr. Kotagiri, with members of\nmanagement providing their perspectives. At the request of the Board, the representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nRothschild & Co reviewed the financial terms of the May 2021 Proposal from Magna and their preliminary financial\nanalyses of the proposed transaction, representatives of Skadden reviewed certain legal matters, including directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties in the context of evaluating a proposal to acquire Veoneer, and process considerations relevant to\nsuch an evaluation. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co also reviewed with the Board certain\nalternative paths available to Veoneer, including determining not to further pursue a potential transaction with Magna\nand focusing on Veoneer\u2019s standalone plan, engaging in further due diligence and discussions with Magna on a\nbilateral basis, and engaging further with Magna in the context of a broader process involving additional parties,\nalong with the potential benefits and considerations in connection with each alternative. Members of Veoneer\nmanagement noted for the Board parties with whom preliminary discussions regarding various transactions had been\nheld in the past, and reviewed the nature of more recent contacts received regarding interest in various types of asset\ntransactions with Veoneer, which included discussions with Magna, a verbally communicated\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninterest from a strategic firm involved in the automotive safety industry (\u201cParty A\u201d) in an acquisition of the Restraint\nControl Systems (\u201cRCS\u201d) business without any indication of proposed value, and a verbally communicated interest\nfrom another strategic firm involved in the automotive safety industry (\u201cParty B\u201d) in an acquisition of the Arriver\nBusiness. The Board discussed such alternative paths and the potential benefits and risks associated with each such\npath, including the potential negative impact of disposing particular assets on the remainder of Veoneer. The Board\ndetermined, based on such discussions, that management should clarify the intentions of Party A and Party B,\nincluding any initial indication of value.\nThe Board also discussed Veoneer\u2019s relationship with Qualcomm in its capacity as a commercial partner, its possible\nreaction to an acquisition of Veoneer by a third party, and related considerations for further engagement with Magna.\nThe Board, members of management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden also\ndiscussed Magna\u2019s request for an exclusivity agreement and reviewed the potential impact of an exclusivity grant on\nprocess and Veoneer\u2019s flexibility, the potential impact on negotiating leverage, the possibility of Magna not\nproceeding with further engagement absent exclusivity, and other factors.\nFollowing discussion, the Board determined that the May 2021 Proposal from Magna appeared to represent a\npotential opportunity for Veoneer Stockholders to realize value that could be superior to the continued execution of\nthe current standalone business plan, considering market uncertainties and execution risks including challenges as\nVeoneer seeks to transition its business to focus on ADAS and Active Safety, which requires significant investment\nin order to fund future operations with uncertainty as to the timing and amount of return on investment, and ongoing\nsemiconductor supply shortages that are creating industry delivery and cost challenges for Veoneer as well as other\nindustry participants. The Board noted, however, that the May 2021 Proposal from Magna still lacked definitiveness\nin key aspects. The Board instructed management to prepare to continue further engagement with Magna in order to\nseek further definitiveness in its proposal, and to reject the request for an exclusivity agreement, but not to respond\nwith this message until members of management had clarified the terms of outreach that had recently been received\nfrom Party A.\nOn May 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson provided an update\non his discussions with members of management of Party A, which indicated it was not willing to provide an\nindicative value range or further clarity on any proposed terms, and that management was working to schedule a call\nto discuss with Party B\u2019s management its interest. The Board further discussed, with input from the advisors,\nMagna\u2019s May 2021 Proposal, Veoneer\u2019s current market prices, Veoneer\u2019s standalone business plan and the risks of\nsuccessfully executing the standalone business plan. The Board also discussed the status of Magna\u2019s interest,\nMagna\u2019s request for an exclusivity agreement, the ability to continue to keep Magna engaged in developing a\nsolidified proposal and the potential risks posed by contacting additional parties to solicit possible interest, and\ndetermined that Veoneer should not contact additional parties at that time. Following discussion, the Board instructed\nmanagement to proceed with further engagement with Magna, including through the provision of due diligence to\nallow Magna to solidify a proposal, but only after entry into a more comprehensive non-disclosure agreement with a\ncustomary standstill, and not to enter at that time into the exclusivity agreement requested by Magna. In light of the\ndetermination to further engage with Magna, the Board also instructed management to notify Qualcomm of Veoneer\u2019s\nreceipt of a proposal for a potential acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Master Collaboration Agreement.\nOn May 14, 2021, Veoneer provided QTI with notice pursuant to the Master Collaboration Agreement that Veoneer\nhad received a proposal from a third-party relating to a potential acquisition of Veoneer.\nIn addition, on May 14, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri had a telephonic discussion, in which Mr. Carlson\nconveyed that while the Board did not believe that Magna\u2019s May 2021 Proposal reflected the full value of Veoneer,\nthe Board was willing to pursue further engagement, including giving Magna access to broader due diligence, to\nsupport Magna in making a more definitive proposal at a higher value. Following such conversation, Mr. Carlson sent\na response letter to Magna\u2019s May 2021 Proposal, reflecting the foregoing conversation. Also, on May 14, 2021, Mr.\nLars Sj\u00f6bring, General Counsel of Veoneer, sent to members of Magna management a revised version of the existing\nnon-disclosure agreement, updated to include a standstill provision, along with a draft clean team agreement with\nrespect to provision of certain commercially sensitive information. Over the course of the following week,\nrepresentatives of Skadden and Sidley negotiated the terms of the non-disclosure agreement and clean team\nconfidentiality agreement.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 17, 2021, Qualcomm\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer elect, Cristiano Amon, had a telephonic\ndiscussion with Mr. Carlson to discuss the potential impact of an acquisition of Veoneer on the collaboration\narrangements between Qualcomm and Veoneer.\nOn May 18, 2021, Mr. Nakul Duggal, the Senior Vice President and General Manager, Automotive, and Mr. Duane\nNelles, the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Qualcomm, had a telephonic discussion with Mr.\nCarlson and Mr. Sj\u00f6bring to express Qualcomm\u2019s interest in acquiring Veoneer\u2019s Arriver Business, and to express\nconcern about the impact an acquisition of Veoneer by a third party would have on the collaboration arrangements\nbetween Qualcomm and Veoneer under the Master Collaboration Agreement.\nAlso, on May 18, 2021, members of the managements of Veoneer and Magna held a telephonic discussion with\nrespect to the diligence process for the next several weeks, including application of clean team protocols with respect\nto commercially sensitive information.\nOn May 20, 2021, Magna and Veoneer finalized and entered into the amended and restated non-disclosure agreement\n(the \u201cMagna NDA\u201d), which included a standstill provision with customary fallaways and the ability to make\nconfidential proposals to the Company, and the clean team confidentiality agreement.\nOn May 20, 2021, following up on the telephonic discussions held on May 17 and May 18, 2021, Qualcomm notified\nVeoneer that it desired to enter into discussions regarding the acquisition of the Arriver Business. Representatives of\nVeoneer and Qualcomm had subsequent communications regarding their commercial relationship during the course of\nwhich Qualcomm reiterated its intention to submit a proposal to acquire Arriver.\nMr. Carlson subsequently provided an update to the Board regarding diligence by Magna, Qualcomm\u2019s indicated\ninterest, status of communications with Party B with respect to its interest in the Arriver Business and related assets\nand the outreach from a company in the automotive technology industry (\u201cParty C\u201d) regarding its interest in\npursuing an undefined transaction involving the Arriver Business. No subsequent proposals were submitted by\nParty B or Party C, and discussions with Party A, Party B and Party C did not progress to the point where such\nparties executed non-disclosure agreements or received non-public information regarding Veoneer.\nOver the course of the following three weeks, members of Veoneer management and Magna management, along with\ntheir advisors, held multiple video conference calls to discuss a variety of diligence topics, including finance,\nbusiness, human resources, legal, tax and regulatory matters. Representatives of Veoneer\u2019s and Magna\u2019s advisors\nalso attended these calls. On June 9, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, on behalf of\nVeoneer, sent a letter to Magna outlining the process for Magna to submit a solidified proposal for its proposed\nacquisition of Veoneer, and requesting that such solidified proposal be submitted on or before June 11, 2021.\nOn June 15, 2021, in response to the process letter of June 9, Mr. Kotagiri submitted an updated, non-binding\nindication of interest for Magna to acquire all of Veoneer\u2019s outstanding equity for $31.25 per share in an all-cash\ntransaction (the \u201cJune 2021 Proposal\u201d), which represented a premium of 29% to Veoneer\u2019s closing share price on\nJune 14. In the June 2021 Proposal, Magna requested certain changes to diligence protocols to enhance Magna\u2019s\naccess to information and reiterated its request for Veoneer to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Magna. On the\nsame day, Magna sent a revised draft exclusivity agreement, providing exclusivity for a period of 28 days, subject to\nautomatic extensions.\nOn June 16, 2021, the Board held a meeting by video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\nwith respect to the process with Magna, including receipt of the June 2021 Proposal and Magna\u2019s request for\nadditional due diligence to permit it to offer enhanced value to Veoneer\u2019s Stockholders, and management\u2019s\ninteractions with Qualcomm, including Qualcomm\u2019s expressed intention to submit a proposal for an acquisition of the\nArriver Business. Representatives of Skadden discussed legal matters and representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nRothschild & Co provided their preliminary perspectives on the June 2021 Proposal from Magna. Mr. Ray Pekar, the\nChief Financial Officer of Veoneer, reviewed with the Board an overview of management\u2019s business planning\nassumptions through 2030 for purposes of management\u2019s standalone valuation of Veoneer. The Board discussed the\nterms of Magna\u2019s June 2021 Proposal and the possibility of a proposal from Qualcomm, and discussed issues\nassociated with any potential sale of the Arriver Business by Veoneer. Following discussion, the Board instructed\nmanagement to, among other things, (1) request a detailed due diligence plan from Magna, to help assess the status\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand the level of difficulty involved in further developing the proposed transaction with Magna, and (2) seek a\nsolidified proposal, including value, from Qualcomm with respect to an acquisition of the Arriver Business to enable\nmanagement and the Board to determine whether further engagement with Qualcomm regarding its proposal would be\nwarranted at that time.\nAlso on June 16, 2021, in accordance with the Board\u2019s directions, Veoneer\u2019s senior management communicated to\nQualcomm Veoneer\u2019s desire that Qualcomm submit a solidified proposal, including an indication of value.\nOn June 18, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a non-binding indication of interest for an acquisition by Qualcomm of one\nhundred percent (100%) of the Arriver Business, and any associated assets, on a cash and debt free basis, for an\naggregate purchase price of $2 billion (\u201cInitial Arriver Proposal\u201d). In the Initial Arriver Proposal, Qualcomm\nindicated that it would be willing to consider Veoneer retaining a minority equity stake in the Arriver Business for a\nperiod of time, as well as exploring a partnership with other potential acquirors for a combined acquisition offer for\nVeoneer. The Initial Arriver Proposal also described Qualcomm\u2019s interest in Veoneer\u2019s Arriver Business due to the\ncomplementary strengths and technical abilities demonstrated under the Master Collaboration Agreement, including\nQualcomm\u2019s belief that its intimate knowledge of the technology and product roadmap of the Arriver Business would\npermit Qualcomm to diligence and execute such a transaction expeditiously.\nOn June 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on the status of the due diligence\nprocess with Magna and the terms of the Initial Arriver Proposal received from Qualcomm. Mr. Pekar reviewed with\nthe Board management\u2019s business plan for 2020-2023 and preliminary long-term planning financial extrapolations\nthrough 2030 based on business planning assumptions previously reviewed with the Board, which the Board\napproved for purposes of providing to Veoneer\u2019s financial advisors as the bases for their financial analyses. The\nBoard discussed considerations with respect to a potential sale of the Arriver Business, including the strategic\nimportance of the Arriver Business to Veoneer\u2019s future business plan, the potential value represented, and additional\nrisks and challenges in such a transaction, including, among other things, complexity in separation, tax costs and\nramifications to the remaining business and other reasonably available alternatives to Veoneer. Representatives of\nSkadden discussed legal matters. Following discussion, the Board instructed management to (1) continue to engage\nwith Magna, refine the plan for additional required diligence and reject exclusivity at this stage, and (2) respond to\nQualcomm with the message that the Arriver Business was not for sale on the terms proposed by Qualcomm in the\nInitial Arriver Proposal, but that the Board might be willing to engage in a discussion with respect to a transfer of\nownership in tranches over a period of time at a significantly higher valuation.\nOver the following weeks, members of Veoneer management engaged with representatives of Qualcomm to discuss\npossible terms of a transaction pursuant to which Qualcomm would acquire the Arriver Business in a staged sale\ntransaction over time, allowing for a more organized disentanglement of the Arriver Business from Veoneer\u2019s other\nbusinesses and providing for continuing ownership by Veoneer of an interest in the entities of the Arriver Business\nfor several years with upside value potential to Veoneer.\nOn June 24, 2021, as instructed by the Board, Mr. Carlson sent a letter to Mr. Kotagiri in response to Magna\u2019s June\n2021 Proposal, stating that, after careful consideration, the Board\u2019s view was that Magna\u2019s June 2021 Proposal still\ndid not reflect the full value of Veoneer, but that the Board was willing to continue providing diligence materials to\nMagna with the expectation that it would help Magna to improve its proposal. Veoneer also indicated that Magna\u2019s\nrequest for additional diligence materials was overly generic, and proposed that the management teams work together\nto ensure targeted scope and process for remaining diligence. Members of Veoneer management and Magna\nmanagement, along with representatives of their respective advisors, worked together over the following days to\nrefine the scope of remaining due diligence.\nOn June 27, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest to Veoneer, together with a term\nsheet for an acquisition of the Arriver Business indicating an increase in its proposed valuation for the Arriver\nBusiness to $2.5 billion if certain milestones were met. Subsequently, on June 28, 2021, Qualcomm provided Veoneer\nwith a further revised non-binding indication of interest, increasing the potential earnout valuation if certain\nmilestones were met.\nOn July 1, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Pekar updated the Board on\nthe financial performance of Veoneer. Mr. Carlson updated the Board on the terms of Qualcomm\u2019s proposal for an\nacquisition of the Arriver Business and the status of discussions with Magna, including management\u2019s continued\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nengagement on diligence in an effort to enable Magna to improve its June 2021 Proposal. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley and Rothschild & Co provided preliminary perspectives on Magna\u2019s June 2021 Proposal and Qualcomm\u2019s\nproposal for an acquisition of the Arriver Business. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters with the\nBoard, including an overview of key provisions that will be in the merger agreement, including customary \u201cno-shop\u201d\ncovenants. The Board, management and Veoneer\u2019s advisors discussed, among other things, Magna\u2019s request for an\nexclusivity agreement, potential outreach to additional third parties soliciting interest in a transaction with Veoneer\nand the potential benefits and risks of reaching out to additional parties. Following discussion, the Board determined\nthat at such time the potential risks of outreach to third parties outweighed the potential benefits, and instructed\nmanagement to continue to engage with Magna and to seek to improve its June 2021 Proposal, to continue rejecting\nentry into an exclusivity agreement and to engage further with Qualcomm if it reverted with a meaningful increase in\nvalue offered for the Arriver Business.\nOver the course of the following three weeks, members of Veoneer management and Magna management continued\nto engage in the due diligence process. Representatives of Veoneer\u2019s and Magna\u2019s advisors attended certain of these\nmeetings.\nOn July 6, 2021, Qualcomm submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest, dated July 4, 2021, and revised\nterm sheet, indicating its proposed valuation for the Arriver Business, comprising a baseline valuation of $2.5 billion\nthrough a series of three (3) investments by Qualcomm - an initial $1.0 billion dollar investment followed by a $500\nmillion investment on the first anniversary of the initial investment and a $1.0 billion investment on the second\nanniversary of the initial investment, with up to $400 million in potential additional consideration based on the\nachievement of certain performance targets relating to the Arriver Business being awarded a prescribed number of\nOEM contracts, which it stated as constituting its best and final offer for the Arriver Business.\nOn July 8, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non the diligence process with Magna, the revised proposal from Qualcomm for an acquisition of the Arriver Business\nand an informal unsolicited contact from a private equity firm regarding potential interest in Veoneer\u2019s Non-Arriver\nBusiness. With respect to the revised proposal for the Arriver Business, management reviewed with the Board the\npotential ramifications from a sale of the Arriver Business that might not be accounted for in Qualcomm\u2019s proposal,\nincluding significant tax costs and the obligation to continue funding future operational and capital expenditures of\nthe Arriver Business until the closing of the final investment tranche. Management also reviewed with the Board the\nchallenges to the remaining business posed by a sale of the Arriver Business, including the potential for negative\nreactions from customers, loss of revenue and potential risks to the ability to capture certain business opportunities\nas a result of significantly reduced size. The Board discussed the need to assess the value of Qualcomm\u2019s proposal in\nlight of the foregoing ramifications and challenges on the remaining business. The Board also discussed whether to\nreach out to additional parties at that time, and, determined that the potential downsides of outreach to third parties\nwould outweigh the potential benefits, and that at such time, it would be advisable to focus on maximizing value in\nthe transactions proposed by each of Magna and Qualcomm. As such, the Board instructed management to continue\npursuing both potential transactions with Magna and Qualcomm, and to encourage Qualcomm to make a proposal for\nthe whole company in light of the challenges posed by a sale of the Arriver Business. At the same meeting,\nrepresentatives of Skadden also reviewed a summary of the terms of the draft merger agreement prepared for possible\ndistribution to Magna.\nOn July 9, 2021, Skadden sent a draft of the Magna Merger Agreement to Sidley.\nIn the lead up to July 11, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Amon, the Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm, had a telephonic\ndiscussion regarding its revised proposal for the Arriver Business. Mr. Carlson conveyed Veoneer\u2019s position and\nfollowed up with a letter on July 11, 2021, indicating that while Veoneer remained open to any value-maximizing\ntransaction for its stockholders, the revised proposal from Qualcomm did not fully compensate Veoneer for the value\nof the Arriver Business and the associated costs and potential impact of such a sale on Veoneer\u2019s remaining\nbusinesses. During the same discussion, Mr. Carlson encouraged Mr. Amon to find a buyer of the Non-Arriver\nBusiness as part of an acquisition of Veoneer. Veoneer\u2019s response letter also provided that a proposal with a\nsubstantially higher baseline valuation and opportunity for meaningful upside, might be viewed favorably the Board\nbut would need to address the associated challenges and dis-synergies, or that alternatively, a proposal for the whole\ncompany could address these issues.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 15, 2021, Veoneer management sent a mark-up of the draft term sheet to Qualcomm. Among other things,\nVeoneer management requested that Qualcomm consider making a proposal for the whole company and indicated that\nany sale of the Arriver Business would need to compensate Veoneer Stockholders for any of the costs and dis-\nsynergies that might be realized in connection with separating the Arriver Business.\nOn July 16, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non discussions with Magna and Qualcomm. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their\npreliminary financial analyses of the June 2021 Proposal from Magna, including based on preliminary long-term\nplanning financial extrapolations through 2030 based on business planning assumptions previously reviewed with\nthe Board, which the Board approved for purposes of providing to Veoneer\u2019s financial advisors as the basis for their\nfinancial analysis, as well as preliminary long term planning financial extrapolations for 2031-2035 based on business\nplanning assumptions provided by Veoneer\u2019s management and reviewed with the Board. Mr. Pekar reviewed\nmanagement\u2019s financial analyses of Qualcomm\u2019s proposal for the Arriver Business, including sensitivity analyses\nbased on the Arriver Business\u2019s future performance, which would determine any potential upward adjustment in\npurchase price under the proposal. Members of management also reviewed in more depth with the Board the\nchallenges for the remaining Veoneer businesses following a sale of the Arriver Business, including the burden of a\nsignificantly smaller company maintaining dual listing status, costs of restructuring resulting from the Arriver\nBusiness carve-out, dis-synergies and the potential for negative impact on retention of employees. Management\ninformed the Board that Qualcomm continued to decline to make a proposal with respect to a whole company\ntransaction. The Board discussed the attractiveness of Magna\u2019s June 2021 Proposal and the preliminary financial\nanalyses reviewed by Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, the risks to management\u2019s standalone plan and the\nbenefits and risks of the potential alternatives available to the Company, including a sale of the Arriver Business to\nQualcomm. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters with the Board. Following discussion, the Board\ninstructed management to continue engaging with Magna and Qualcomm, with the goal of maximizing value\nproposed by both parties.\nOn July 16, 2021, Skadden received a mark-up of the Magna Merger Agreement from Sidley, which raised several\nissues, including the standard for regulatory efforts, a requirement of Magna receiving certain stockholder support\nagreements, certain exclusions to the definition of \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect,\u201d treatment of unvested equity awards\nand certain restrictions on the business prior to closing.\nOn July 19, 2021, representatives of Skadden discussed the mark-up of the Magna Merger Agreement with Sidley,\nand identified the key open issues that would need to be resolved. Over the course of the following few days,\nrepresentatives of Skadden, Sidley and members of Veoneer and Magna management, negotiated the Magna Merger\nAgreement, the stockholder voting agreements related to the Magna Merger Agreement and the disclosure\nschedules to the Magna Merger Agreement, and also completed confirmatory due diligence by Magna.\nOn July 19, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non negotiations with Magna and Qualcomm noting that Qualcomm declined to deliver a written proposal for the\nwhole company. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co each reviewed their preliminary financial\nanalyses of Qualcomm\u2019s proposal to acquire the Arriver Business. Following discussion, the Board instructed\nmanagement to prioritize negotiations with Magna, in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in, and substantial\npotential negative ramifications arising from, Qualcomm\u2019s proposal to acquire the Arriver Business but to continue to\nseek to further develop the terms of its proposal. At the instruction of the Board, representatives from Veoneer and its\nadvisors continued to make themselves available to Qualcomm in an effort to clarify and develop the terms of\nQualcomm\u2019s proposal\u037e however, at the time, Mr. Amon advised Mr. Carlson that Qualcomm was not prepared to make\nan offer for the entire company and that Qualcomm was not, at that time, willing to improve the terms of its prior\nproposal to acquire the Arriver Business.\nOn July 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non negotiations with Magna and Qualcomm, including Qualcomm\u2019s indication to Mr. Carlson that it was unwilling to\nmake a proposal to acquire Veoneer in its entirety. Mr. Sj\u00f6bring and representatives of Skadden updated the Board on\nthe open issues being negotiated in the Magna Merger Agreement, including the standard for regulatory efforts,\ndelivery of stockholder support agreements related to the Magna Merger Agreement, certain exclusions to the\ndefinition of \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect,\u201d treatment of unvested equity awards and certain restrictions on the business\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprior to closing, covenants relating to non-solicitation of competing transactions and recommendation of the\ntransaction by the Board and exceptions to such covenants, the definition of a superior transaction and whether a\nproposal for the Arriver Business should be included therein, the size of the termination fee payable by Veoneer in\ncertain circumstances, including to enter into a superior proposal, and certain termination events giving rise to\npayment of the termination fee. Following discussion, the Board instructed management to continue prioritizing\nnegotiations with Magna and to continue moving toward finalizing the Magna Merger Agreement.\nOn July 21, members of Veoneer and Magna management, and representatives of Skadden and Sidley, continued to\nnegotiate the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and stockholder support agreements with certain Veoneer\nStockholders who had entered into non-disclosure agreements with Veoneer.\nOn July 21, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Mr. Carlson updated the Board\non negotiations with Magna, and Mr. Sj\u00f6bring provided an update on due diligence, negotiation of the Magna\nMerger Agreement and communications planning. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co\nreviewed their preliminary financial analyses of the June 2021 Proposal from Magna. Following discussion, the Board\ninstructed management to continue finalizing negotiations with Magna, with the goal of entering into a definitive\nagreement with Magna prior to Veoneer\u2019s second quarter earnings release.\nOn July 22, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to consider the proposed\nMagna Merger Agreement. Representatives of Skadden reviewed legal matters and the proposed terms of the Magna\nMerger Agreement, and noted for the Board the resolution of previously open points that had been reviewed with\nthe Board, including the regulatory efforts obligations, certain termination rights, the size of the termination fee and\nthe definition of superior proposal. The directors discussed the terms of the proposed transaction, Veoneer\u2019s\nprospects, the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and other matters. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nRothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of the proposed transaction with Magna, and each\nrendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its respective written opinion to the\nBoard, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations\nand assumptions set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of\nVeoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the Magna Merger Agreement was\nfair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After discussing the proposed transaction and considering the\npresentations by Skadden, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co, the Board unanimously (i) approved the Magna\nMerger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement, including the merger, (ii)\ndetermined that the Magna Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Magna\nMerger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Veoneer and its stockholders and (iii) resolved to\nrecommend that the stockholders of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the merger, the Magna Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board, the parties executed the Magna Merger Agreement on July 22, 2021, and shortly\nthereafter, Veoneer and Magna issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Magna Merger\nAgreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Magna Merger Agreement, Magna entered into voting and\nsupport agreements with certain stockholders (the \u201cVoting Agreement Stockholders\u201d), each of which agreed,\nsubject to certain conditions, to vote its shares of Veoneer Common Stock for the adoption of the Magna Merger\nAgreement. The Voting Agreement Stockholders and their respective affiliates collectively owned 20,738,124 shares\nof Veoneer Common Stock as of the date of the voting and support agreements, representing approximately eighteen\nand a half percent (18.5%) of the total outstanding shares of Veoneer Common Stock.\nOn July 22, prior to the announcement of the Magna Merger Agreement, Mr. Carlson informed Mr. Amon of the\npending announcement.\nOn August 5, 2021, Qualcomm publicly announced that it had submitted an unsolicited non-binding proposal to the\nBoard pursuant to which Qualcomm proposed to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the Veoneer Common Stock\nfor $37.00 per share in cash (as such proposal and documents relating thereto were revised and amended as further\ndescribed herein, the \u201cQualcomm Competing Proposal\u201d), which described, among other things, Qualcomm\u2019s belief\nthat together Qualcomm and Veoneer would be uniquely positioned to accelerate competition and create a choice for\nthe automotive ecosystem, as well as Qualcomm\u2019s indication that it was prepared to offer \u201cregulatory-related closing\nprotection\u201d to Veoneer, following the completion of its focused due diligence review. The Qualcomm Competing\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProposal also noted that while Qualcomm\u2019s interest in Veoneer is driven by the Arriver Business and Qualcomm plans\nto explore a divestment of the Non-Arriver Business to parties who are better positioned to grow the Non-Arriver\nBusiness, neither the separation nor sale of the Non-Arriver Business was a condition of the Qualcomm Competing\nProposal and neither would be required to be completed prior to closing of the proposed acquisition of Veoneer.\nOn August 6, 2021, the Board held a meeting at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.\nFollowing discussion, the Board determined to meet again on August 8, 2021, and instructed management and\nVeoneer\u2019s advisors to continue evaluating the Qualcomm Competing Proposal in advance of the Board\u2019s next\nmeeting.\nOn August 8, 2021, the Board held a meeting at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal. After\nreviewing the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and Veoneer\u2019s obligations under the Magna Merger Agreement,\nconsultation with Veoneer\u2019s financial and legal advisors, and discussion, the Board determined, in accordance with\nthe terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal constituted a \u201cCompeting\nProposal\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that such Competing Proposal would reasonably be expected to\nresult in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement) and that the failure to engage with\nQualcomm would be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties to Veoneer\u2019s stockholders. After the meeting, and\nat the direction of the Board, Veoneer issued a press release announcing its intention to engage with Qualcomm in\naccordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement and instructed Skadden to deliver a draft confidentiality\nagreement to Qualcomm\u2019s counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d). Shortly thereafter,\non August, 8, 2021, Veoneer sent a notice to Magna informing it of the Board\u2019s determination in accordance with the\nterms of the Magna Merger Agreement and Veoneer\u2019s intention to engage in negotiations and/or discussion with,\nand furnish information to, Qualcomm. On the same day, Veoneer sent a notice to Qualcomm notifying them of the\nBoard\u2019s determination.\nOn August 11, 2021, Veoneer and Qualcomm entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the\nMagna Merger Agreement) (the \u201cQualcomm NDA\u201d), the terms of which were substantially identical to the terms of\nthe existing Magna NDA, including a standstill provision with customary fallaways and the ability for Qualcomm to\nmake confidential proposals to the Company. Following the execution of the Qualcomm NDA, representatives from\nVeoneer, Qualcomm, and their counsels discussed expectations regarding Qualcomm\u2019s due diligence. Thereafter,\nVeoneer began to provide Qualcomm and its representatives with due diligence access.\nFollowing execution of the Qualcomm NDA, Veoneer provided Qualcomm and its representatives with due diligence\ninformation as permitted by the Magna Merger Agreement, including access to confidential information regarding\nfinancial, legal, tax and intellectual property matters, and holding discussions with representatives of Qualcomm and\nits respective advisors.\nOn August 19, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the\npending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as\nupdating the Board on the due diligence process being pursued by Qualcomm and the potential risk to Veoneer from\nan extended period of uncertainty and devotion of management resources to Qualcomm\u2019s due diligence. The\ndirectors considered ongoing engagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and\ninstructed management to continue to engage with Qualcomm by continuing to provide due diligence access.\nOn August 24, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the\npending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as\nupdating the Board on the due diligence process being pursued by Qualcomm. Representatives of Skadden noted\nthat Qualcomm had not yet provided terms of a proposed merger agreement in connection with its proposal, and\nreviewed for the Board\u2019s consideration potential merger agreement terms for a Qualcomm transaction based on the\nMagna Merger Agreement, but reflecting a limited number of changes, including changes intended to provide\nsubstantial closing certainty in a potential transaction with Qualcomm. The directors considered ongoing\nengagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and instructed management to\ncontinue to engage with Qualcomm by continuing to provide due diligence access and providing to Qualcomm a\nproposed draft merger agreement on the terms discussed, including a regulatory efforts covenant requiring\nQualcomm to take all actions\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnecessary to obtain regulatory approvals and a reverse termination fee if such approvals were not obtained, and no\nclosing condition based on a material adverse effect occurring with respect to Veoneer, in an effort to obtain a\ndetailed, solidified proposal from Qualcomm as promptly as practicable. On the same day, Mr. Carlson wrote to Mr.\nAmon requesting that Qualcomm promptly make a definitive proposal to acquire Veoneer for the Board to consider, if\nit was planning to do so.\nAlso on August 24, 2021, Skadden sent the draft merger agreement to Paul Weiss, and concurrently provided the\ndraft to Sidley in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nThe following week representatives of Veoneer contacted representatives of Magna to inquire whether Magna would\nconsider enhancements at that time to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, including with respect to\nenhanced regulatory efforts requirements and increased price.\nOn September 7, 2021, members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management team took part in a diligence call with senior\npersonnel and other representatives from Qualcomm and SSW to discuss, among other matters, diligence questions\nraised by Qualcomm in connection with the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.\nOn September 8, 2021, Magna, in light of, among other things, uncertainty surrounding the acquisition of Veoneer\nand third-party efforts to recruit certain Veoneer engineers, provided Veoneer with its written consent to increase the\nsize of the employee retention pool from $5 million to $35 million and provided Veoneer with additional flexibility\nregarding the vesting terms for any such payments.\nOn September 9, 2021, Veoneer filed its definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A soliciting stockholder approval for\nthe Magna Merger Agreement, which stated that should Qualcomm provide a complete proposal for the acquisition\nof Veoneer, including a merger agreement, the Board intended to evaluate, in consultation with Veoneer\u2019s financial\nand legal advisors, whether it would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Magna\nMerger Agreement) and, if so, negotiate with Qualcomm and/or Magna, if appropriate, to seek to obtain the best\navailable transaction for Veoneer\u2019s stockholders.\nDuring this period, Qualcomm engaged in discussions with various potential buyers of the Non-Arriver Business\nwho could partner with Qualcomm. Ultimately, Qualcomm entered into advanced discussions with SSW Investors LP\n(\u201cSSW Investors\u201d) regarding a potential acquisition of Veoneer by Qualcomm and SSW Investors. Qualcomm and\nSSW Investors agreed that Qualcomm would lead and control negotiations with Veoneer with respect to such\npotential transaction, in consultation with SSW Investors.\nOn September 10, 2021, Qualcomm sent Veoneer a proposed merger agreement and an investment and separation\nmatters agreement (the \u201cQualcomm September 10 Documents\u201d and such proposal, the \u201cQualcomm September 10\nProposal\u201d). The Qualcomm September 10 Proposal described a transaction pursuant to which (i) SSW would acquire\nVeoneer in a merger for $37.00 per share in cash, (ii) after the closing of the Merger, Qualcomm and SSW would effect\nthe Non-Arriver Extraction in accordance with the terms of the Qualcomm September 10 Documents, with the Merger\nnot being conditioned on Qualcomm and SSW being able to concurrently complete the Non-Arriver Extraction at the\nclosing of the Merger and (iii) following SSW\u2019s acquisition of Veoneer and completion of the Non-Arriver Extraction,\nQualcomm (or its designated affiliate) would acquire Veoneer, which would then hold only the Arriver Business, from\nSSW. The Qualcomm September 10 Proposal, consistent with the Qualcomm Competing Proposal submitted on\nAugust 5, 2021, proposed a regulatory efforts commitment that was consistent with the terms of the Magna Merger\nAgreement, but did not include any of the enhancements previously requested by Veoneer, including the regulatory\nefforts standard, a reverse termination fee and the absence of a closing condition based on a material adverse effect\non Veoneer.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, on September 11, 2021, Veoneer provided notice to\nMagna that it had received the Qualcomm September 10 Documents and provided Magna with copies of the\nQualcomm September 10 Documents.\nOn September 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference to discuss the Qualcomm September 10\nProposal, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild &\nCo and Skadden were present. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the legal matters and the proposed transaction\nstructure and terms proposed by Qualcomm in the Qualcomm September 10 Documents. The Board, after considering\nthe terms of the transaction proposed by Qualcomm, and receiving the advice of Veoneer\u2019s financial and legal\nadvisors, determined that the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior\nProposal (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement). On September 14, 2021, Veoneer provided notice\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto Magna, in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement, that the Board had reached such a\ndetermination. That day, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Qualcomm merger agreement to Paul Weiss, and\nsubsequently on that day shared such draft with Magna as required under the terms of the Magna Merger\nAgreement.\nThroughout this period, Veoneer, Magna and its respective representatives continued to progress regulatory filings\nand cooperate in pursuit of the transactions contemplated by the Magna Merger Agreement. During the same period,\nVeoneer and its representatives continued to facilitate diligence by Qualcomm and its representatives as permitted\nunder the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nOn September 15, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri, on behalf of Magna, delivered a letter by email to Mr. Carlson and the Board in\nwhich he expressed Magna\u2019s concern that Veoneer\u2019s ongoing consideration of the Qualcomm Competing Proposal\nand the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal could result in damage to Veoneer. Magna described certain adjustments it\nwas willing to make to the regulatory covenants of the Magna Merger Agreement that it believed would increase\ncertainty of closing by including an enhanced standard of efforts for Magna to obtain regulatory approval. Magna\ndid not propose an increase to its price per share.\nOn September 16, 2021, representatives of Veoneer, Qualcomm and their counsel held a call regarding the transaction\nstructure proposed by the Qualcomm September 10 Proposal and related matters.\nOn September 20, 2021, Veoneer sent Qualcomm a further revised draft of the merger agreement included with the\nQualcomm September 10 Documents (the \u201cProposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement\u201d), which was provided to\nMagna in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement. On September 21, 2021, Veoneer and\nQualcomm and their counsel held a call to discuss regulatory matters, including how Qualcomm\u2019s proposed\nregulatory approach compared to that of the Magna transaction.\nAlso on September 21, 2021, Veoneer received a communication from a strategic party expressing interest in buying\nVeoneer assets in Asia, but no proposal was subsequently received.\nOn September 22, 2021, Veoneer management provided an update to the Board including with respect to the\ntransaction with Magna, the transaction proposal from Qualcomm and ongoing engagement with Qualcomm to\nfinalize diligence and negotiate improved terms to the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, and discussions with\nMagna regarding enhanced terms to the Magna Merger Agreement. At the meeting, the Board was apprised of the\ncommunication received regarding interest in Veoneer\u2019s Asian business.\nAlso on September 22, 2021, representatives of Veoneer and Qualcomm and their advisors met telephonically and\ndiscussed proposed changes to the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement. On September 23, 2021, representatives\nfrom Skadden and Sidley held a call to discuss certain potential enhancements to the terms of the Magna Merger\nAgreement in response to Qualcomm\u2019s Competing Proposal. That day, Veoneer and Qualcomm\u2019s counsels exchanged\nrevised drafts of the documents related to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, and Veoneer provided Magna with\ncopies of such documents as required under the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nOn September 24, 2021, the Board met to discuss the Qualcomm Competing Proposal, at which time representatives\nfrom Skadden reviewed the terms of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, including how it compared to the\nterms offered by Magna in the Magna Merger Agreement, as well as regulatory considerations with respect to each\ntransaction. The Board instructed management to ask Qualcomm and Magna to each put forward its best offer. On\nSeptember 25, 2021, Skadden sent Magna\u2019s counsel a draft of an amendment to the Magna Merger Agreement.\nAlso on September 25, 2021, Skadden sent revised drafts of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement and draft\ndisclosure schedules to representatives of Paul Weiss and shared the revised documents with Magna\u2019s counsel in\naccordance with the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement.\nThroughout the days of September 26 and September 27, 2021, Veoneer and Qualcomm\u2019s counsel exchanged further\nmarkups of the documents related to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.\nOn September 28, 2021, Mr. Kotagiri sent a letter on behalf of Magna to Mr. Carlson indicating potential proposed\nchanges to the Magna Merger Agreement, including that Magna would be willing to implement under certain\ncircumstances an enhanced standard of efforts for Magna to obtain regulatory approvals\u037e the addition of carve-outs\nto the definition of \u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect\u201d related to adverse deterioration of customer or supplier\nrelationships or employee attrition\u037e and changing the measurement date for the vesting of certain performance-based\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstock awards to the date of such proposed amendment (the \u201cMagna Amendment Proposal\u201d). Magna also indicated\nthat it would be willing to extend financing to Veoneer during the period between the adoption of the Magna Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting and closing, but did not provide the amount or terms of any such financing.\nMagna did not propose an increase to its price per share.\nAlso on September 28, 2021, the Board held a meeting via video conference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior\nmanagement and representatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden updated the Board on the\npending transaction with Magna including progress on regulatory filings and other pre-closing matters, as well as\nupdating the Board on the latest terms of the Magna Amendment Proposal and the Qualcomm Competing Proposal.\nThe directors considered ongoing engagement with Qualcomm with respect to the Qualcomm Competing Proposal,\nand instructed management to continue to engage with Qualcomm and Magna in accordance with the terms of the\nMagna Merger Agreement.\nOn September 29, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of the Proposed Qualcomm Merger\nAgreement to Paul Weiss. Thereafter, Skadden and Paul Weiss exchanged drafts of the documents related to the\nQualcomm Competing Proposal, and Veoneer shared these with Magna in accordance with the terms of the Magna\nMerger Agreement.\nOn September 30, 2021, Mr. Carlson spoke separately with Mr. Amon and Mr. Kotagiri regarding the Qualcomm\nCompeting Proposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal, respectively, asking that Qualcomm and Magna each\nconfirm that Veoneer had received their best offers, including with respect to price, so that Mr. Carlson could ensure\nthat the Board had the best information available as it considered the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and the Magna\nAmendment Proposal. During Mr. Carlson\u2019s discussions with Mr. Kotagiri, Mr. Kotagiri indicated that Magna would\nlikely not be willing to increase its proposed price to a level that would be competitive with the price offered in the\nQualcomm Competing Proposal.\nOn October 1, 2021, Veoneer and SSW held a call as part of Veoneer\u2019s diligence on SSW.\nOn October 2, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing\nProposal, which Paul Weiss had confirmed was being signed by Qualcomm and SSW substantially\ncontemporaneously with Veoneer\u2019s Board meeting and thus would be binding on Qualcomm and SSW, and the\nMagna Amendment Proposal and the uncertainty around whether Magna would be willing to increase its proposed\nprice to a level that would be competitive. Representatives from Skadden reviewed legal matters, the key terms of the\nMagna Merger Agreement, the Magna Amendment Proposal and the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement and\nthe key terms of the investment and separation matters agreement and ancillary agreements included with the\nQualcomm Competing Proposal and noted for the Board the resolution of previously open points that had been\nreviewed by the Board at prior meetings. The directors discussed the terms of each proposed transaction, the\nuncertainty around whether Magna would be willing to increase its proposed price to a level that would be\ncompetitive, Veoneer\u2019s prospects and other related matters. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co\nreviewed their respective financial analyses of each proposed transaction.\nOn October 2 and 3, 2021, at the direction of Veoneer and Magna, representatives from Skadden and Sidley discussed\nthe possibility of Magna waiving its right to negotiate adjustments to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement\nduring the Notice Period (as defined in the Magna Merger Agreement) and prepared documentation to memorialize\nsuch a waiver to the extent Magna determined to waive its rights in accordance with the terms of the Magna Merger\nAgreement.\nOn October 3, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present, to discuss the Qualcomm Competing\nProposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal. Skadden reviewed with the Board certain legal matters and the terms\nof the Proposed Qualcomm Merger Agreement, the Magna Merger Agreement and the Magna Amendment Proposal.\nThe directors discussed the terms of each proposed transaction, Veoneer\u2019s prospects and other related matters.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of each\nproposed transaction. On October 3, 2021, Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley each sent Veoneer updated versions\nof the Rothschild Relationship Disclosure and the Morgan Stanley Relationship Disclosure, respectively, including\nwith respect to SSW, which were provided to the Board. Following discussion, the Board requested that Mr. Carlson\nagain seek to confirm whether Magna would increase its proposed price to be competitive, or, if not, alternatively,\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto confirm that Magna would waive its right to negotiate adjustments to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement\nduring the Notice Period to permit Veoneer to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement if the Board were to determine\nthat the Qualcomm Competing Proposal to be a Superior Proposal.\nOn October 4, 2021, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Kotagiri, had a call to discuss the Board\u2019s consideration of the proposed\ntransaction with Qualcomm during which Mr. Kotagiri did not propose an increase in the price offered by Magna and\nindicated that if the Board determined that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal was a Superior Proposal, Magna\nwould waive its right to negotiate adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Magna Merger Agreement during the\nNotice Period and execute a waiver of those rights pursuant to the waiver agreement previously prepared by Skadden\nand Sidley.\nOn October 4, 2021, the Board held a videoconference, at which members of Veoneer\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co and Skadden were present. Skadden reviewed legal matters and\nproposed terms of the Merger Agreement, the Magna Merger Agreement and the Magna Amendment Proposal.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Rothschild & Co reviewed their respective financial analyses of each\nproposed transaction, and each rendered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its\nrespective written opinion to the Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject\nto the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth in such written opinion, the Merger Consideration payable\nto the holders of shares of Veoneer Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The directors discussed the terms of each\nof the Qualcomm Competing Proposal and the Magna Amendment Proposal, and compared the terms, structure,\nregulatory features and other aspects of the two alternatives, Veoneer\u2019s business and prospects, and other matters.\nAfter discussing the proposed transaction and considering the presentations by Skadden, Morgan Stanley and\nRothschild & Co, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Qualcomm Competing Proposal constituted a\nSuperior Proposal under the Magna Merger Agreement and that failure to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement\nand approve Veoneer\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties to\nVeoneer\u2019s stockholders under applicable law, (ii) determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions set\nforth in the Magna Merger Agreement, it intended to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement and approve Veoneer\u2019s\nentry into the Merger Agreement and (iii) instructed Skadden to provide Magna with written notice of the Board\u2019s\ndetermination and termination intentions. At the direction of the Board, Skadden delivered written notice to Magna of\nthe Board\u2019s intention to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement and approve Veoneer\u2019s entry into the Merger\nAgreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Magna Merger Agreement. Concurrently\nwith the delivery of written notice from Skadden to Magna, Magna waived its right to negotiate any adjustments to\nthe terms and conditions of the Magna Merger Agreement with Veoneer. Thereafter, the Board unanimously (i)\nauthorized Veoneer to terminate the Magna Merger Agreement, enter into the Merger Agreement and require that\nQualcomm pay the $110,000,000 termination fee to Magna in connection with the termination of the Magna Merger\nAgreement, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Veoneer and its stockholders, (iii) approved the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and (iv) resolved to\nrecommend that the stockholders of Veoneer vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and\nthe transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nAt the direction of the Board, Skadden delivered written notice to Magna terminating the Magna Merger Agreement,\nand Qualcomm concurrently caused to be paid to Magna the $110,000,000 termination fee in satisfaction of Veoneer\u2019s\nobligations under the Magna Merger Agreement. Immediately following the termination of the Magna Merger\nAgreement, Veoneer, Qualcomm and SSW executed the Merger Agreement on October 4, 2021, and shortly thereafter,\nVeoneer, Qualcomm and SSW issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.",

For purposes of the\nChange in Control Agreements, the Merger will constitute a change in control of the Company. The Change in\nControl Agreements generally provide that if the executive is terminated from employment by Veoneer without cause\nor the executive terminates his employment with good reason, in either case, within two (2) years following the\nChange in Control Date (among certain other qualifying terminations), then the named executive officer will receive:\n\u2022\nA lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to two and a half (2.5) times (for Mr. Carlson) or one\nand a half (1.5) times (for Mr. Sj\u00f6bring) the sum of the executive\u2019s (x) base salary as in effect immediately\nprior to the termination date, or if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or\ncircumstance constituting good reason, plus (y) the average of the annual cash bonuses earned for the two\n(2) fiscal years prior to the year in which termination occurs, or if higher, the bonus payable for the fiscal\nyear immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting good reason, plus (z)\ntaxable value of the car and pension benefits such executive would have been entitled to had he remained\nemployed for a period of one year following the termination.\n\u2022\nPayment by the Company of all relevant social costs attributable to the severance payment described\nabove.\nVeoneer has entered into employment agreements with the fifteen (15) individuals who are treated as executive\nofficers for purposes of this Proxy Statement, including the named executive officers (the \u201cEmployment\nAgreements\u201d). The Employment Agreements (other than the agreement with Mr. Carlson, which is superseded by his\nChange in Control Agreement) that contain entitlements to severance generally provide that if the executive is\nterminated from employment by Veoneer other than for cause or the executive terminates his employment with good\nreason (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreements) during the term of the Employment Agreement,\nthen the executive officer will receive a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to one and a half (1.5) times\n(or in a certain case, one (1) times) the executive\u2019s base salary. The Company is also in certain cases obligated to pay\nall relevant social costs attributable to the lump sum severance payment. Certain executives may also become entitled\nto a payment in respect of the non-competition restrictions set forth in the executive\u2019s Employment Agreement, if any,\nof up to twelve (12) monthly payments equal to the difference between the executive\u2019s monthly base salary (or in the\ncase of Mr. Carlson, gross salary) as in effect on the date of termination, and the monthly salary earned in any new\nemployment, with the maximum payments limited to 60% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary (or in the case\nof Mr. Carlson, gross salary) as of the date of such termination. Under the Employment Agreements, the executive\nofficer is entitled to receive six (6) months\u2019 notice of termination by the Company (in the case of Mr. Carlson pursuant\nto his Change in Control Agreement, such six months\u2019 notice is provided), other than in the event of a termination by\nthe Company for cause. Payments under the Change in Control Agreements are in lieu of the salary and benefits\npayments during the requisite notice period and severance payments under an individual\u2019s Employment Agreement\nare not applicable if the executive officer is entitled to payments under such individual\u2019s Change in Control\nAgreement. The Acquiring Parties and the Company have agreed that the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer and General Counsel will have good reason to resign under their respective Change in Control\nAgreement or Employment Agreement following the closing, subject to their continued employment through closing.\nThe provision of severance payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s\nexecution of a release of claims. The Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Sj\u00f6bring further provides that if he\nreceives any amount that is subject to the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 280G and 4999\nof the Tax Code, the amount of the payments to be made pursuant to the Change in Control Agreement will be\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of the excise tax, but only if the after-tax amount of the reduced\npayments exceeds the after-tax amount that he would receive without any such reduction following imposition of the\nexcise tax and all income and related taxes.\nSee the section entitled \u201cInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Veoneer in the Merger-Golden\nParachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would\nbecome payable to each Veoneer named executive officer under his or her respective Change in Control Agreement or\nEmployment Agreement upon a termination of employment without cause or for good reason as of the Change in\nControl Date. See also the section entitled \u201cQuantification of Non-Equity Interests of Executive Officers Other than\nthe Named Executive Officers\u201d beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that\nwould become payable to each Veoneer executive officer for purposes of this Proxy Statement other than the named\nexecutive officers under the officer\u2019s Employment Agreement.\nNon-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan\nVeoneer maintains the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan (the \u201cNon-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan\u201d),\npursuant to which participants may elect to defer a stated percentage of their eligible compensation for each plan\nyear\u037e provided, however, the amount deferred may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of a participant\u2019s eligible\ncompensation. Earnings (and losses) are credited to participants\u2019 accounts based on participant choices between\nvarious investment options and the rate of return determined by the administrative committee of the plan. Participants\nare eligible to receive matching contributions equal to eighty percent (80%) of their deferred amounts\u037e provided that\ndeferred amounts in excess of seven percent (7%) of the participant\u2019s eligible compensation for the period in question\nare not eligible for matching contributions.\nParticipants are always one hundred percent (100%) vested in their deferred amounts and earnings thereon\u037e however,\nmatching contributions and earnings thereon in a participant\u2019s account are subject to forfeiture in the extraordinary\ncircumstance that the participant is determined by the Board to have stolen Company assets, violated Veoneer\u2019s\nStandards of Business Conduct and Ethics or disclosed confidential business or technical information of Veoneer to\nunauthorized third parties. A change in control of the Company is a distribution event for purposes of the Non-\nQualified Retirement Savings Plan. Accordingly, in connection with the Merger, the administrative committee of the\nNon-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan will distribute the accounts of plan participants, with payments to be made in\na single lump sum payment within sixty (60) days following the Change in Control Date.\nPossible Compensation Arrangements with the Acquiring Parties\nAs of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of Veoneer\u2019s executive officers have entered into any agreement with the\nAcquiring Parties or any of their affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the\nequity of, the Acquiring Parties, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of their affiliates. Prior to, or following the\nclosing of the Merger, however, some or all of Veoneer\u2019s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with\nthe Acquiring Parties regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the\nAcquiring Parties or one or more of their affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation).\nPermitted Retention Plan\nVeoneer may adopt a retention plan prior to the consummation of the Merger where the amount payable under such\nplan, in the aggregate, does not exceed $35,000,000. Retention payments under this program are permitted to be paid\neither (A) with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the recipient\u2019s aggregate retention amount by Veoneer on the first\npayroll date following each of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date or (B)\nwith respect to 100% of the recipient\u2019s aggregate retention amount on the first payroll date following the sixtieth\n(60th) day following the Closing Date (each, a \u201cRetention Vesting Date\u201d) based on continued employment on the\napplicable Retention Vesting Date. Payment of the retention awards may be accelerated in the event that a recipient\u2019s\nemployment is terminated by Veoneer without cause, subject to the recipient\u2019s execution of an effective general\nrelease of claims in Veoneer\u2019s standard form. As of the date hereof, it is not known whether any named executive\nofficer or other executive officer of Veoneer will receive a permitted retention award, and no executive officer has yet\nbeen granted a retention award.\nQuantification of Non-Equity Interests of Executive Officers Other than the Named Executive Officers\nThe table below shows the estimated amounts that each Veoneer executive officer (including officers who are no\nlonger deemed to serve as executive officers of the Company but who have served in such capacity at any time since\nthe beginning of Veoneer\u2019s last fiscal year), other than the named executive officers, would receive upon a\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntermination of employment without cause or through resignation for good reason assuming that such events\noccurred on the Change in Control Date. All accounts under the Company\u2019s Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan\nare fully vested and accordingly, the Merger will not result in accelerated vesting under the plan for any executive\nofficer that participates in the plan. For purposes of this Proxy Statement, an individual who is no longer deemed to\nserve as an executive officer of the Company but who has served in such capacity at any time since the beginning of\nVeoneer\u2019s last fiscal year, is listed as a former executive officer in the table below.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on the assumptions set forth in the section entitled\n\u201cGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d on page 82 of this Proxy Statement. The assumptions may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, and do not\ninclude any equity award grants that may be made after the date hereof and prior to the assumed effective time of\nDecember 30, 2022 (or any later effective time). The table omits Arthur Blanchford, the Company's former EVP, Sales\nand Business Development, who ceased to serve as an executive officer as of May 1, 2021, but remained in his officer\nrole until he ceased to be employed with the Company on October 15, 2021.

For additional details regarding the terms of the\npayments and benefits described below, see the discussion under \u201cInterests of the Directors and Executive Officers\nof Veoneer in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 76 of this Proxy Statement, which is incorporated herein.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, including\nany equity award grants that may be made after the assumed effective time of December 30, 2022.

Represents severance payable to each named executive officer upon a termination of employment by Veoneer without\ncause or by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, pursuant to the named executive officer\u2019s Change in\nControl Severance Agreement or Employment Agreement, as applicable, consisting of a lump sum payment reflecting a\nmultiplier of (x) in the case of the Change in Control Severance Agreements for Messrs. Carlson and Sj\u00f6bring, the sum of base\nsalary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date, or if higher, in effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of\nan event or circumstance constituting good reason\u037e the\n82\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naverage of the annual cash bonuses earned for the two (2) fiscal years prior to year in which termination occurs, or if higher, the\nbonus payable for the fiscal year immediately prior to the first occurrence of an event or circumstance constituting good reason\u037e\nand the taxable value of certain car and pension benefits, or (y) base salary in the case of Matthias Bieler pursuant to his\nemployment agreement. With respect to each executive these multipliers are as follows: Mr. Jan Carlson (2.5), Mr. Sj\u00f6bring (1.5)\nand Mr. Bieler (1.5). The cash figure for each of the named executive officers includes a pro rata payment of the executive\u2019s\ntarget annual incentive (and, given the assumed Change in Control Date of December 30, 2022, the figures reflect the payment\nof a full year\u2019s bonus). The cash figure for Mr. Bieler also includes an estimated payment in consideration for a 12-month non-\ncompetition covenant as provided by his Employment Agreement and described in more detail below. Each named executive\nofficer\u2019s severance payments constitute \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payments under the assumptions stated above, which means that the\namounts will be triggered by a change in control but conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment. In the case of\nMessrs. Carlson and Sj\u00f6bring, the severance becomes payable if (A) the qualifying termination of employment occurs within the\ntwo (2) years following the Change in Control Date or (B) in the event that the qualifying termination of employment by the\nCompany (or the event constituting good reason for termination by Mr. Carlson) occurs prior to a change in control at the\nrequest or direction of the acquiror who has entered into an agreement with Veoneer, the consummation of which would\nconstitute a change in control, or under circumstances in connection with or in anticipation of a change in control, whether or\nnot the change in control occurs. The Acquiring Parties and the Company have agreed that Messrs. Carlson and Sj\u00f6bring will\nhave good reason to resign under their respective Change in Control Severance Agreements following the closing, subject to their\ncontinued employment through closing.

Such payment would be made in up to 12 monthly installments.\nThe salary differential payment in consideration for the non-competition covenant is contingent on the executive\nofficer\u2019s compliance with the terms and conditions of the covenant.\n(2)\nEquity. Represents the value of the unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs (in each case, inclusive of dividend equivalent\nunits credited thereon) held by each named executive officer as of the Change in Control Date. The amounts payable in respect\nof the unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs at the Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of the Merger\nAgreement are \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payments, which means that the amounts will become payable solely as a result of continued\nemployment through the Effective Time. All Company Options held by the named executive officers are fully vested as of the\ndate hereof and are not subject to acceleration under the Merger Agreement. Consequently, amounts payable in respect of\nCompany Options are not \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payments and are therefore excluded from the following table.

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period under the HSR\nAct has expired or been terminated. Consummation of the Merger is also conditioned on approvals being obtained or\napplicable waiting periods having expired or been terminated pursuant to the investment screening laws of France,\nGermany and Italy, and no governmental authority of the United States, the People\u2019s Republic of China, France,\nGermany or Italy having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect\nand has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger.\nWe currently expect to obtain all antitrust and other regulatory approvals that are required for the completion of the\nMerger in 2022.\nVeoneer made the filing required under the HSR Act on October 20, 2021, and will make the filings required under the\ninvestment screening laws of France, Germany and Italy, as applicable, promptly pursuant to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59 p.m. on November 19, 2021.\nHSR Act\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the\nMerger cannot be consummated until Veoneer and the Acquiring Parties each file a notification and report form with\nthe FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act and the\napplicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.\n86TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC or any other non-U.S. regulatory body could take such\naction under the antitrust or competition laws as such regulators may deem necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the\nparties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual\nrights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, any state, or the equivalent under the Council Regulation or non-U.S. regulatory bodies\ncould take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action\ncould include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the\nparties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nInvestment Screening Laws\nConsummation of the Merger is conditioned on approvals being obtained or applicable waiting periods having\nexpired or been terminated pursuant to the investment screening laws of France, Germany and Italy.\nUnder France\u2019s foreign investment control regime, set out in the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code\nMon\u00e9taire et Financier), foreign investors must file a request with, and obtain prior authorization from, the Ministry of\nEconomy and Finance (MINEFI) for certain investments in certain strategic or sensitive sectors. During the initial\nthirty (30) business day review period, MINEFI may indicate whether a transaction falls within or outside the scope\nof the control, requires a further analysis, or is cleared. MINEFI has the option of extending the review by an\nadditional forty five (45) business days.\nLikewise, under Germany\u2019s foreign investment regime, set out in the German Foreign Trade and Payment Act\n( A u \u00df e n w i r t s c h a f t s g e s e t z  -  A W G )  a n d  t h e  G e r m a n  F o r e i g n  T r a d e  a n d  P a y m e n t  O r d i n a n c e\n(Au\u00dfenwirtschaftsverordnung - AWV), filings are mandatory for certain investments in strategic sectors. In other\ncases, filing is voluntary, and, if the applicant elects to file, it will apply for the issuance of a certificate of non-\nobjection. The Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has two (2) months in which to conduct an initial\nreview. If it has not opened a formal review within that time period the investment is deemed approved. If it opens a\nformal review, the BMWi has four (4) months in which to conclude the review proceedings. This time limit is\nsuspended while the parties and the BMWi are engaged in negotiating a mitigation agreement. In certain cases, the\nBMWi may extend the formal review period by up to an additional four (4) months.\nUnder Italy\u2019s foreign investment regime, set out in Law Decree No. 21 of 15 March 2012 (Decreto-Legge 15 marzo\n2012, n. 21), passed by Italian Law No. 56 of 11 May 2012 (Legge 11 maggio 2012, n. 56) (as subsequently amended\nand enacted, together with all connected or subordinated implementing decrees and regulations in force - so-called\nGolden Powers Legislation), filings are mandatory for certain investments in strategic sectors. The review period is\nforty five (45) days, which can be extended if additional information is needed from the filer or a third party, or in the\ncontext of the EU cooperation mechanism.\nIt is possible that one or more governmental agencies may, as a result of the review, impose a condition, restriction,\nqualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also\nseek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals. We anticipate that\nall required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained. However, there are no assurances as to the\ntimeliness of obtaining these clearances, that all regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained or that the\ngranting of these regulatory clearances and approvals would not involve any additional conditions on the\nconsummation of the Merger.",

The complaints each allege\nthat the preliminary Proxy Statement issued in connection with the proposed Merger between Veoneer and Qualcomm\nomitted material information which rendered the preliminary Proxy Statement incomplete and misleading. Specifically,\nthe complaints allege that the preliminary Proxy Statement failed to disclose material information regarding Veoneer\u2019s\nfinancial projections, Rothschild\u2019s and Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analyses, and additional information regarding\nprior work Morgan Stanley performed for Veoneer and Qualcomm.\n87TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach complaint seeks, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction unless and until additional disclosures\nare issued\u037e and, if the Merger closes, damages. The defendants believe the complaints are without merit. It is possible\nadditional lawsuits may be filed between the date of this Proxy Statement and consummation of the Merger.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay\nconsummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Veoneer, including any costs associated with the\nindemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ngovernmental authority in the U.S. or other specified foreign jurisdictions shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,\nenforced or entered any law or order which is then in effect and has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering\nillegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an\ninjunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent\nthe Merger from being consummated, or from being consummated within the expected time frame.",

The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and\ndoes not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. Only a holder of record of shares of Veoneer Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the\nshares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Veoneer Common Stock\nheld of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the\nrecord holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you\nhold your shares of Veoneer Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise\nappraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other nominee.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of Veoneer Common Stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective date of the\nMerger, and (iii) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have their\nshares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the Merger\nConsideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation\nof the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Court\nof Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving\nCorporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from\nthe effective date of the Merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e provided that, if at any\ntime before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to\neach stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on\nthe amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nshares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary\npayment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash\npayment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair\nvalue of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than\nthe $37.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal\nof their shares.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its\nstockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section\n262 of the DGCL. This Proxy Statement constitutes Veoneer\u2019s notice to Veoneer Stockholders that appraisal rights are\navailable in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this Proxy\nStatement as Annex B. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so should review Annex B carefully.\nFailure to fully comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in\nthe loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as\nto all Veoneer Stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Veoneer Common\nStock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding\nshares of Veoneer Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the\nvalue of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock for which appraisal\nrights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for\nexercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Veoneer Common Stock, Veoneer believes that if a Veoneer\nStockholder is\n118TABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsidering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A stockholder who\nloses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as described in the Merger\nAgreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented such shares of Veoneer Common Stock.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Veoneer Common Stock must fully\ncomply with Section 262 of the DGCL, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Veoneer a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares\nbefore the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date\nof the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of\ndoing so.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should\nnot return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not\nvote its shares.",

A beneficial\nowner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own\nname, file a petition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nThe Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders\nshould not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair values of shares of Veoneer Common Stock. Accordingly, any Veoneer Stockholders who desire to have their\nshares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for\nappraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a Veoneer\nStockholder to file such a petition for appraisal within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL will nullify the\nstockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the Merger, any Veoneer Stockholder who has\ncomplied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nSurviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the Merger\nproposal and with respect to which Veoneer received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch Veoneer Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder\nwithin ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration\nof the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Veoneer Stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with\n120TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who\nhave demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been\nreached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who\nhave become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who\ndemanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon\nof the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of\nChancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.",

        "Section Header": "Determination of Fair Value",
        "Section Text": "Determination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Veoneer Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will appraise the\n\u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Veoneer Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to\nbe the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which\nare generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be\nconsidered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware\nstated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which\nrather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,\nmay be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on\nfactual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to\nthe Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not\nin any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Veoneer believes that the Merger\nConsideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the\nCourt of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a\nvalue higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Veoneer nor the Acquiring Parties\nanticipate offering more than the $37.00 per share Merger Consideration to any Veoneer Stockholder exercising\nappraisal rights. Each of Veoneer and the Acquiring Parties reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding,\nthat for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Veoneer Common Stock is less than the\n$37.00 per share Merger Consideration.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective\nTime through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%)\nover the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e provided that if at any time before\nthe Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the\namount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares\nas determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,\nunless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment\nprior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the\nfees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court\n121TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\nalso order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Veoneer Common Stock under Section 262 of the\nDGCL fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of\nVeoneer Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the Merger Consideration,\nless applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right\nto appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date of the\nMerger or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nFrom and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to\nvote Veoneer Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock,\nexcept dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Veoneer Common Stock, if any, payable to Veoneer\nStockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal\nis filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with\nthe written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once\na petition for appraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as\nto any Veoneer Stockholder without the approval of the court\u037e provided, however, this sentence shall not affect the\nright of any holder of shares of Veoneer Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined\nthat proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered\nupon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.\nFailure to comply fully with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a\nstockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Veoneer Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights\nis encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n122\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",
