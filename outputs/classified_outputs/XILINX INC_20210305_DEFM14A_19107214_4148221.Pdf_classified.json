The merger cannot be\ncompleted unless the AMD share issuance proposal is approved by AMD stockholders and the Xilinx merger\nproposal is approved by Xilinx stockholders.\nAMD\nAMD Share Issuance Proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval\nof the AMD share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\nissued and outstanding shares of AMD common stock that are virtually present via the AMD special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the\nAMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy\n(including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a\nbank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee)\nwill have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An abstention or other\nfailure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD\nspecial meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal. However,\nassuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares\nin \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or\nmore other proposals, but not for the AMD share issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be\nwithheld with respect to the AMD share issuance proposal and such failure to provide voting\ninstructions will have no effect on the AMD share issuance proposal.\nAMD Adjournment Proposal.

Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by\nproxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through\na bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee)\nwill have no effect on the outcome of the AMD adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure\nof any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special\nmeeting on the\n2 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAMD adjournment proposal to vote on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares\nin \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more\nother proposals, but not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld\nwith respect to the AMD adjournment proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will\nhave no effect on the AMD adjournment proposal.\nXilinx\nXilinx merger proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the\nXilinx merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx\nmerger proposal. The failure to vote by proxy or to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special\nmeeting, including an abstention, will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx merger\nproposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting).\nXilinx compensation proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval\nof the Xilinx compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\nissued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. The failure\nto vote by proxy and to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting will have no effect on\nthe Xilinx compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting).\nAccordingly, assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, any shares not virtually\npresent or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares\nin \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,\nbroker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Xilinx compensation proposal. An\nabstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote\nat the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the Xilinx compensation proposal will have the same effect as\na vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one\nor more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal, it will have the same effect as\na vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal.\nXilinx adjournment proposal.

An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx adjournment\nproposal to vote on the Xilinx adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Xilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other\nproposals, but not for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nWhat will Xilinx stockholders receive for their shares of Xilinx common stock if the merger is completed?\nIf the merger is completed, each share of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock, which number is\nreferred to as the \u201cexchange ratio.\u201d Each Xilinx stockholder will receive cash (without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock that such Xilinx\n3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstockholder would otherwise receive in the merger. Any cash amounts to be received by a Xilinx stockholder\nin lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock will be rounded to the nearest whole cent.\nBecause AMD will issue a fixed number of shares of AMD common stock in exchange for each share of Xilinx\ncommon stock, the value of the merger consideration that Xilinx stockholders will receive in the merger will\ndepend on the market price of shares of AMD common stock at the time the merger is completed. The market\nprice of shares of AMD common stock that Xilinx stockholders receive at the time the merger is completed\ncould be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of shares of AMD common stock on the date\nof this joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the times of the AMD and Xilinx special meetings. Accordingly,\nyou should obtain current market quotations for AMD common stock and Xilinx common stock before\ndeciding how to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal and the Xilinx merger proposal, as applicable.\nAMD and Xilinx common stock are traded on Nasdaq, under the symbols \u201cAMD\u201d and \u201cXLNX,\u201d respectively.\nShares of common stock of the combined company will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cAMD\u201d after\ncompletion of the merger. For more information regarding the merger consideration to be received by Xilinx\nstockholders if the merger is completed, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Merger Consideration.\u201d\nHow does the AMD board of directors recommend that I vote at the AMD special meeting?\nThe AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD share issuance\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD adjournment proposal.\nOther than with respect to continued service for, employment by and the right to continued indemnification by\nthe combined company, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AMD directors and executive\nofficers do not have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other\nAMD stockholders generally. See \u201cInterests of AMD Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nHow does the Xilinx board of directors recommend that I vote at the Xilinx special meeting?\nThe Xilinx board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx merger proposal,\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nIn considering the recommendations of the Xilinx board of directors, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that\nXilinx directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,\ntheir interests as Xilinx stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the payment of\nseverance benefits and acceleration of outstanding Xilinx equity awards upon certain terminations of\nemployment or service, and the combined company\u2019s agreement to indemnify Xilinx directors and executive\nofficers against certain claims and liabilities. For a more complete description of these interests, see \u201cInterests\nof Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nWho is entitled to vote at each special meeting?\nAMD\nAll holders of record of shares of AMD common stock who held shares at the close of business on February\n10, 2021 (the AMD record date) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the AMD special meeting.\nEach such holder of AMD common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before\nthe AMD special meeting for each share of AMD common stock that such holder owned of record as of the\nAMD record date.

All of the\nproposals currently expected to be brought before the AMD and Xilinx special meetings are \u201cnon-routine\u201d\nmatters under Nasdaq rules.\nA \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to\nvote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on\nother proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails\nto provide the bank, broker or other nominee with such instructions. Because all of the proposals currently\nexpected to be voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special meetings are non-routine matters under Nasdaq rules\nfor which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, AMD and Xilinx do not expect there to be any\nbroker non-votes at the AMD or Xilinx special meetings.\nWhat stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the AMD special meeting? What will happen if I\nfail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the AMD special meeting?\nAMD Proposal 1: AMD Share Issuance Proposal\nAssuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD share issuance proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD\ncommon stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal. Accordingly, any shares\nnot virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,\nbroker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD share issuance proposal. An\nabstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the\nAMD special meeting on the AMD share issuance proposal to vote on the AMD share issuance proposal will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal. However, assuming a quorum is\npresent at the AMD special meeting, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a\nbank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the\nAMD share issuance proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD share\nissuance proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD share\nissuance proposal.\nAMD Proposal 2: AMD Adjournment Proposal\nWhether or not a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting, approval of the AMD adjournment proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of AMD\ncommon stock that are virtually present via the AMD special meeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on the AMD adjournment proposal. Accordingly, any shares not\nvirtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of an AMD stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank,\nbroker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the AMD adjournment proposal. An abstention\nor other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the AMD special\nmeeting on the AMD\n7 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nadjournment proposal to vote on the AMD adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD adjournment proposal. However, if an AMD stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals,\nbut not for the AMD adjournment proposal, voting power will deemed to be withheld with respect to the AMD\nadjournment proposal and such failure to provide voting instructions will have no effect on the AMD\nadjournment proposal.\nWhat stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the Xilinx special meeting? What will happen if I\nfail to vote or abstain from voting on each proposal at the Xilinx special meeting?\nXilinx Proposal 1: Xilinx Merger Proposal\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx merger proposal requires\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting on the Xilinx merger proposal. Accordingly, an abstention or\nother failure to vote on the Xilinx merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx\nmerger proposal.\nXilinx Proposal 2: Xilinx Compensation Proposal\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx compensation proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx\ncommon stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special\nmeeting, any shares not virtually present or represented by proxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx\nstockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee to provide voting\ninstructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no effect on the outcome of the Xilinx\ncompensation proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares virtually present or represented by proxy\nand entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the Xilinx compensation proposal will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who\nholds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or\nmore other proposals, but not for the Xilinx compensation proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal.\nXilinx Proposal 3: Xilinx Adjournment Proposal\nWhether or not a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting, approval of the Xilinx adjournment proposal\nrequires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx\ncommon stock that are virtually present via the Xilinx special meeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, any shares not virtually present or represented by\nproxy (including due to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such bank, broker or other nominee) will have no\neffect on the outcome of the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An abstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting to vote on the\nXilinx adjournment proposal will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nIn addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee\nprovides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, the merger-related\ncompensation for Xilinx named executive officers (the Xilinx compensation proposal)?\nUnder SEC rules, Xilinx is required to seek a non-binding advisory vote of its stockholders relating to the\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to Xilinx named executive officers that is based on or\notherwise relates to the merger (also known as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation).\n8 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat happens if Xilinx stockholders do not approve, by non-binding advisory vote, the merger-related compensation for\nXilinx named executive officers (the Xilinx compensation proposal)?\nBecause the vote on the proposal to approve the Xilinx compensation proposal is advisory in nature, the\noutcome of the vote will not be binding upon Xilinx or the combined company. Accordingly, the merger-related\ncompensation, which is described under \u201cInterests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,\u201d\nmay be paid to Xilinx named executive officers even if Xilinx stockholders do not approve the Xilinx\ncompensation proposal.\nWhat if I hold shares of both AMD and Xilinx common stock?\nIf you are both an AMD stockholder and a Xilinx stockholder, you will receive two separate packages of proxy\nmaterials. A vote cast as an AMD stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a Xilinx stockholder, and a vote\ncast as a Xilinx stockholder will not count as a vote cast as an AMD stockholder. Therefore, please follow the\ninstructions received with each set of materials you receive in order to submit separate proxies for your shares of AMD\ncommon stock and your shares of Xilinx common stock.\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d?\nIf your shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of\nAMD and Xilinx, respectively, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As\nthe stockholder of record, you have the right to vote directly at the applicable special meeting. You may also\ngrant a proxy directly to AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, or to a third party to vote your shares at the applicable\nspecial meeting.\nIf your shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are\nconsidered the beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Your bank, broker or other nominee will send\nyou, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedures for voting your shares. You should follow\nthe instructions provided by them to vote your shares. In order to virtually attend and vote at the AMD\nspecial meeting via the AMD special meeting website or the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website, you will need to obtain a specific control number and follow the other procedures provided\nby your bank, broker or other nominee.\nIf my shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my\nbank, broker or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me?\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of AMD or Xilinx common\nstock, as applicable, if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the\nprocedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares. Under\nNasdaq rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d for their customers have authority to vote on \u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received\ninstructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are prohibited from\nexercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters, which include all the proposals\ncurrently scheduled to be considered and voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special meetings. As a result,\nabsent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokers and other nominees are\nnot empowered to vote such shares.\nFor AMD stockholders, the effect of not instructing your bank, broker or other nominee how you wish to vote\nyour shares of AMD common stock will have no effect on the AMD share issuance proposal or the AMD\nadjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting).\nFor Xilinx stockholders, the effect of not instructing your bank, broker or other nominee how you wish to vote\nyour shares of Xilinx common stock will be the same as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx merger proposal, but will\nhave no effect on the Xilinx compensation proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx special\nmeeting) or the Xilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet\nname\u201d\n9 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthrough a bank, broker or other nominee provides voting instructions for one or more other proposals, but not\nfor the Xilinx compensation proposal or the Xilinx adjournment proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d such proposal.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the same special meeting?\nIf you hold shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and also directly in your name as a\nstockholder of record or otherwise, or if you hold shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock in more than one\nbrokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the same special\nmeeting.\nRecord Holders.

For each item before\nthe AMD or Xilinx special meeting, as applicable, you may specify whether your shares of AMD or Xilinx\ncommon stock, as applicable, should be voted for or against, or abstain from voting.\nHow will my shares of AMD common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of AMD common stock\nto be voted, then your shares of AMD common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of\nthe AMD board of directors: \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD adjournment\nproposal.\nHow will my shares of Xilinx common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of Xilinx common stock\nto be voted, then your shares of Xilinx common stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of\nthe Xilinx board of directors: \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?\nAny AMD or Xilinx stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy and change their vote before\nthe proxy is voted at the applicable special meeting by doing any of the following:\nsubsequently submitting a new proxy (including over the internet or telephone) for the applicable\nspecial meeting that is received by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy card\u037e\ngiving written notice of your revocation to AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s Corporate Secretary, as applicable\u037e or\nvirtually attending and voting at the applicable special meeting via the applicable special meeting\nwebsite.\n10 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExecution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to virtually attend and vote at the\napplicable special meeting via the applicable special meeting website.

If Xilinx stockholders\nare not in favor of the merger, they may vote against or choose to abstain from voting on the Xilinx merger\nproposal. See \u201cNo Appraisal Rights.\u201d Information about how Xilinx stockholders may vote on the proposals\nbeing considered in connection with the merger can be found under \u201cThe Xilinx Special Meeting.\u201d\nAre there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the AMD share issuance\nproposal or the Xilinx merger proposal?\nYes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d You also should\nread and carefully consider the risk factors relating to AMD and Xilinx that are contained in the documents\nthat are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock after the respective record date but before the\nrespective special meeting?\nThe AMD record date is earlier than the date of the AMD special meeting, and the Xilinx record date is earlier\nthan the date of the Xilinx special meeting.

AMD estimates that it will pay Mackenzie Partners a fee\nof approximately $60,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses.

However, neither AMD nor Xilinx can predict\nthe actual date on which the merger will be completed, or if the merger will be completed at all, because\ncompletion of the merger is subject to conditions and factors beyond the control of both companies, including\nthe receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.

At the meeting of the\nXilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently\nconfirmed in writing, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review\nundertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger\nagreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock (other than\nshares of Xilinx common stock held in treasury or held by AMD or Merger Sub, which are referred to as the\n\u201cExcluded Shares\u201d).\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of October 26, 2020, which sets forth, among other\nthings, the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on\nthe scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex D hereto. You are\nencouraged to read the entire opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was rendered for the\nbenefit of the Xilinx board of directors, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of\nview of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement to the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock (other\nthan holders of the Excluded Shares) as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address any other\naspect of the merger or related transactions, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other\nalternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the price at which shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock would\ntrade at any time in the future, or the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any Xilinx officers,\ndirectors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares\nof Xilinx common stock pursuant to the merger. The opinion was addressed to, and rendered for the benefit of, the Xilinx\nboard of directors and was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of shares of\nXilinx common stock or any holder of shares of AMD common stock as to how to vote with respect to the merger. Under\nthe terms of its engagement letter, Xilinx has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of $70.0 million, which is\ncontingent upon the closing of the merger (other than $5.0 million paid upon public announcement of the merger), and\nup to an additional $40.0 million calculated based on the extent to which the value of Xilinx\u2019s shares in the merger\nimmediately prior to closing (as measured by the trading price of the AMD common stock received in the merger)\nexceeds a specified threshold. Based on the trading price of AMD common stock on March 4, 2021, the additional fee\npayable to Morgan Stanley would be approximately $19 million. $5.0 million of the transaction fee was paid upon the\npublic announcement of the merger, and the remainder is contingent upon the closing of the merger.

(or\npublicly propose to do so) any acquisition proposal.\nNotwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the approval by AMD\nstockholders of the AMD share issuance proposal or by Xilinx stockholders of the Xilinx merger proposal, as\nthe case may be, the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as applicable, may make a change of recommendation\nand/or terminate the merger agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an\nacquisition proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and\nfinancial advisor) that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and that failure to take such action\nwith respect to such acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the such\nboard of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties to such party and its stockholders under applicable legal requirements\n(and subject to compliance with certain obligations set forth in the merger agreement, including providing the\nother party with prior notice and\n24 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe opportunity to negotiate for a period to match the terms of the superior proposal and payment of the\napplicable termination fee concurrent with any such termination of the merger agreement).\nIn addition, the AMD or Xilinx board of directors, as the case may be, is permitted under certain\ncircumstances, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the AMD share issuance proposal, in the case of\nAMD, or the Xilinx merger proposal, in the case of Xilinx, and subject to compliance with certain obligations\nset forth in the merger agreement (including providing the other party with prior notice and the opportunity to\nnegotiate during such notice period to amend the terms of the merger agreement) to make a change of\nrecommendation in response to an intervening event (unrelated to an acquisition proposal) if the AMD or\nXilinx board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its\nfiduciary duties.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement (Page 176)\nThe merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned:\nby mutual written consent of AMD and Xilinx at any time prior to the effective time\u037e\nby either AMD or Xilinx, if the merger has not been consummated on or prior to the end date,\nincluding any automatic extensions thereof (however, a party may not terminate the merger agreement\nif such party\u2019s material breach of any of its obligations under the merger agreement materially\ncontributed to the failure of the closing to have occurred by the end date)\u037e\nby either AMD or Xilinx, if a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-\nappealable order or adopts or enacts a law that is final and non-appealable that permanently prevents,\nenjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the merger (however, a party may not terminate the\nmerger agreement if such party has failed in any material respect to comply with any of its obligations\nunder the merger agreement with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals)\u037e\nby either party, if the other party has made a change of recommendation, prior to the other party\nobtaining its required stockholder approval\u037e\nby either party, if either the Xilinx merger proposal or the AMD share issuance proposal is not\napproved at the Xilinx special meeting or the AMD special meeting, respectively, including any\npostponement or adjournment thereof\u037e\nby either party, if prior to obtaining such party\u2019s stockholder approval, (a) such party\u2019s board of\ndirectors shall have authorized the party to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior\nproposal, (b) concurrently with the termination of the merger agreement, such party enters into the\ndefinitive agreement relating to a superior proposal and pays the other party the applicable\ntermination fee pursuant to the merger agreement, and (c) such party has otherwise complied in all\nrespects (other than de minimis noncompliance unrelated to such superior proposal) with the\napplicable no solicitation of acquisition proposals and special meetings provisions of the merger\nagreement\u037e or\nby either party, if any representation or warranty of the other party becomes inaccurate or the other\nparty breaches any covenant in the merger agreement and such inaccuracy or breach (a) would result\nin the failure of certain conditions to closing and (b) is not curable by the end date or, if curable and\nthe other party is using reasonable best efforts to cure, is not cured by the date that is 30 days\nfollowing written notice describing such breach (however, the terminating party may not exercise this\ntermination right if it is then in breach of any representation, warranty or agreement contained in the\nmerger agreement which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to the merger agreement\nregarding accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants).\n25 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTermination Fees (Page 177)\nXilinx has agreed to pay a termination fee of $1.0 billion in cash to AMD, and AMD has agreed to pay a\ntermination fee of $1.5 billion in cash to Xilinx (together, the \u201ctermination fees\u201d), if the merger agreement is\nterminated in certain circumstances involving a change of recommendation or termination of the merger\nagreement to enter into a superior proposal, in each case by the party obligated to pay the fee. AMD and\nXilinx are also required to pay the applicable termination fee if the party obligated to pay the termination fee\nenters into or consummates a superior proposal following certain terminations of the merger agreement,\nincluding a termination due to such party\u2019s failure to obtain the required stockholder approval, after an\nalternative proposal has been made or due to a breach of such party\u2019s non-solicitation obligations under the\nmerger agreement.\nAMD must pay a regulatory termination fee of $1.0 billion in cash to Xilinx if the merger agreement is\nterminated in certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals.\nNeither AMD nor Xilinx will be required to pay a termination fee on more than one occasion. Furthermore,\nexcept in the case of fraud or intentional and material breach of the merger agreement, if a party receives a\ntermination fee, then the termination fee will be the recipient\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy against the other\nparty, its affiliates and its and their respective representatives in connection with the merger agreement.\nA termination fee will be payable by a party only once and not in duplication even though the termination fee\nmay be payable by such party pursuant to multiple circumstances.\nAccounting Treatment (Page 151)\nAMD prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the\nacquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 805,\nBusiness Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will\nrecord assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their\nrespective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described\nin Note 2 (Basis of Pro Forma Presentation) to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\nstatements) over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of AMD after completion of the merger will reflect Xilinx after\ncompletion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or\nresults of operations of Xilinx. The earnings of AMD following completion of the merger will reflect\nacquisition accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and\nliabilities on depreciation expense and amortization expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and\nintangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the\nfuture, AMD determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, AMD would\nrecord an impairment charge at that time.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (Page 151)\nAs of March 4, 2021, nine complaints have been filed by purported Xilinx stockholders and one complaint has\nbeen filed by a purported AMD stockholder, each of which seeks to enjoin the merger and other relief. The\ncomplaints assert claims against certain defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9\npromulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus\nand against certain defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability\nwith respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. Two complaints assert that the members of the\nXilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by purportedly failing to\nobtain\u200b\n26 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nadequate consideration and failing to disclose material information about the merger, and one complaint\nasserts that the members of the Xilinx board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the\nmerger by purportedly failing to obtain adequate consideration, and that AMD, Xilinx and Merger Sub aided\nand abetted the Xilinx board of directors\u2019 breach. AMD and Xilinx believe the allegations in the complaints are\nwithout merit. See \u201cThe Merger-Litigation Relating to the Merger.\u201d\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 262)\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger is intended to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming the merger so qualifies, a U.S. Holder (as defined under\n\u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) of Xilinx common stock generally will not recognize\nany gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of Xilinx common stock for AMD\ncommon stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received by Xilinx stockholders in lieu of fractional\nshares of AMD common stock.\nSee \u201cU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more complete description of certain U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the merger. Please consult your tax advisors as to the specific tax\nconsequences to you of the merger.\nComparison of Stockholders\u2019 Rights (Page 265)\nUpon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders receiving shares of AMD common stock will become AMD\nstockholders. The rights of AMD stockholders will be governed by the DGCL and the AMD charter and\nbylaws in effect at the effective time. As AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD\nand Xilinx stockholders are not materially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of\nAMD stockholders under the AMD charter and bylaws and of Xilinx stockholders under the Xilinx charter and\nbylaws. See \u201cComparison of Stockholders\u2019 Rights.\u201d\nListing of AMD Common Stock\u037e Delisting and Deregistration of Xilinx Common Stock (Page 153)\nIt is a condition to the merger that the shares of AMD common stock to be issued to Xilinx stockholders in the\nmerger be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance. If the merger is completed,\nXilinx common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which\nXilinx will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Xilinx common stock.\nXilinx has agreed to cooperate with AMD prior to the closing to cause the Xilinx common stock to be delisted\nfrom Nasdaq and be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the effective time.\nRisk Factors (Page 37)\nIn evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the share issuance, you should carefully read this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus and give special consideration to the factors discussed under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n27 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nRISK FACTORS\nIn considering how to vote on the proposals to be considered and voted on at the AMD and Xilinx special\nmeetings, you are urged to carefully consider all of the information contained or incorporated by reference\nin this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d You should also read\nand consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of AMD and Xilinx because those risks will\naffect the combined company. The risks associated with the business of AMD can be found in AMD\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and the risks associated with the business\nof Xilinx can be found in Xilinx\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2020, as\nsuch risks may be updated or supplemented in each company\u2019s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (excluding any information and exhibits furnished under Item\n2.02 or 7.01 thereof), each of which is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In\naddition, you are urged to carefully consider the following material risks relating to the merger and the\nbusinesses of AMD, Xilinx and the combined company.\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the price of either AMD or\nXilinx common stock, the value of the consideration that Xilinx stockholders will receive in the merger is uncertain.\nUpon completion of the merger, each share of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nmerger, other than shares held in treasury by Xilinx or held directly by AMD or Merger Sub, will be converted\ninto the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock (with cash, without interest and less any\napplicable withholding taxes, in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock). This exchange ratio is\nfixed in the merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either AMD or Xilinx\ncommon stock prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock have\nfluctuated prior to and after the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to\nfluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the dates of the AMD and Xilinx special\nmeetings, and through the date the merger is consummated.\nBecause the value of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of AMD common stock at the\ntime the merger is completed, Xilinx stockholders will not know or be able to determine at the time of the Xilinx\nspecial meeting the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the\nmerger. Similarly, AMD stockholders will not know or be able to determine at the time of the AMD special\nmeeting the market value of the shares of AMD common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement\ncompared to the market value of the shares of Xilinx common stock that are being exchanged in the merger.\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and\neconomic conditions, changes in AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, the\nuncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments\nof the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic\nconditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock,\nfederal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments\nin which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.\nMany of these factors are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and neither AMD nor Xilinx is permitted to\nterminate the merger agreement solely due to a decline in the market price of the common stock of the other\nparty. You are urged to obtain current market quotations for AMD and Xilinx common stock in determining\nwhether to vote in favor of the AMD share issuance proposal, in the case of AMD stockholders, or the Xilinx\nmerger proposal, in the case of Xilinx stockholders.\n37 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe market price of AMD common stock will continue to fluctuate after the merger.\nUpon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders will become holders of AMD common stock. The market\nprice of the common stock of the combined company will continue to fluctuate, potentially significantly,\nfollowing completion of the merger, including for the reasons described above. As a result, former Xilinx\nstockholders could lose some or all of the value of their investment in AMD common stock. In addition, any\nsignificant price or volume fluctuations in the stock market generally could have a material adverse effect on\nthe market for, or liquidity of, the AMD common stock received in the merger, regardless of the combined\ncompany\u2019s actual operating performance.\nThe merger may not be completed and the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied, including the approval by AMD\nstockholders of the AMD share issuance proposal and approval by Xilinx stockholders of the Xilinx merger\nproposal, or waived (to the extent permitted), in each case prior to the completion of the merger. These\nconditions are described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.\u201d These\nconditions to the completion of the merger, some of which are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, may not\nbe satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or not\ncompleted.\nAdditionally, either AMD or Xilinx may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances,\nincluding, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by the end date. In addition, if the merger\nagreement is terminated under specified circumstances, including if the Xilinx board of directors changes its\nrecommendation, Xilinx may be required to pay AMD a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement\nis terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory\napprovals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is\nterminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its\nrecommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. See \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees\u201d for a more\ncomplete discussion of the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be terminated and when a\ntermination fee may be payable by AMD or Xilinx.\nThe termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact AMD or Xilinx and the trading prices of the AMD\nor Xilinx common stock.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, including because AMD stockholders fail to approve the AMD\nshare issuance proposal or because Xilinx stockholders fail to approve the Xilinx merger proposal, the\nongoing businesses of AMD and Xilinx may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected\nbenefits of having completed the merger, AMD and Xilinx would be subject to a number of risks, including the\nfollowing:\neach company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative\nimpacts on its stock price\u037e\neach company may experience negative reactions from its customers, suppliers, distributors and\nemployees\u037e\neach company will be required to pay its respective costs relating to the merger, such as financial\nadvisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the\nmerger is completed\u037e\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of each company\u2019s business prior to\ncompletion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the\nother company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which may have prevented\nAMD and Xilinx from taking actions during the pendency of the merger that would have been\nbeneficial (see \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger\u2019s Completion\u201d for a\ndescription of the restrictive covenants applicable to AMD and Xilinx)\u037e and\n38 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmatters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of\ntime and resources by AMD and Xilinx management, which could otherwise have been devoted to\nday-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to AMD or Xilinx, as\napplicable, as an independent company.\nThe market price for shares of AMD common stock may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those\nthat historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock.\nUpon consummation of the merger, AMD stockholders and Xilinx stockholders will both hold shares of\ncommon stock in the combined company. AMD\u2019s businesses differ from those of Xilinx, and Xilinx\u2019s\nbusinesses differ from those of AMD, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company\nwill be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting the results of\noperations of AMD and Xilinx. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by\nfactors different from those that currently affect or have historically affected either AMD or Xilinx. For a\ndiscussion of the businesses of each of AMD and Xilinx and some important factors to consider in connection\nwith those businesses, see \u201cThe Parties to the Merger\u201d and the other information contained or incorporated in\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus. See \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nBased on the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding as of February 10, 2021, the latest\npracticable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, it is expected that AMD will issue\napproximately 423.6 million shares of AMD common stock in the merger. Former Xilinx stockholders may\ndecide not to hold the shares of AMD common stock that they will receive in the merger, and AMD\nstockholders may decide to reduce their investment in AMD as a result of the changes to AMD\u2019s investment\nprofile as a result of the merger. Other Xilinx stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted\nholdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of AMD common stock that they\nreceive in the merger. Such sales of AMD common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price\nfor AMD common stock.\nThe shares of common stock of the combined company to be received by Xilinx stockholders as a result of the merger\nwill have rights different from the shares of Xilinx common stock.\nUpon completion of the merger, Xilinx stockholders will no longer be stockholders of Xilinx, but will instead\nbecome stockholders of AMD. As AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD and\nXilinx stockholders are not materially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of AMD\nstockholders under AMD\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which is referred to as the\n\u201cAMD charter,\u201d and AMD\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, which are referred to as the \u201cAMD bylaws,\u201d and\nof Xilinx stockholders under Xilinx\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which is referred to as\nthe \u201cXilinx charter,\u201d and Xilinx\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, which are referred to as the \u201cXilinx bylaws.\u201d\nSee \u201cComparison of Stockholders\u2019 Rights\u201d for a discussion of these rights.\nAfter the merger, Xilinx stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in AMD than they\ncurrently have in Xilinx and will exercise less influence over management and policies of the combined company.\nBased on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding on February 10, 2021, the latest\npracticable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger,\nformer Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD\ncommon stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately\n74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. Consequently, former Xilinx stockholders will have\nless influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the\nmanagement and policies of Xilinx.\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUntil the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, AMD and\nXilinx are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be\nbeneficial to AMD, Xilinx and/or their respective stockholders.\nFrom and after the date of the merger agreement and prior to completion of the merger, the merger agreement\nrestricts AMD and Xilinx from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires\nthat the business of each company and its respective subsidiaries be conducted in the ordinary course in all\nmaterial respects. These restrictions may prevent AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, from taking actions during the\npendency of the merger that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions\nduring the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or\ntermination of the merger agreement. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the Merger\u2019s\nCompletion.\u201d\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the merger.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the merger agreement. These closing\nconditions include, among others, the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part registering the AMD common stock issuable pursuant to the\nmerger agreement and the absence of any stop order or proceedings by the SEC with respect thereto, the\nexpiration or earlier termination of any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof), and the receipt of\nrequired approvals, under U.S. and certain foreign competition laws, approval for listing on Nasdaq of the\nshares of AMD common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement, and the absence of\ngovernmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger. To the extent required,\nforeign investment filings will also be made, though these are not closing conditions. The obligation of each\nof AMD and Xilinx to consummate the merger is also conditioned on, among other things, the truth and\naccuracy of the representations and warranties made by the other party on the date of the merger agreement\nand on the closing date (subject to certain materiality and material adverse effect qualifiers), and the\nperformance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement. No\nassurance can be given that the required stockholder, governmental and regulatory consents and approvals\nwill be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and\napprovals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms,\nconditions and timing of such consents and approvals. Any delay in completing the merger could cause the\ncombined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that AMD and Xilinx\nexpect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. For a more complete\nsummary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the merger, see \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.\u201d\nAMD and Xilinx must obtain certain regulatory approvals and clearances to consummate the merger, which, if\ndelayed, not granted or granted with burdensome or unacceptable conditions, could prevent, substantially delay or\nimpair consummation of the merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the\nanticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe completion of the merger is subject to the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period (or\nextension thereof) under the HSR Act, which occurred as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 11, 2021, and\nthe receipt of the other specified regulatory clearances and approvals, including antitrust authorizations or\napprovals in the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and certain additional jurisdictions. These\njurisdictions can also impose conditions on case approval under the applicable competition laws as they deem\nnecessary or desirable, including, but not limited to, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or to not engage in certain types of conduct.\nUnited States. With respect to the United States, under the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until\nNotification and Report Forms have been filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is referred to as\n40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe \u201cFTC,\u201d and the U.S. Department of Justice, which is referred to as the \u201cDOJ,\u201d and the applicable waiting\nperiod (or any extension thereof) has expired or been terminated. A transaction requiring notification under the\nHSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of the applicable 30-day waiting period following the\nparties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR notifications or the early termination of that waiting period, at the\nearliest. Each of AMD and Xilinx filed an HSR notification with the FTC and the DOJ on November 9, 2020, and\nAMD withdrew and resubmitted its notification form on December 11, 2020. Effective as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern\nTime, on January 11, 2021, the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the\napplicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the DOJ or the FTC, or any state, could take such action under\ncompetition laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to\nlicense, or hold separate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Under certain\ncircumstances, private parties may also seek to take legal action against the merger under competition laws.\nEuropean Union. Both AMD and Xilinx conduct business across the European Union in multiple Member\nStates. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and\nregulations promulgated thereunder, which is referred to as the \u201cEU Merger Regulation,\u201d mergers and\nacquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European Union sales exceeding specified\nthresholds must be notified to, and approved by, the European Commission before they are implemented.\nAMD and Xilinx meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore obliged to (i)\nnotify the European Commission of AMD\u2019s proposed acquisition of Xilinx and (ii) wait to implement the\nmerger until after the European Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the\ncommon market (and/or if the European Commission has referred any aspect of the merger to one or more\ncompetent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU Merger Regulation or an\nEFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each competent authority has issued a\nclearance or a confirmation that the merger may proceed). As is customary, AMD and Xilinx have begun pre-\nnotification consultations with the European Commission and intend to file a formal notification as soon as is\nreasonably possible.\nUnited Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, the parties intend to notify the merger to the\nCompetition and Markets Authority, which is referred to as the \u201cCMA,\u201d under the Enterprise Act 2002. The\nCMA may issue an order that, among other things, prevents the completion of the merger or prevents the\nintegration of the parties\u2019 businesses. The practical effect of this is typically that the merger may not be\ncompleted until the merger has been notified to the CMA and the merging parties have obtained clearance.\nAMD and Xilinx have begun pre-notification discussions with the CMA and will file a formal notification as\nsoon as is reasonably practicable.\nChina. Under the Antimonopoly Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which is referred to as the \u201cAML,\u201d\ntransactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until they are\nreviewed and approved by the State Administration of Market Regulation, which is referred to as \u201cSAMR.\u201d\nAMD and Xilinx have sufficient revenues to exceed SAMR\u2019s statutory thresholds for review, and completion\nof the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. AMD and Xilinx expect to submit a draft\nnotification to SAMR.\nThe merger is also subject to clearance or approval by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions.\nThe merger cannot be completed until AMD and Xilinx obtain clearance to consummate the merger or\napplicable waiting periods (or any extension thereof) have expired or been terminated in each applicable\njurisdiction. AMD and Xilinx, in consultation and cooperation with each other, will file notifications, as\nrequired by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions, as promptly as practicable after the date of\nthe merger agreement. The relevant competition authorities could take such actions under applicable\ncompetition laws as they deem\n41 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnecessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the\nparties to license, or hold separate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Any\none of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the\ncompletion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger. There is no assurance that AMD and Xilinx will\nobtain all required regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to obtain the\nnecessary clearances in any of these jurisdictions could substantially delay or prevent the consummation of\nthe merger, which could negatively impact both AMD and Xilinx.\nFailure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of\nthe merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company\u2019s ability to retain the talents and\ndedication of the professionals currently employed by AMD and Xilinx. It is possible that these employees\nmay decide not to remain with AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, while the merger is pending, or with the combined\ncompany. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained\nto maintain effective operations, the combined company\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected and\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating AMD and Xilinx to hiring suitable\nreplacements, all of which may cause the combined company\u2019s business to suffer. In addition, AMD and Xilinx\nmay not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees that leave either company or offer\nemployment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, there could be disruptions to or\ndistractions for the workforce and management, including disruptions associated with integrating employees\ninto the combined company. No assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or\nretain key employees of AMD and Xilinx to the same extent that those companies have been able to attract or\nretain their own employees in the past.\nThe merger, and uncertainty regarding the merger, may cause customers, suppliers, distributors or strategic partners\nto delay or defer decisions concerning AMD or Xilinx and adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to effectively\nmanage its respective business.\nThe merger will happen only if the stated conditions are met, including the approval of the AMD share\nissuance proposal, the approval of the Xilinx merger proposal and the receipt of required regulatory approvals,\namong other conditions. Many of the conditions are beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and both parties\nalso have certain rights to terminate the merger agreement. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding\nthe completion of the merger. This uncertainty may cause customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors,\nstrategic partners or others that deal with AMD or Xilinx to delay or defer entering into contracts with AMD\nor Xilinx or making other decisions concerning AMD or Xilinx or seek to change or cancel existing business\nrelationships with AMD or Xilinx, which could negatively affect their respective businesses. Any delay or\ndeferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have an adverse impact on the respective\nbusinesses of AMD and Xilinx, regardless of whether the merger is ultimately completed.\nIn addition, the merger agreement restricts AMD, Xilinx and their respective subsidiaries from taking certain\nactions during the pendency of the merger without the consent of the other parties. These restrictions may\nprevent AMD and Xilinx from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may\narise prior to the completion of the merger. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business Prior to the\nMerger\u2019s Completion\u201d for a description of the restrictive covenants to which each of AMD and Xilinx is\nsubject.\nThe opinions rendered to AMD and Xilinx from their respective financial advisors will not reflect changes in\ncircumstances between the dates of such opinions and the completion of the merger.\nDBO and Credit Suisse delivered their oral opinions to the AMD board of directors on October 26, 2020, which\nopinions were subsequently confirmed in a written opinion from each of DBO and Credit Suisse dated as of\nOctober 26, 2020, to the effect that as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered in connection with the\npreparation of each opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to AMD.\nMorgan Stanley delivered its oral opinion to the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020, which opinion\nwas subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of October 26, 2020, that as of such date and based\nupon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the written opinion, the\nexchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of\nXilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares).\nBofA Securities delivered its oral opinion to the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020, which opinion\nwas subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of October 26, 2020, that as of such date and based\nupon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken as set forth in the written opinion, the\nexchange ratio provided for in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Xilinx\ncommon stock.\nNeither AMD nor Xilinx has obtained, nor will either of them obtain, an updated opinion from DBO, Credit\nSuisse, Morgan Stanley or BofA Securities, as applicable, regarding the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the exchange ratio, including as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or of the special\nmeetings, or prior to the completion of the merger. Each of the respective opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse,\nMorgan Stanley and BofA Securities was necessarily based on general financial, economic, monetary, market\nand other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to DBO, Credit\nSuisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, as applicable, only as of the dates of the respective opinions of\nDBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities, and such opinions do not address the fairness of\nthe exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, at the time the merger is completed. Changes in the\noperations and prospects of AMD or Xilinx, general financial, economic, monetary, market and other\nconditions, circumstances and factors that may be beyond the control of AMD and Xilinx, and on which each\nof the respective opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities was based, may alter\nthe value of AMD or Xilinx or the prices of shares of AMD or Xilinx common stock by the time the merger is\ncompleted. The opinions of DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities do not speak as of any\ndate other than the respective dates of such opinions. The recommendation of the AMD board of directors\nthat AMD stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD adjournment\nproposal and the recommendation of the Xilinx board of directors that Xilinx stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nXilinx merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal\nare each made as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinions that\nAMD and Xilinx received from their respective financial advisors, see \u201cThe Merger-Opinions of AMD\u2019s\nFinancial Advisors\u201d and \u201cThe Merger-\u200bOpinion of Xilinx\u2019s Financial Advisors.\u201d\nWhether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in the\nbusinesses of AMD and Xilinx, which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses and financial results.\nWhether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause\ndisruptions in the businesses of AMD and Xilinx, including by diverting the attention of AMD and Xilinx\nmanagement toward the completion of the merger. In addition, AMD and Xilinx have each diverted significant\nmanagement resources in an effort to complete the merger and are each subject to restrictions contained in the\nmerger agreement on the conduct of their respective businesses. If the merger is not completed, AMD and\nXilinx will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which they\nwill have received little or no benefit.\n43 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nXilinx directors and executive officers have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to,\nthose of Xilinx stockholders generally.\nWhen considering the recommendations of the Xilinx board of directors on how to vote on the proposals\ndescribed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Xilinx stockholders should be aware that Xilinx directors\nand executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Xilinx\nstockholders generally. These interests include the continued service of certain Xilinx directors as directors of\nthe combined company, the treatment in the merger of outstanding equity, equity-based and incentive awards,\nseverance arrangements, other compensation and benefit arrangements, and the right to continued\nindemnification of former Xilinx directors and officers by the combined company.\nXilinx stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider the recommendations of the Xilinx\nboard of directors that they vote to approve the Xilinx merger proposal. The Xilinx board of directors was\naware of and considered these interests when it determined that the merger was fair to and in the best\ninterests of Xilinx and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, and\nrecommended that Xilinx stockholders adopt the merger agreement. The interests of Xilinx directors and\nexecutive officers are described in more detail under \u201cInterests of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger.\u201d\nAMD or Xilinx may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.\nTo the extent permitted by law, AMD or Xilinx may determine to waive, in whole or part, one or more of the\nconditions to their respective obligations to consummate the merger. AMD and Xilinx currently expect to\nevaluate the materiality of any waiver and its effect on AMD or Xilinx stockholders, as applicable, in light of\nthe facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any amendment of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies is required in light of such waiver. Any determination as\nto whether to waive any condition to the merger, and as to whether to re-solicit stockholder approval and/or\namend this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a result of such waiver, will be made by AMD or Xilinx, as\napplicable, at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be\nwilling to pay more to acquire or merge with either AMD or Xilinx.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d provisions that restrict the ability of AMD and Xilinx to, among\nother things (each as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals\u201d):\nsolicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the\nsubmission or announcement by any person of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would\nreasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal\u037e\nfurnish any information regarding AMD, Xilinx or their respective subsidiaries in connection with, for\nthe purpose of soliciting, initiating, encouraging or facilitating, or in response to, an acquisition\nproposal\u037e\nengage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to\nany acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead\nto an acquisition proposal\u037e or\napprove, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any\nletter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with respect to\nany acquisition proposal.\nFurthermore, there are only limited exceptions to the requirement under the merger agreement that neither the\nAMD nor Xilinx boards of directors withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the AMD recommendation or the\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nXilinx recommendation, as applicable (each as defined under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Representations and\nWarranties\u201d). Although the AMD or Xilinx board of directors is permitted to effect a change of\nrecommendation, after complying with certain procedures set forth in the merger agreement, in response to a\nsuperior proposal or to an intervening event (if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith that\na failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law),\nsuch change of recommendation would entitle the other party to terminate the merger agreement and collect a\ntermination fee from the party making a change of recommendation. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination\nof the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees.\u201d\nThese provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer from considering or proposing an\nacquisition or merger, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than that implied by\nthe exchange ratio in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per\nshare price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.\nThe merger will involve substantial costs.\nAMD and Xilinx have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with combining the\noperations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. As of the\ndate of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AMD and Xilinx estimate that their aggregate costs associated\nwith the merger and related transactions will be approximately $80 million and $138 million, respectively. These\ncosts include filing and registration fees with the SEC, printing and mailing costs associated with this joint\nproxy/registration statement, and legal, accounting, investment banking, consulting, public relations and\nproxy solicitation fees. These costs do not include severance and retention payments that may be made to\ncertain Xilinx employees and costs that will be incurred in connection with the integration of AMD\u2019s and\nXilinx\u2019s businesses. Some of these costs are payable by AMD or Xilinx regardless of whether the merger is\ncompleted.\nThe combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger. The\ncosts related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either AMD or\nthe combined company. There are processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that\nmust be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of Xilinx\u2019s business. Although AMD\nexpects that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the\nrealization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction,\nmerger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nMany of these costs will be borne by AMD even if the merger is not completed. While AMD has assumed that\ncertain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement, there are many factors beyond AMD\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the\ntiming of the integration and implementation expenses.\nAMD and Xilinx stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.\nAppraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to\ndissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that such corporation pay the fair\nvalue for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration\noffered to such stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL, stockholders\ngenerally do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold are either listed on a national securities\nexchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are\navailable if stockholders are required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares anything\nother than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that will\neither be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash in lieu\nof fractional shares or (d) any combination of the foregoing.\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBecause the merger is of Merger Sub with and into Xilinx and holders of AMD common stock will continue to\nhold their shares following completion of the merger, holders of AMD common stock are not entitled to\nappraisal rights in connection with the merger.\nBecause AMD common stock is listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange, and because Xilinx\nstockholders are not required by the terms of the merger agreement to accept for their shares of Xilinx common\nstock anything other than shares of AMD common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, holders of\nXilinx common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. See \u201cNo Appraisal\nRights.\u201d\nLawsuits filed against AMD and/or Xilinx may delay or prevent the merger from being completed.\nAMD, Xilinx and members of the AMD and Xilinx boards of directors currently are and may in the future be\nparties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the merger agreement and the merger,\nincluding putative shareholder class actions. See \u201cThe Merger-Litigation Relating to the Merger.\u201d Among\nother remedies, the plaintiffs in such matters are seeking to enjoin the merger. The results of complex legal\nproceedings are difficult to predict, and could prevent or delay the merger from being completed in a timely\nmanner, and could result in substantial costs to AMD and Xilinx, including, but not limited to, costs\nassociated with the indemnification of their respective directors and officers. The existence of litigation\nrelating to the merger could also impact the likelihood of obtaining the required approvals from either AMD or\nXilinx stockholders. Moreover, the pending litigation and any future additional litigation could be time\nconsuming and expensive, could divert the attention of AMD and Xilinx management away from their regular\nbusinesses and, if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either AMD or Xilinx, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s respective financial condition.\nOne of the conditions to the completion of the merger is that no injunction by any court or other governmental\nentity of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that prevents, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of\nthe merger. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the\nconsummation of the merger, that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective or from\nbecoming effective.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company\nCombining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the\ncombined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the\ncombined company\u2019s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nThe success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of AMD and Xilinx to combine their\nbusinesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. AMD and\nXilinx have entered into the merger agreement because each believes that the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of their respective\nstockholders and that combining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx will produce benefits and cost savings.\nSee \u201cThe Merger-\u200bRecommendation of the AMD Board of Directors\u037e AMD\u2019s Reasons for the Merger\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger-\u200bRecommendation of the Xilinx Board of Directors\u037e Xilinx\u2019s Reasons for the Merger.\u201d\nHowever, AMD and Xilinx must successfully combine their respective businesses in a manner that permits\nthese benefits to be realized. In addition, the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost\nsavings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If the combined\ncompany is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not\nbe realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could\nhave\n46 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nan adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company.\nIn addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated\nbenefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower\nthan what AMD and Xilinx expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If AMD and Xilinx are not\nable to adequately address integration challenges, they may be unable to successfully integrate their\noperations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.\u200b\nThe failure to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of AMD and Xilinx in the expected time frame may\nadversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results.\nAMD and Xilinx have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate independently.\nThere can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the\nintegration process could result in the loss of key AMD or Xilinx employees, the loss of customers, the\ndisruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards,\ncontrols, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and\nan overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the\nfollowing issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of AMD and Xilinx in order\nto realize the anticipated benefits of the merger so the combined company performs as expected:\ncombining the companies\u2019 operations and corporate functions\u037e\ncombining the businesses of AMD and Xilinx and meeting the capital requirements of the combined\ncompany, in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve any cost savings or other\nsynergies anticipated to result from the merger, the failure of which would result in the anticipated\nbenefits of the merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all\u037e\nintegrating personnel from the two companies, especially in the COVID-19 environment which has\nrequired employees to work remotely in most locations\u037e\nintegrating the companies\u2019 technologies and technologies licensed from third parties\u037e\nintegrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers\u037e\nidentifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets\u037e\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs,\ninternal controls and other policies, procedures and processes\u037e\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, avoiding delays\nin entering into new agreements with prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, and\nleveraging relationships with such third parties for the benefit of the combined company\u037e\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management\nphilosophies\u037e\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure\u037e\ncoordinating distribution and marketing efforts\u037e\nmanaging the movement of certain positions to different locations\u037e\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations\u037e and\neffecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental\napprovals.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 management and\nresources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompanies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been\nbeneficial to such company, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the\ncombined company.\nThe combined company may not be able to retain customers, suppliers or distributors, or customers, suppliers or\ndistributors may seek to modify contractual relationships with the combined company, which could have an adverse\neffect on the combined company\u2019s business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or\nrelationships with AMD or Xilinx.\nAs a result of the merger, the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers,\nsuppliers and distributors that may harm the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations. Certain\ncustomers, suppliers or distributors may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the\nmerger whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of the merger. There can be no guarantee that\ncustomers, suppliers and distributors will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined\ncompany or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the merger. If any customers, suppliers or\ndistributors seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the\ncombined company, then the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations may be harmed.\nFurthermore, the combined company will not have long-term arrangements with many of its significant\nsuppliers. If the combined company\u2019s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the\ncombined company, then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies from other\nsuppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAMD and Xilinx also have contracts with vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners which\nmay require AMD or Xilinx, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the\nmerger, or which may otherwise contain limitations applicable to such contracts following the merger. If these\nconsents cannot be obtained, the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur\ncosts and lose rights that may be material to the combined company\u2019s business. In addition, third parties with\nwhom AMD or Xilinx currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their\nrelationship with either party in anticipation of the merger. Any such disruptions could limit the combined\ncompany\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The adverse effect of any such\ndisruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or by a termination of the\nmerger agreement.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined\ncompany\u2019s business and operations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers,\ndistributors, consumers and other third parties due to the combination of AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s businesses\nfollowing the merger. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and\nresults of operations or may cause disruptions to the combined company\u2019s operations.\nThe AMD and Xilinx unaudited prospective financial information is inherently subject to uncertainties, the unaudited\npro forma condensed combined financial information included in this document is preliminary and the combined\ncompany\u2019s actual financial position and results of operations after the merger may differ materially from these\nestimates and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the effect\nof any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and unaudited pro forma per share data\nincluded in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only, contain a\nvariety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and are not necessarily indicative of what the\ncombined company\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the merger been\ncompleted on the dates indicated. The combined company\u2019s actual results and financial position after the\nmerger may differ\n48 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmaterially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\ndoes not reflect the effect of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger. See\n\u201cComparative Historical Unaudited Pro Forma Per Share Data\u201d and \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed\nCombined Financial Statements.\u201d\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the AMD and Xilinx unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information provided in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is based on numerous variables and\nassumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition, general\nbusiness, the semiconductor and related industries, and economic, market and financial conditions and\nadditional matters specific to AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and\nuncertain and are beyond the control of the respective management teams of AMD and Xilinx. As a result,\nactual results may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nImportant factors that may affect actual results and cause these unaudited projected financial forecasts to not\nbe achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s business, as\napplicable (including each company\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable\nperiods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions. See \u201cThe Merger-AMD Unaudited\nFinancial Projections,\u201d \u201cThe Merger-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d and \u201cThe Merger-Certain\nEstimated Synergies.\u201d\nThe combined company\u2019s debt may limit its financial flexibility.\nAMD and Xilinx continue to review the treatment of their existing indebtedness. AMD and Xilinx may seek to\nrepay, refinance, repurchase, redeem, exchange or otherwise terminate their existing indebtedness prior to, in\nconnection with or following the completion of the merger. If either AMD or Xilinx seeks to refinance its\nexisting indebtedness, there can be no guarantee that it will be able to execute the refinancing on favorable\nterms or at all. Alternatively, AMD and Xilinx may seek to leave all or a portion of their existing indebtedness\noutstanding as the primary obligation of the combined company or to incur additional indebtedness or\nrefinancing indebtedness prior to, in connection with or following the completion of the merger.\nAMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have adverse effects on such company\u2019s and/or the\ncombined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including:\nincreasing its vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions\u037e\nlimiting its ability to compete and its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business\nand the industry\u037e\nlimiting its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders\u037e\nlimiting its ability to borrow additional funds\u037e and\nincreasing its interest expense and requiring it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from\noperations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\nThe companies\u2019 ability to arrange any additional financing for the purposes described above or otherwise will\ndepend on, among other factors, the companies\u2019 respective financial positions and performance, as well as\nprevailing market conditions and other factors beyond their control. The level and quality of the combined\ncompany\u2019s earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact the determination\nof the combined company\u2019s credit ratings. A decrease in the ratings assigned to the combined company by the\nratings agencies may negatively impact the combined company\u2019s access to the debt capital markets and\nincrease the combined company\u2019s cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the combined company\nwill be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the\ncombined\n49 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompany will be able to maintain the current creditworthiness or prospective credit ratings of AMD or Xilinx,\nand any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on the\nliquidity, capital position or access to capital markets of the combined company.\nIf the existing indebtedness of AMD and/or Xilinx remains outstanding, or if either company refinances its existing\nindebtedness, covenants contained in the agreements governing such indebtedness will impose restrictions on the\ncombined company and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.\nThe agreements that govern the indebtedness of AMD and Xilinx, in addition to any refinanced indebtedness,\nmay contain various affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants may, subject to certain significant\nexceptions, restrict the ability of the combined company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things,\nincur liens, incur debt, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, transfer assets outside the\nordinary course of business, make loans or other investments, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests,\nmake other payments with respect to equity interests, repay or repurchase subordinated debt and engage in\naffiliate transactions. In addition, the agreements governing the existing indebtedness of AMD and Xilinx\ncontain financial covenants that would require the combined company to maintain certain financial ratios\nunder certain circumstances. The ability of the combined company and its subsidiaries to comply with these\nprovisions may be affected by events beyond their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could\nresult in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the combined company\u2019s\nrepayment obligations.\nDeclaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, distributed to stockholders of the combined company will be\nuncertain.\nAMD has not historically paid cash dividends on its capital stock. Whether any dividends are declared or\npaid to stockholders of the combined company, and the amounts of any such dividends that are declared or\npaid, are uncertain and depend on a number of factors. If dividends are paid to stockholders of the combined\ncompany, they may not be of the same amount as paid by Xilinx to its stockholders prior to the merger. The\nAMD board of directors will have the discretion to determine the dividend policy of the combined company,\nincluding the amount and timing of dividends, if any, that the combined company may declare from time to\ntime, which may be impacted by any of the following factors:\nthe combined company may not have enough cash to pay such dividends or to repurchase shares\ndue to its cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position\u037e\ndecisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all\ntimes entirely at the discretion of the AMD board of directors, which could change its dividend\npractices at any time and for any reason\u037e\nthe combined company\u2019s desire to maintain or improve the credit ratings on its debt\u037e\nthe amount of dividends that the combined company may distribute to its stockholders is subject to\nrestrictions under Delaware law and is limited by restricted payment and leverage covenants in the\ncombined company\u2019s credit facilities and indentures and, potentially, the terms of any future\nindebtedness that the combined company may incur\u037e and\ncertain limitations on the amount of dividends subsidiaries of the combined company can distribute\nto the combined company, as imposed by state law, regulators or agreements.\nStockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not\nbeen declared.\nThe combined company is subject to risks arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, has\nspread across the globe and disrupted the global economy. Governmental actions to reduce the spread of\n50 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCOVID-19 have negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment in many ways, while the pandemic itself\nhas significantly increased economic uncertainty and abruptly reduced economic activity.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the combined company is highly uncertain and is\ndifficult to predict. The pandemic\u2019s effects and their extent will depend on various factors, including, but not\nlimited to, the duration, scope and impact of the pandemic, restrictions on business and social distancing\nguidelines that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities and how quickly and to what\nextent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Relevant adverse consequences of the\npandemic could include reduced liquidity, increased volatility of the combined company\u2019s stock price,\noperational disruption or failure due to spread of disease within the combined company or due to restrictions\non business and social distancing guidelines imposed or requested by governmental authorities,\nunavailability of raw materials, disruption in the supply chain and increased cybersecurity and fraud risks due\nto increased online and remote activity, as well as the adverse consequences of a macroeconomic slowdown,\nrecession or depression.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the combined company may continue to experience adverse\nimpacts to its business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nreduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any\nrecession or depression that may occur.\nAny impairment of the combined company\u2019s tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets,\nincluding goodwill, may adversely impact the combined company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC\n805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will\nrecord assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their\nrespective fair values at the date of completion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price over the net\nfair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the merger, the\ncombined company is expected to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated\nbalance sheet. See \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.\u201d\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all\ntangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are\npresent. If, in the future, the combined company determines that tangible or intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, are impaired, the combined company would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment\ntesting of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as\nit relates to the determination of fair value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash\nflows of the combined company\u2019s business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in\nthe impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, which may have a material adverse impact on the\ncombined company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe AMD bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the U.S.\nfederal district courts as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between AMD and its stockholders, which\nwill restrict the ability of stockholders of the combined company to choose the judicial forum for disputes with the\ncombined company or its directors, officers or employees.\nThe AMD bylaws provide that, unless AMD consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive\nforum for the following types of actions or proceedings: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on\nbehalf of AMD\u037e (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former\nAMD director, officer, employee or stockholder to AMD or its stockholders\u037e (iii) any action asserting a claim\narising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the AMD charter or the AMD bylaws or as to which the DGCL\nconfers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware\u037e or (iv) any action asserting a claim\ngoverned by\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe internal affairs doctrine. Nothing in the AMD charter or the AMD bylaws would preclude stockholders\nthat assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent the\nExchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities\nAct actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. The AMD\nbylaws provide that the U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. However, there is uncertainty as to whether a\ncourt would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the\nSecurities Act.\nThese forum selection provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it\nfinds favorable for disputes with the combined company or its directors, officers or other employees, which\nmay discourage such lawsuits. While Delaware courts have determined that such forum selection provisions\nare facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act\nagainst the combined company and its directors, officers or other employees in a venue other than in the U.S.\nfederal district courts. In such instance, the combined company would expect to vigorously assert the validity\nand enforceability of these forum selection provisions. This may require further significant additional costs\nassociated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the forum\nselection provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions, any of which could seriously\nharm the combined company\u2019s business.\nOther Risk Factors of AMD and Xilinx\nAMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, AMD and\nXilinx are, and will continue to be, subject to the risks described in, as applicable, AMD\u2019s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and Xilinx\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended March 28, 2020, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company\u2019s subsequently\nfiled Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, each of which are filed with the SEC\nand incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

AMD stockholders are encouraged to read this entire document\ncarefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference herein, for more detailed\ninformation regarding the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nDate, Time and Place of the AMD Special Meeting\nThe AMD special meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on April 7, 2021, beginning at 9:30\na.m., Pacific Time, unless postponed to a later date.\nIn light of ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD has elected to hold the AMD\nspecial meeting solely by means of remote communication via live webcast. AMD stockholders will be able to\nvirtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AMD2021SM, which is referred to as the \u201cAMD special meeting\nwebsite.\u201d AMD stockholders will need the 16-digit control number found on their proxy card in order to\naccess the AMD special meeting website and to access the list of AMD stockholders entitled to vote at the\nAMD special meeting during the time of the meeting.\nAMD has retained Broadridge to host the live webcast of the AMD special meeting. On the day of the AMD\nspecial meeting, Broadridge may be contacted at (844) 976-0738 (U.S.) or (303) 562-9301 (international), and will\nbe available to answer any questions regarding how to virtually attend the AMD special meeting or if you\nencounter any technical difficulty accessing or during the AMD special meeting.\nMatters to Be Considered at the AMD Special Meeting\nThe purpose of the AMD special meeting is to consider and vote on each of the following proposals, each of\nwhich is further described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus:\nAMD Proposal 1: Approval of the Share Issuance. To consider and vote on the AMD share issuance\nproposal\u037e and\nAMD Proposal 2: Adjournment of the AMD Special Meeting. To consider and vote on the AMD\nadjournment proposal.\nRecommendation of the AMD Board of Directors\nThe AMD board of directors unanimously recommends that AMD stockholders vote:\nAMD Proposal 1: \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD share issuance proposal\u037e and\nAMD Proposal 2: \u201cFOR\u201d the AMD adjournment proposal.\nAfter careful consideration, the AMD board of directors unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the\nmerger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of AMD and its stockholders\u037e (ii)\napproved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including\nthe merger and the share issuance, each on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger\nagreement\u037e and (iii) recommended that AMD stockholders approve of the AMD share issuance proposal. See\n\u201cThe Merger-\u200bRecommendation of the AMD Board of Directors\u037e AMD\u2019s Reasons for the Merger.\u201d\nRecord Date for the AMD Special Meeting and Voting Rights\nThe record date to determine AMD stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD\nspecial meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof is February 10, 2021. As of the close of\nbusiness on the AMD record date, there were 1,211,803,421 shares of AMD common stock issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting.\n55 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach AMD stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of AMD common stock such holder owned of\nrecord at the close of business on the AMD record date with respect to each matter properly brought before\nthe AMD special meeting. Only AMD stockholders of record at the close of business on the AMD record date\nare entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the AMD special meeting and any and all adjournments or\npostponements thereof.\nQuorum\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nA quorum of AMD stockholders is necessary to conduct the AMD special meeting. The presence, virtually via\nthe AMD special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding\nshares of AMD common stock entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of\nAMD common stock represented at the AMD special meeting by virtual attendance via the AMD special\nmeeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which an AMD\nstockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.\nHowever, because all of the proposals for consideration at the AMD special meeting are considered \u201cnon-\nroutine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be counted as\npresent for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the AMD stockholder provides their\nbank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the AMD special\nmeeting. If a quorum is not present, the AMD special meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders\nof the number of shares of AMD common stock required to constitute a quorum attend.\nUnder Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain \u201croutine\u201d\nproposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However, banks,\nbrokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under\nNasdaq rules are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which occurs on an item when (i) a\nbank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be\nvoted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other \u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,\nbroker or other nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter. All of the proposals before the\nAMD special meeting are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules, and banks, brokers or other\nnominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the AMD special meeting. As a\nresult, AMD does not expect any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting and if you hold your shares of\nAMD common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter\nunless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance\nwith the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you\ncast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote\non any of the proposals before the AMD special meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owners.\nRequired Votes\nExcept for the AMD adjournment proposal, the vote required to approve each of the proposals listed below\nassumes the presence of a quorum at the AMD special meeting. As described above, AMD does not expect\nthere to be any broker non-votes at the AMD special meeting.\nProposal\nRequired Vote\nEffects of Certain Actions\nAMD\nProposal 1:\nAMD share\nissuance\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of AMD common stock\nthat are virtually present via the AMD special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal.\nAny shares not virtually present or\nrepresented by proxy (including due to the\nfailure of an AMD stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker\nor other nominee to provide voting\ninstructions to such bank, broker or other\nnominee) will have no effect on the outcome of\nthe AMD share issuance proposal.\n56 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProposal\nRequired Vote\nEffects of Certain Actions\nAn abstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the AMD special meeting on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal to vote on\nthe AMD share issuance proposal will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the AMD\nshare issuance proposal.

You may also change your vote\nby obtaining your specific control number and instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee and\nvoting your shares at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nAMD is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all AMD stockholders to vote on agenda items,\nwhether or not such AMD stockholders are able to virtually attend the AMD special meeting or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof. AMD will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from AMD\nstockholders. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, AMD will request that banks, brokers and other\nnominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of AMD common stock and\nsecure their voting instructions, if necessary. AMD may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and\nother nominees on request for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.\nAMD has also retained Mackenzie Partners to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with AMD\nstockholders and estimates that it will pay them a fee of approximately $60,000, plus reimbursement for certain\nout-of-pocket fees and expenses. AMD also has agreed to indemnify Mackenzie Partners against various\nliabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nProxies may be solicited on behalf of AMD or by AMD directors, officers and other employees in person or by\nmail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic\ncommunication. AMD directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their\nservices or solicitation in this regard.\n59 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVirtually Attending the AMD Special Meeting\nIf you wish to virtually attend the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website, you must (i) be\na AMD stockholder of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021 (the AMD record date), (ii) hold\nyour shares of AMD common stock beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee as of the AMD\nrecord date or (iii) hold a valid proxy for the AMD special meeting.\nTo enter the AMD special meeting website and virtually attend the AMD special meeting, you will need the\n16-digit control number located on your proxy card. If you hold your shares of AMD common stock in street\nname beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to virtually attend the AMD special\nmeeting via the AMD special meeting website, you will need to obtain your specific control number and\nfurther instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee. The 16-digit control number is also needed to\naccess the list of AMD stockholders entitled to vote at the AMD special meeting during the time of the\nmeeting.\nIf you plan to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website,\nAMD still encourages you to vote in advance by the internet, telephone or (if you received a paper copy of\nthe proxy materials) by mail so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to virtually attend\nthe AMD special meeting via the AMD special meeting website. Voting your proxy by the internet, telephone\nor mail will not limit your right to virtually attend and vote at the AMD special meeting via the AMD special\nmeeting website if you later decide to do so.\nHouseholding\nSEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy\nstatements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a\nsingle proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d provides cost savings for companies. AMD has previously adopted\nhouseholding for AMD stockholders of record. As a result, AMD stockholders with the same address and last\nname may receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Registered AMD stockholders\n(those who hold shares of AMD common stock directly in their name with AMD\u2019s transfer agent) may opt out\nof householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending\na written request to AMD at the address below.\nSome brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple AMD\nstockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected\nstockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to\nyour address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If,\nat any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy\nstatement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to\nrequest that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.\nAMD will promptly deliver a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any AMD stockholder who only\nreceived one copy of these materials due to householding upon request in writing to: Advanced Micro\nDevices, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, corporate.secretary@amd.com, 2485 Augustine Drive, Santa Clara,\nCalifornia 95054 or by calling (408) 749-4000.\nTabulation of Votes\nThe AMD board of directors will appoint an independent inspector of election for the AMD special meeting.\nThe inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of AMD common stock\nvirtually present or represented by proxy at the AMD special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum,\ndetermine the validity of all proxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to\nAMD stockholders at the AMD special meeting.\n60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdjournments\nIf a quorum is present at the AMD special meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the AMD\nspecial meeting to approve the AMD share issuance proposal, then AMD stockholders may be asked to vote\non the AMD adjournment proposal.\nAt any subsequent reconvening of the AMD special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may\nbe transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting, and all proxies will be voted in the same\nmanner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the AMD special meeting, except for any\nproxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened\nmeeting.\nAssistance\nIf you need assistance voting or completing your proxy card, or if you have questions regarding the AMD\nspecial meeting, please contact Mackenzie Partners, AMD\u2019s proxy solicitor for the AMD special meeting, at:\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor \nNew York, New York 10018 \n(800) 322-2885 \nBanks and Brokers: (212) 929-5500 \nproxy@mackenziepartners.com\nAMD STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/\u200bPROSPECTUS IN ITS\nENTIRETY FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE\nMERGER.

Xilinx stockholders are encouraged to read this entire document\ncarefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference herein, for more detailed\ninformation regarding the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nDate, Time and Place of the Xilinx Special Meeting\nThe Xilinx special meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on April 7, 2021, beginning at 9:30\na.m., Pacific Time, unless postponed to a later date.\nIn light of ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Xilinx has elected to hold the Xilinx\nspecial meeting solely by means of remote communication via live webcast. Xilinx stockholders will be able to\nvirtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting by visiting https://viewproxy.com/Xilinx/2021, which is\nreferred to as the \u201cXilinx special meeting website.\u201d Xilinx stockholders must first register at the Xilinx special\nmeeting website in order to obtain a unique meeting invitation by electronic mail.

To consider and vote on the Xilinx merger\nproposal\u037e\nXilinx Proposal 2: Approval, on an Advisory Non-Binding Basis, of Certain Merger-Related\nCompensatory Arrangements with Xilinx\u2019s Named Executive Officers.

To consider and vote on the Xilinx\nadjournment proposal.\nRecommendation of the Xilinx Board of Directors\nThe Xilinx board of directors unanimously recommends that Xilinx stockholders vote:\nXilinx Proposal 1: \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx merger proposal\u037e\nXilinx Proposal 2: \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx compensation proposal\u037e and\nXilinx Proposal 3: \u201cFOR\u201d the Xilinx adjournment proposal.\nAfter careful consideration, the Xilinx board of directors unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Xilinx and\nits stockholders\u037e (ii) declared advisable, approved and authorized in all respects the merger agreement, the\nperformance of Xilinx of its obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nthereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement\u037e and (iii) recommended\nthat Xilinx stockholders adopt the merger agreement. See \u201cThe Merger-Recommendation of the Xilinx Board of\nDirectors\u037e Xilinx\u2019s Reasons for the Merger.\u201d\n64 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecord Date for the Xilinx Special Meeting and Voting Rights\nThe record date to determine Xilinx stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Xilinx\nspecial meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof is February 10, 2021. As of the close of\nbusiness on the Xilinx record date, there were 245,766,700 shares of Xilinx common stock issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting (which includes 7,587 Xilinx RSUs which had\nvested but were yet to be settled).\nEach Xilinx stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Xilinx common stock such holder owned of\nrecord at the close of business on the Xilinx record date with respect to each matter properly brought before\nthe Xilinx special meeting. Only Xilinx stockholders of record at the close of business on the Xilinx record date\nare entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Xilinx special meeting and any and all adjournments or\npostponements thereof.\nQuorum\u037e Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nA quorum of Xilinx stockholders is necessary to conduct the Xilinx special meeting. The presence, virtually\nvia the Xilinx special meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding\nshares of Xilinx common stock entitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting will constitute a quorum. Shares of\nXilinx common stock represented at the Xilinx special meeting by virtual attendance via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website or by proxy and entitled to vote, but not voted, including shares for which a Xilinx\nstockholder directs an \u201cabstention\u201d from voting, will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.\nHowever, because all of the proposals for consideration at the Xilinx special meeting are considered \u201cnon-\nroutine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules (as described below), shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be counted as\npresent for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum unless the Xilinx stockholder provides their\nbank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions for at least one of the proposals at the Xilinx special\nmeeting. If a quorum is not present, the Xilinx special meeting will be adjourned or postponed until the holders\nof the number of shares of Xilinx common stock required to constitute a quorum attend.\nUnder Nasdaq rules, banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d on behalf of the\nbeneficial owner of such shares have the authority to vote such shares in their discretion on certain \u201croutine\u201d\nproposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners. However, banks,\nbrokers or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to matters that under\nNasdaq rules are \u201cnon-routine.\u201d This can result in a \u201cbroker non-vote,\u201d which occurs on an item when (i) a\nbank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more \u201croutine\u201d proposals to be\nvoted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other \u201cnon-routine\u201d proposals without\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank,\nbroker or other nominee with voting instructions on a \u201cnon-routine\u201d matter. All of the proposals before the\nXilinx special meeting are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d matters under Nasdaq rules, and banks, brokers or other\nnominees will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter before the Xilinx special meeting. As a\nresult, Xilinx does not expect any broker non-votes at the Xilinx special meeting and if you hold your shares of\nXilinx common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d your shares will not be represented and will not be voted on any matter\nunless you affirmatively instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance\nwith the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. It is therefore critical that you\ncast your vote by instructing your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Brokers will not be able to vote\non any of the proposals before the Xilinx special meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owners.\n65 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRequired Votes\nExcept for the Xilinx adjournment proposal, the vote required to approve each of the proposals listed below\nassumes the presence of a quorum at the Xilinx special meeting. As described above, Xilinx does not expect\nthere to be any broker non-votes at the Xilinx special meeting.\nProposal\nRequired Vote\nEffects of Certain Actions\nXilinx\nProposal 1:\nXilinx merger\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Xilinx common stock\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting\non the Xilinx merger proposal.\nAn abstention or other failure to vote on the\nXilinx merger proposal will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx merger\nproposal.\nXilinx\nProposal 2:\nXilinx\ncompensation\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Xilinx common stock\nvirtually present via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Xilinx\nspecial meeting, any shares not virtually\npresent or represented by proxy (including\ndue to the failure of a Xilinx stockholder who\nholds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a\nbank, broker or other nominee to provide\nvoting instructions to such bank, broker or\nother nominee) will have no effect on the\noutcome of the Xilinx compensation\nproposal.\nAn abstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting\non the Xilinx compensation proposal to vote\non the Xilinx compensation proposal will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Xilinx compensation proposal. In\naddition, if a Xilinx stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee provides voting\ninstructions for one or more other proposals,\nbut not for the Xilinx compensation proposal,\nit will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Xilinx compensation\nproposal.\nXilinx\nProposal 3:\nXilinx\nadjournment\nproposal\nApproval requires the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding shares of Xilinx common stock\nvirtually present via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting.\nAny shares not virtually present or\nrepresented by proxy (including due to the\nfailure of a Xilinx stockholder who holds\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee to provide voting\ninstructions to such bank, broker or other\nnominee) will have no effect on the outcome\nof the Xilinx adjournment proposal. An\nabstention or other failure of any shares\nvirtually present or represented by proxy and\nentitled to vote at the Xilinx special meeting\non the Xilinx adjournment proposal to vote\non the Xilinx adjournment proposal will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nXilinx adjournment proposal. In addition, if a\nXilinx stockholder who holds shares in\n\u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or\nother nominee provides voting instructions\nfor one or more other proposals, but not for\nthe Xilinx adjournment proposal, it will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nXilinx adjournment proposal.\n66 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVote of Xilinx Directors and Executive Officers\nAs of February 10, 2021, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,\nXilinx directors and executive officers, and their affiliates, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote less\nthan 1% of the total outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock.

You may also change your vote\nby obtaining your specific control number and instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee and\nvoting your shares at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nXilinx is soliciting proxies to provide an opportunity to all Xilinx stockholders to vote on agenda items,\nwhether or not such Xilinx stockholders are able to virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting or any\nadjournment or\n68 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npostponement thereof. Xilinx will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Xilinx stockholders. In addition\nto the solicitation of proxies by mail, Xilinx will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders\nsend proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Xilinx common stock and secure their voting\ninstructions, if necessary. Xilinx may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on\nrequest for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.\nXilinx has also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with Xilinx stockholders\nand estimates that it will pay them a fee of approximately $40,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket\nfees and expenses. Xilinx also has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that\nrelate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). Proxies may be solicited on\nbehalf of Xilinx or Xilinx directors, officers and other employees in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile,\nmessenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication. Xilinx\ndirectors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in\nthis regard.\nVirtually Attending the Xilinx Special Meeting\nIf you wish to virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website, you must (i) be\na Xilinx stockholder of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021 (the Xilinx record date), (ii) hold\nyour shares of Xilinx common stock beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee as of the Xilinx\nrecord date or (iii) hold a valid proxy for the Xilinx special meeting.\nTo enter the Xilinx special meeting website and virtually attend the Xilinx special meeting, you must first\nregister at the Xilinx special meeting website to obtain a unique meeting invitation by email. If you hold your\nshares of Xilinx common stock in street name beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee and you\nwish to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website, you must\nprovide a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee during registration to obtain a virtual control\nnumber. If you are unable to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, you will be able to\nregister to attend the Xilinx special meeting, but may not vote your shares at the Xilinx special meeting.\nIf you plan to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website,\nXilinx still encourages you to vote in advance by the internet, telephone or (if you received a paper copy of\nthe proxy materials) by mail so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to virtually attend\nthe Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special meeting website. Voting your proxy by the internet, telephone\nor mail will not limit your right to virtually attend and vote at the Xilinx special meeting via the Xilinx special\nmeeting website if you later decide to do so.\nHouseholding\nSEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy\nstatements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a\nsingle proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly\nreferred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d provides cost savings for companies. Xilinx has previously adopted\nhouseholding for Xilinx stockholders of record. As a result, Xilinx stockholders with the same address and last\nname may receive only one copy of this joint proxy statement /prospectus. Registered Xilinx stockholders\n(those who hold shares of Xilinx common stock directly in their name with Xilinx\u2019s transfer agent) may opt out\nof householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending\na written request to Xilinx at the address below.\nSome brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple Xilinx\nstockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected\nstockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to\nyour address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If,\nat any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy\nstatement or notice, or\n69 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nif your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future\ndeliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.\nXilinx will promptly deliver a copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any Xilinx stockholder who\nreceived only one copy of these materials due to householding upon request in writing to: Xilinx, Inc., Attn:\nInvestor Relations, ir@xilinx.com, 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124 or by calling (408) 626-4293.\nTabulation of Votes\nThe Xilinx board of directors will appoint an independent inspector of election for the Xilinx special meeting.\nThe inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the number of shares of Xilinx common stock\nrepresented at the Xilinx special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity of all\nproxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to Xilinx stockholders at the\nXilinx special meeting.\nAdjournments\nIf a quorum is present at the Xilinx special meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the Xilinx\nspecial meeting to approve the Xilinx merger proposal, then Xilinx stockholders may be asked to vote on the\nXilinx adjournment proposal.\nAt any subsequent reconvening of the Xilinx special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may\nbe transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same\nmanner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the Xilinx special meeting, except for any\nproxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened\nmeeting.\nAssistance\nIf you need assistance voting or completing your proxy card, or if you have questions regarding the Xilinx\nspecial meeting, please contact Innisfree, Xilinx\u2019s proxy solicitor for the Xilinx special meeting, at:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated \n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor \nNew York, New York 10022 \n(877) 717-3923 \nBanks and Brokers: (212) 750-5833\nXILINX STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/\u200bPROSPECTUS IN ITS\nENTIRETY FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE\nMERGER.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER\nThe following is a description of material aspects of the merger. While AMD and Xilinx believe that the\nfollowing description covers the material terms of the merger, the description may not contain all of the\ninformation that is important to you. You are encouraged to read carefully this entire joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, including the text of the merger agreement attached as Annex A hereto, for a more\ncomplete understanding of the merger. In addition, important business and financial information about each\nof AMD and Xilinx is contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nGeneral\nAMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have entered into the merger agreement, which provides for the merger of\nMerger Sub with and into Xilinx. As a result of the merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and\nXilinx will continue its existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of AMD. The surviving corporation will be named \u201cXilinx, Inc.\u201d\nMerger Consideration\nAt the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock (other than shares held in treasury by Xilinx or held\ndirectly by AMD or Merger Sub (which shares will be cancelled)) that was issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD\ncommon stock as well as cash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of any\nfractional shares of AMD common stock.\nThe exchange ratio is fixed, which means that it will not change between now and the date of the merger,\nregardless of whether the market price of AMD or Xilinx common stock changes. Therefore, the value of the\nmerger consideration will depend on the market price of AMD common stock at the effective time. The market\nprice of AMD common stock has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and\nis expected to continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the dates of the\nrespective AMD and Xilinx special meetings, through the date the merger is completed and thereafter. The\nmarket price of AMD common stock, when received by Xilinx stockholders in connection with the merger,\ncould be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of AMD common stock on the date of this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Xilinx special meeting. Accordingly, you should obtain\ncurrent market quotations for AMD and Xilinx common stock before deciding how to vote on any of the\nproposals described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. AMD common stock is traded on Nasdaq under\nthe symbol \u201cAMD\u201d and Xilinx common stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cXLNX.\u201d\nBackground of the Merger\nEach of AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s board of directors and senior management team regularly reviews their respective\ncompany\u2019s performance, future growth prospects and overall strategic direction and considers potential\nopportunities to strengthen their respective businesses and enhance stockholder value. These reviews have\nincluded consideration of whether the continued execution of each company\u2019s strategy or possible strategic\nopportunities, joint ventures or combination with third parties offered the best avenue to maximize stockholder\nvalue.\nFrom time to time over the past few years, AMD and Xilinx have had informal discussions regarding potential\nstrategic partnerships, collaborations and a potential combination between the two companies. In connection\nwith Xilinx\u2019s approach to AMD about a potential business combination of the two companies, on August 13,\n2018, AMD and Xilinx signed a mutual non-disclosure agreement. Xilinx is not a party or subject to any non-\ndisclosure or other agreement with a party other than AMD, including with Company A (as defined below),\nwith respect to a potential business combination that includes any standstill or \u201cdon\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-waive\u201d\nprovision that would inhibit such party from making a proposal. Shortly thereafter, the parties\u2019 management\nteams presented\n74 TABLE OF CONTENTS\noverviews of their respective businesses in order to assess support for the strategic logic of a combination,\nbut due to deal structuring and timing issues, these discussions were put on hold. While Dr. Lisa Su,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of AMD and Victor Peng, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx,\nstayed in touch over time, no proposals (binding or non-binding) were exchanged between the parties until\n2020. The Xilinx board of directors (the \u201cXilinx Board\u201d) understood that Mr. Peng would be meeting with Dr.\nSu, and potentially representatives of other potential counterparties, from time to time and directed that Mr.\nPeng report to the Xilinx Board if these discussions solidified at a suitable time for Xilinx to consider engaging\nin a business combination with AMD or another potential counterparty.\nOn August 19, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting to discuss a potential business combination between\nXilinx and AMD. On October 8, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met and continued their discussions of a potential\nbusiness combination between the parties. During these discussions, Dr. Su and Mr. Peng discussed a variety\nof matters, including semiconductor market dynamics, the rationale for AMD acquiring Xilinx and the\nimportance of retaining key personnel in any proposed combination. Dr. Su communicated that Mr. Peng\u2019s\nleadership in the combined company would be important for the success of the combination to provide\ncontinuity for the Xilinx business. Dr. Su noted that she envisioned that Mr. Peng would be a close partner\nwith her in the combined company, and they discussed, without any commitment or specific proposal on roles,\nthat Mr. Peng would be well-positioned from a leadership standpoint in the combined company should a\ncombination occur. Mr. Peng noted that this was not the right time for Xilinx to engage in discussions on a\ncombination with AMD but that because the strategic rationale for combining the companies was compelling,\nit made sense to continue to stay in contact.\nOn November 19, 2019, the AMD board of directors (the \u201cAMD Board\u201d) held a meeting with members of senior\nmanagement and representatives of DBO Partners LLC (\u201cDBO\u201d), who had previously discussed strategic\nalternatives with the AMD Board, in attendance. The AMD Board discussed with its advisors and senior\nmanagement potential strategic transactions that AMD may want to consider, including a potential transaction\nbetween AMD and Xilinx.\nOn December 8, 2019, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management and representatives\nof DBO attending. Each of Dr. Su and DBO provided the AMD Board with an analysis of a potential strategic\ntransaction with Xilinx. The AMD Board discussed possible strategies for approaching Xilinx regarding a\npotential strategic transaction and authorized Dr. Su to approach Mr. Peng with a non-binding proposal.\nOn December 9, 2019, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met, and Dr. Su conveyed to Mr. Peng that AMD was prepared to\nmake a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx. Mr. Peng reiterated that this was not the right time for Xilinx to\nengage in discussions on a combination with AMD but that he would discuss it with Dennis Segers, Chairman\nof the Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng and Dr. Su agreed to meet again after the New Year.\nOn December 10, 2019, Mr. Peng and the Chief Executive Officer of another semiconductor company\n(\u201cCompany A\u201d) were both participants in a broader, pre-scheduled meeting, following which the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Company A asked to speak with Mr. Peng separately. At the meeting, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Company A conveyed Company A\u2019s interest in exploring a potential business combination with\nXilinx. Mr. Peng responded that the timing was difficult at this time and suggested speaking again after the\nholidays.\nOn December 20, 2019, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management attending. Dr. Su\nprovided an update to the AMD Board on her discussions with Mr. Peng regarding an acquisition of Xilinx by\nAMD. She noted that they arranged to meet again on January 2, 2020 to discuss the rationale for a strategic\ntransaction in more detail.\nOn January 2, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met to further discuss a potential acquisition of Xilinx by AMD, and,\nto that end, Dr. Su made a presentation to Mr. Peng summarizing at a high level AMD\u2019s business, product\nroadmaps and financial overview as well as potential synergies and benefits that could be achieved through a\ncombination with Xilinx, without proposing a price or other terms. Mr. Peng noted that the timing remained\nchallenging, particularly given the transaction consideration would likely be all-stock or stock-rich and recent\nfluctuations in each party\u2019s respective stock price, but he agreed to consider the concept in consultation with\nthe Xilinx Board.\n75 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 16, 2020, Mr. Peng communicated to Dr. Su that the Xilinx Board had been updated on the\ndiscussions between Mr. Peng and Dr. Su and that the Xilinx Board was continuing to consider whether to\nengage in a potential transaction with AMD. Mr. Peng noted the Xilinx Board had several concerns, including\nwith respect to the fluctuations of both companies\u2019 stock prices in a stock-rich transaction and that AMD\nwould need to make a compelling offer to address these risks and provide adequate downside protection to\nXilinx stockholders. Dr. Su stated that she was aiming to provide a non-binding indication of interest to Xilinx\nin the second half of February.\nOn January 23, 2020, at the Chief Executive Officer of Company A\u2019s request, Mr. Peng met with the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Company A, who made a presentation to Mr. Peng summarizing at a high level Company\nA\u2019s business and perspectives on a potential combination with Xilinx. Mr. Peng noted that the timing was\ndifficult from a business perspective to consider combining the two companies\u2019 businesses. The Chief\nExecutive Officer of Company A agreed to follow up sometime in the future, with no specific timeframe for\nreconnecting.\nOn February 11 and 12, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of DBO and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (\u201cCredit Suisse\u201d) attending. Dr. Su discussed\nthe timing of an offer and Mr. Peng\u2019s potential role after the proposed transaction. Representatives of DBO\nand Credit Suisse provided a review of Xilinx\u2019s earnings, stock price performance, and preliminary analysis.\nThe AMD Board approved submission of a non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.\nOn February 14, 2020, AMD formally retained DBO as a financial advisor to AMD as it related to the\ncontemplated transaction between AMD and Xilinx. After considering multiple banks of high quality and\nreputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with respect to a transaction between AMD and Xilinx as\npotential financial advisors to the AMD Board, and after discussing each bank\u2019s experience, expertise and\nqualifications, the AMD Board selected DBO on the basis of its qualifications, expertise and reputation, its\nknowledge and understanding of AMD\u2019s business, industry and affairs, and the absence of any conflicts with\nrespect to Xilinx.\nOn February 16, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a telephone call, during which Dr. Su conveyed that the AMD\nBoard had authorized a non-binding proposal, and that she would be seeking a response by March 2, 2020.\nLater on February 16, 2020, Dr. Su delivered to Mr. Peng a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx at a price of\n$115.00 per share of Xilinx common stock, comprised of $15.00 per share in cash and $100.00 per share in\nshares of AMD common stock.\nOn February 20, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), Xilinx\u2019s outside legal advisor,\nattending. At the meeting, Mr. Peng reported on AMD\u2019s February 16 proposal. Also at this meeting,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), who had provided strategic financial\nadvice to Xilinx on other occasions, were invited to present to the Xilinx Board. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley reviewed certain financial aspects of Xilinx. The Xilinx Board discussed the current prospects of Xilinx\non a standalone basis, including potential upside opportunities to create value for Xilinx stockholders as well\nas potential headwinds over the near to medium term. The Xilinx Board determined that, although they saw the\npotential strategic logic behind a combination with AMD, the February 16 proposal was not at a sufficient\nvaluation level to warrant a counterproposal or price guidance to AMD at this time. The Xilinx Board\nconsidered how best to respond by AMD\u2019s requested deadline of March 2, 2020. In addition, Mr. Peng\nprovided an update to the Xilinx Board on Mr. Peng\u2019s recent meetings with the Chief Executive Officer of\nCompany A. After discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that certain recent activity at Company A would\nrender a transaction of the size necessary for a combination with Xilinx challenging from a business execution\nperspective and directed that Mr. Peng deliver this message to Company A. At this meeting, and at nearly\nevery subsequent meeting of the Xilinx Board leading up to the public announcement of the merger, the Xilinx\nBoard met in executive session with only independent directors and representatives of Skadden present.\nBecause no Xilinx director (other than potentially Mr. Peng, who did not participate in such executive\nsessions) had a conflict of interest with respect to a transaction between AMD and Xilinx, no special\ncommittee of independent directors of the Xilinx Board was established.\n76 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 28, 2020, the Xilinx Board held another meeting, at which they further discussed a potential\ntransaction with AMD. A representative of Skadden discussed the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in the context of\nconsidering a strategic transaction and various considerations that should be part of the Xilinx Board\u2019s\ndecision-making process. Also at this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed its preliminary\nviews on certain financial aspects of AMD. After discussions, the Xilinx Board reiterated its previous\nconsensus view that while a combination with AMD could potentially result in significant upside opportunity\nfor Xilinx stockholders, the February 16 proposal was not sufficiently compelling to serve as a starting point\nfor negotiations or warrant a counterproposal or price guidance. The Xilinx Board also determined that it was\nimportant for AMD to understand the uniqueness of Xilinx as an asset and the meaningful contribution to the\nvalue of the combined company that Xilinx would bring, which in turn requires a greater valuation and\npercentage ownership of the combined company. The Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to deliver this message\nto AMD.\nLater on February 28, 2020, Mr. Peng spoke to Dr. Su by telephone and conveyed the message as directed by\nthe Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng and Dr. Su agreed to meet on March 2, 2020 to discuss further, with Dr. Su noting\nthat AMD would not have a revised proposal at that time.\nOn March 2, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su met as scheduled. Mr. Peng conveyed the considerations that were of\nparticular importance to the Xilinx Board as it related to a potential transaction, emphasizing the importance of\na significant premium to acknowledge the uniqueness of Xilinx as an asset and the meaningful contribution\nthat Xilinx would bring to the combined company and downside protection for Xilinx stockholders given\nrecent fluctuations in AMD\u2019s share price. Dr. Su agreed to consider these points, and they agreed to speak\nagain on March 6, 2020.\nOn March 6, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by telephone. Dr. Su stated that AMD was not in a position to\nprovide a revised proposal and probed for guidance on price and other terms and to potentially engage in\npreliminary due diligence in order to support any changes to AMD\u2019s February 16 proposal. Mr. Peng\nresponded that Xilinx was also not in a different place from the prior indications and that the Xilinx Board\nneeded the proposal price to increase before engaging in further discussions.\nOn March 9, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting with members of management and representatives of DBO,\nCredit Suisse and Latham and Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d) attending. Dr. Su provided an update to the AMD\nBoard on recent discussions with Mr. Peng. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse reviewed alternatives\nfor an updated acquisition proposal and potential effects. The AMD Board approved submission of a second\nnon-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.\nOn March 10, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by telephone. Dr. Su noted that after a meeting of the\nAMD Board the previous day, the AMD Board was still supportive of a potential transaction with Xilinx and\nwould target providing a revised proposal in one week\u2019s time. Dr. Su acknowledged that this timing would\nmiss Xilinx\u2019s next regularly scheduled board meeting, which was scheduled for March 11 and 12, 2020.\nOn March 11 and 12, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Among other topics, members\nof Xilinx senior management gave an update to the Xilinx Board on COVID-19, which was a rapidly evolving\nsituation, as it related to Xilinx and its personnel as well as the broader marketplace. In addition, Mr. Peng\nprovided an update on his recent discussions with Dr. Su with respect to a potential business combination\nand also reported to the Xilinx Board in detail his October 8, 2019 discussion with Dr. Su, including the\nimportance of Mr. Peng\u2019s leadership role in the combined company to provide continuity for the Xilinx\nbusiness if the companies were to combine. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain preliminary\nfinancial analyses. After discussions, the Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to communicate to AMD that any\nrevised proposal should provide for an all-stock deal and use an exchange ratio rather than a fixed price given\nthe volatility in the market. Also on March 12, 2020, Morgan Stanley delivered to the Xilinx Board a\nrelationship disclosure, which did not contain any issues of note.\nLater on March 12, 2020, Mr. Peng met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to convey the message\nas directed by the Xilinx Board at its March 11 and 12, 2020 meeting. Mr. Peng suggested that the parties\n77 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreconnect in the fall if the market environment, in light of COVID-19 and other factors, and Company A\u2019s\nbusiness, were more settled.\nOn March 13, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to communicate the direction provided by the\nXilinx Board about a revised proposal. Dr. Su responded that the AMD Board and AMD\u2019s outside advisors\nagreed that using an exchange ratio was the appropriate way to proceed.\nAlso on March 13, 2020, AMD entered into an engagement letter with Credit Suisse as an additional financial\nadvisor to AMD as it related to the contemplated transaction between AMD and Xilinx. After discussing the\npotential advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor as a complement to DBO, and\nconsidering the magnitude of the potential transaction and the benefits of having an additional perspective\nthroughout the process, the AMD Board selected Credit Suisse based on its qualifications, experience and\nreputation as an internationally recognized investment banking and financial advisory firm.\nOn March 16, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives\nof DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Dr. Su summarized for the AMD Board her conversations with Mr. Peng\nsince the previous board meeting. Representatives from DBO and Credit Suisse reviewed proposed terms and\nconsiderations for the acquisition proposal. The AMD Board approved submission of a revised non-binding\nproposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.\nOn March 17, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone to communicate a revised non-binding proposal\nwith a fixed exchange ratio of 2.2 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, which\nresulted in an illustrative purchase price of approximately $92.14 per share of Xilinx common stock based on\nAMD\u2019s closing trading price on the date of the proposal. Dr. Su delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written\nform after the call. Mr. Peng subsequently discussed the proposal with Mr. Segers and, consistent with the\ndiscussions of the Xilinx Board during its March 11 and 12, 2020 meetings, discussed that, at this level, the\nXilinx Board had already determined that the proposal was at an insufficient valuation to engage in\nsubstantive discussions and agreed that Mr. Peng should deliver that message to Dr. Su.\nOn March 19, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to deliver the message that the revised proposal\nwas not sufficient from a price perspective and that, given the unprecedented market volatility, the parties\nshould stop discussions and check back in when the market environment, in light of COVID-19 and other\nfactors, was more settled. Mr. Peng suggested they might revisit a potential combination again in the fall.\nThere were no further substantive discussions between AMD and Xilinx until August 4, 2020.\nOn March 20, 2020 and March 21, 2020, Dr. Su communicated to the AMD Board the substance of her March\n19 conversation with Mr. Peng.\nOn May 6, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management attending. The AMD\nBoard discussed the status of possible strategic transactions and collaborations, including a potential\nacquisition of Xilinx by AMD. Dr. Su confirmed that Xilinx had rejected AMD\u2019s March 17 proposal and that\nthere were no active discussions between AMD and Xilinx.\nOn July 13, 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A requested a video call with Mr. Peng, at which the\nChief Executive Officer of Company A discussed certain updates on Company A\u2019s business and also\nconveyed that Company A would be delivering a non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx at a price of $120.00\nper share of Xilinx common stock, comprised of $40.00 in cash and $80.00 in shares of Company A common\nstock. The Chief Executive Officer noted that the leadership at Company A included a number of executives\nfrom companies that Company A had previously acquired and suggested that a combination with Xilinx would\nfollow that track record, and perhaps to a greater extent considering the relative size of Xilinx\u2019s business and\nthe potential combination with Xilinx compared to past acquisitions, without getting into specifics about the\npotential combined company management. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A delivered the proposal\nto\n78 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMr. Peng in writing after the call. Mr. Peng informed Mr. Segers of the proposal from Company A, and Mr.\nSegers informed the Xilinx Board.\nOn August 3, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on Company A\u2019s July 13 proposal.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed certain historical information with respect to Xilinx\u2019s\nfinancial performance, as well as preliminary financial analyses with respect to a potential transaction\ninvolving Company A or AMD. The Xilinx Board also discussed perspectives regarding the strategic rationale\nfor pursuing a potential transaction with either Company A or AMD as well as Xilinx\u2019s standalone strategic\nplan, including certain execution risks related thereto, and other potential strategic counterparties for Xilinx.\nAfter discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that not only did Company A\u2019s July 13 proposal significantly\nundervalue Xilinx, but also that a potential combination with Company A posed substantial risks from both a\nregulatory approval and execution perspective, and therefore Company A\u2019s proposal did not warrant a\ncounterproposal or further discussion at this time. The Xilinx Board directed Mr. Peng to deliver this message\nto Company A.\u200b\nOn August 4, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su were both participants in a broader, pre-scheduled video call,\nfollowing which Dr. Su asked to speak with Mr. Peng separately. Dr. Su communicated that given the current\nmacroeconomic climate and resilience of the semiconductor sector, she wanted to revisit extending a revised\nnon-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx. Mr. Peng responded that although the timing was still not ideal from\nXilinx\u2019s perspective, and noted that when they last spoke, they had talked about possibly revisiting\ndiscussions regarding a potential business combination in the fall, he would inform the Xilinx Board of this\ndevelopment. Dr. Su reported that the AMD Board was meeting later that week and that she would contact Mr.\nPeng thereafter.\nOn August 6 and 7, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse provided a\nsummary of the overall semiconductor landscape, potential strategic alternatives including the transaction\nwith Xilinx and noted that because of the current macroeconomic climate and resilience of the semiconductor\nsector, it was an attractive time to consider restarting discussions to acquire Xilinx. The AMD Board approved\nsubmission of a third non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD, which was delivered\nto Xilinx on August 9, 2020.\nOn August 8, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A by telephone to deliver the\nmessage as directed by the Xilinx Board at its August 3, 2020 meeting. Mr. Peng noted that if Company A were\nto submit a revised proposal that addressed the Xilinx Board\u2019s concerns surrounding both valuation and the\nregulatory approval and execution risks, he would bring that revised proposal to the Xilinx Board for\nconsideration. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A agreed to consider this feedback with the board of\ndirectors of Company A and implied there would be a response to Xilinx thereafter but did not commit to a\nspecific timing or format for the response.\nOn August 9, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone and conveyed that, as authorized by the AMD\nBoard, she would be delivering a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx in an acquisition in which\n100% of the outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock would be exchanged for shares of AMD common\nstock at a price of $132.50 per share of Xilinx common stock, with the final exchange ratio to be determined\nprior to signing a definitive agreement. Dr. Su delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written form after the call.\nOn August 13, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending, at which Mr. Peng and Mr. Segers updated the Xilinx Board on\nAMD\u2019s August 9 proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed certain preliminary financial analyses\nof AMD and Xilinx. The Xilinx Board discussed relative advantages and disadvantages of a combination with\nAMD compared to Company A and other potential counterparties, as well as continuing on a standalone\nbasis. Following the discussion, the Xilinx Board authorized Xilinx management to engage in a discussion with\nAMD regarding its August 9 proposal with a view toward improving that offer. The Xilinx Board also\nauthorized Xilinx\n79 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement to continue discussions with Morgan Stanley around potentially engaging them in connection\nwith Xilinx\u2019s review of potential strategic transactions. In addition, Mr. Segers reported that he had received\noutreach from the Chairperson of the board of directors of Company A, who wanted to speak with him. The\nXilinx Board determined that Mr. Segers should speak with the Chairperson of the Board of Company A within\nthe next week and, consistent with the message that Mr. Peng had already conveyed to the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Company A on August 8, 2020, reiterate the Xilinx Board\u2019s view that Company A\u2019s July 13 proposal\nsignificantly undervalued Xilinx and was not sufficient to warrant a counterproposal or further discussion at\nthis time.\nOn August 17, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by video call. Mr. Peng communicated that, while the Xilinx\nBoard had seriously considered AMD\u2019s August 9 proposal, the price would need to significantly improve in\norder for the Xilinx Board to authorize engagement in an initial management meeting. In accordance with the\nXilinx Board\u2019s instructions, Mr. Peng suggested that an improved offer of greater than $140.00 per share of\nXilinx common stock would likely enable further discussions.\nOn August 24, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives\nof DBO and Credit Suisse attending. Dr. Su provided an update on recent discussions she had with Mr. Peng\nand discussed the feedback provided by Mr. Peng on August 17. Representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse\nreviewed with the AMD Board potential responses to the Xilinx feedback, next steps and a proposed timeline.\nThe AMD Board approved a fourth non-binding proposal related to an acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.\nOn August 25, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by video call, during which Dr. Su communicated a\nrevised non-binding proposal to acquire Xilinx in an acquisition in which 100% of the outstanding shares of\nXilinx common stock would be exchanged for shares of AMD common stock at a price of $137.00 per share of\nXilinx common stock, with the final exchange ratio to be determined prior to signing a definitive agreement. Dr.\nSu delivered the proposal to Mr. Peng in written form after the call.\nOn August 28, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting to discuss AMD\u2019s August 25 proposal, with members of\nsenior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Skadden attending. Representatives of\nMorgan Stanley provided preliminary financial analyses with respect to the August 25 proposal, and\nrepresentatives of Skadden reviewed the Xilinx Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in these circumstances, including as it\nrelated to Company A and potential other counterparties. The Xilinx Board determined that the appropriate\nnext step would be for AMD and Xilinx to each deliver a management presentation, and then Xilinx would\nprovide a counterproposal to AMD following the presentations. In view of the current status of the\ndiscussions and that the parties would be moving forward, the Xilinx Board also discussed engaging BofA\nSecurities as a second financial advisor, given BofA Securities\u2019 expertise in the semiconductor industry and\nfamiliarity with AMD and Xilinx, which the Xilinx Board felt would be helpful as a complement to Morgan\nStanley, given the magnitude of the potential transaction, the importance of the investment decision, and also\nbecause it would be helpful to have a second perspective while going through this process. The Xilinx Board\nalso weighed the potential advantages and disadvantages of having two financial advisors. After discussions,\nthe Xilinx Board directed Xilinx management to reach out to BofA Securities to discuss a potential engagement\nand determine if there might be any potential conflicts of interest.\nLater on August 28, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by video call to deliver the message that while the Xilinx\nBoard was open to proceeding with mutual management meetings, the Xilinx Board was not prepared to\nsupport a transaction on the terms of AMD\u2019s August 25 proposal. Mr. Peng noted that the Xilinx Board\nremained focused on the right intersection of the appropriate risk-adjusted value for Xilinx stockholders based\non Xilinx\u2019s potential intrinsic value, the percentage of the combined company that Xilinx stockholders would\nultimately own and the companies\u2019 relative contributions. Mr. Peng suggested that, given the Xilinx Board had\na regular board meeting scheduled during the week of September 7, 2020, it would make sense for AMD\u2019s\nmanagement meeting to take place in advance of the Xilinx Board meeting, and Xilinx\u2019s management meeting\ncould take place right after the Xilinx Board meeting on September 11, 2020. Dr. Su agreed to proceed with\nmutual management meetings and noted she would discuss the sequencing and logistics with John Caldwell,\nChairman of the AMD Board.\n80 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 29, 2020, a representative of Xilinx management reached out to BofA Securities to discuss\npotentially engaging BofA Securities as a second financial advisor to Xilinx in connection with Xilinx\u2019s review\nof potential strategic transactions.\nOn August 30, 2020, Dr. Su contacted Mr. Peng by telephone to communicate that AMD would be able to\nprovide a management presentation to Xilinx on September 7, 2020, which would enable Xilinx management to\nprovide an update to the Xilinx Board during their meeting. Dr. Su also offered to speak with the Xilinx Board\nduring their meeting, and Mr. Peng agreed it would be good for her to speak directly to the Xilinx Board about\nAMD\u2019s business and her point of view on the potential combination.\nOn August 31, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by telephone to discuss the logistics of the upcoming\nmeetings.\nOn September 5, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and a\nrepresentative of Latham attending. The AMD Board reviewed and discussed Xilinx\u2019s response to AMD\u2019s\nproposal, the overall plans for due diligence and AMD\u2019s preliminary long-range financial plan that would be\nshared with Xilinx in the upcoming management presentation.\nOn September 7, 2020, representatives of AMD management provided a management presentation to\nrepresentatives of Xilinx management.\nFrom September 8 through September 10, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with\nmembers of senior management attending and representatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and\nSkadden attending for certain portions. Among other topics discussed, members of senior management\nreported to the Xilinx Board their findings from the management presentation that AMD had given to Xilinx,\nfocusing in particular on the areas of engineering, product and technology. Then, representatives of each of\nMorgan Stanley and BofA Securities discussed with the Xilinx Board AMD\u2019s management presentation from a\nfinancial perspective. Representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities also discussed with the\nXilinx Board certain preliminary financial analyses of AMD and Xilinx. That afternoon, Dr. Su presented to the\nindependent directors of the Xilinx Board her strategic vision for AMD and the rationale supporting a\ntransaction with Xilinx, and Dr. Su expressed her view that Mr. Peng\u2019s continued leadership in the combined\ncompany would be critical in order to provide business continuity for the Xilinx business and realize the\nanticipated benefits of a transaction. After Dr. Su\u2019s presentation, the Xilinx Board discussed their perspectives\non a potential transaction with AMD and began formulating a view on the appropriate counterproposal.\nOn September 11, 2020, representatives of Xilinx management provided a management presentation to\nrepresentatives of AMD management.\nLater on September 11, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of Skadden attending. At the meeting, members of senior management provided the Xilinx\nBoard with an update on the Xilinx management presentation to AMD that had taken place earlier that day. In\naddition, after reviewing the proposed terms of the engagements with Morgan Stanley as lead financial\nadvisor and BofA Securities as a second financial advisor for this matter, as well as their respective\nrelationship disclosures, the Xilinx Board unanimously approved the engagement of each of Morgan Stanley\nand BofA Securities in accordance with their respective terms. After considering multiple banks of high\nquality and reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with respect to a transaction between Xilinx and\nAMD as potential financial advisors to the Xilinx Board, and after discussing each bank\u2019s experience,\nexpertise and qualifications, the Xilinx Board selected (i) Morgan Stanley due to its qualifications, experience\nand reputation, its knowledge and involvement in recent transactions in the industry, its knowledge of Xilinx\u2019s\nbusiness and affairs, and the absence of any material conflicts with respect to AMD and (ii) after discussing\nthe advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor, given the magnitude of the\npotential transaction, the importance of the investment decision and also because it would be helpful to have\na second perspective while going through the process, BofA Securities due to its experience in transactions\nsimilar to the contemplated transaction, its reputation in the investment community, its familiarity with Xilinx\nand its business, and the absence of any material conflicts with\n81 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespect to AMD. The Xilinx Board also instructed Mr. Peng not to discuss his own potential compensation as\npart of the combined company with representatives of AMD unless and until the Xilinx Board consents to\nsuch discussion, and Mr. Peng confirmed there had been no such discussions to date and accepted the Xilinx\nBoard\u2019s instruction. After discussions, including as to the information provided at the September 10, 2020\nmeeting, the Xilinx Board authorized Mr. Peng to propose to AMD an all-stock transaction valued at $145.00\nper share of Xilinx common stock, with some form of downside protection against the fluctuations of AMD\u2019s\nstock but also an ability to participate in the upside, as well as proportionate representation on the post-\nclosing AMD Board.\nOn September 13, 2020, Mr. Peng spoke to Dr. Su by video call and conveyed Xilinx\u2019s non-binding\ncounterproposal as authorized by the Xilinx Board. Mr. Peng noted that for the downside protection element,\nthe Xilinx Board was open-minded between a downside collar (i.e., setting a minimum value for the exchange\nratio) and a cash/stock election (i.e., Xilinx stockholders could decide closer to closing if they wanted to\nreceive cash, up to a specified, capped amount, or stock, based on AMD\u2019s then-current stock price). Mr. Peng\nalso conveyed the Xilinx Board\u2019s request for proportionate representation on the post-closing AMD Board.\nOn September 14, 2020, at the direction of AMD and Xilinx, as applicable, representatives of Morgan Stanley,\nBofA Securities, DBO and Credit Suisse had a telephone call to discuss pricing mechanisms that could\ntheoretically be used in a potential transaction between the parties.\nAlso on September 14, 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A contacted Mr. Peng by telephone and\nconveyed that Company A had been working on revising its July 13 proposal into a true \u201cmerger of equals\u201d\ntransaction, with the current Chief Executive Officer of either Company A or Xilinx serving as the Chief\nExecutive Officer of the combined company, with the other serving as Chairperson of the combined company,\nand a combined company board being comprised 50% of Company A directors and 50% of Xilinx directors.\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Company A noted that Company A was prepared to deliver a written non-\nbinding proposal to Xilinx but would not do so if the timing was not suitable for Xilinx. Mr. Peng agreed to\nconsider this concept in consultation with the Xilinx Board and then provide a response. After the call, Mr.\nPeng updated Mr. Segers on this conversation and determined that he and Mr. Segers would provide an\nupdate to the Xilinx Board at the next meeting to determine the appropriate response to Company A.\nOn September 16, 2020, Xilinx formally engaged Morgan Stanley as its lead financial advisor and BofA\nSecurities as its second financial advisor and executed an engagement letter with each of Morgan Stanley and\nBofA Securities.\nOn September 17, 2020, the AMD Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of DBO, Credit Suisse and Latham attending. Dr. Su provided an update to the AMD Board on\nher discussions with Xilinx\u2019s directors and executive team. Dr. Su reviewed Xilinx\u2019s technology capabilities,\nrisk factors, growth prospects and long term financial targets. AMD management provided its preliminary due\ndiligence findings to the AMD Board and discussed potential synergies between AMD and Xilinx.\nRepresentatives of DBO and Credit Suisse discussed the deal structure considerations relating to the latest\ncounterproposal from Xilinx. The AMD Board then discussed potential responses to Xilinx\u2019s counterproposal\nand approved a counterproposal of (i) an exchange ratio representing a purchase price of $139.00 per share\n(without any collar mechanism) and (ii) the addition of two members of the Xilinx board of directors. The AMD\nBoard also approved the formation of a transaction committee (the \u201cAMD Transaction Committee\u201d),\nconsisting of Messrs. Caldwell and Joe Householder, for purposes of convenience and efficiency, with the\nauthority to oversee and administer the day-to-day process with respect to the potential acquisition of Xilinx\nby AMD.\nOn September 19, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting, at which Dr. Su conveyed a revised proposal to\nacquire Xilinx in a transaction in which 100% of the outstanding shares of Xilinx common stock would be\nexchanged for shares of AMD common stock at a price of $139.00 per share of Xilinx common stock, with the\nfinal exchange ratio to be determined prior to signing a definitive agreement, and to appoint two Xilinx\ndirectors to the post-closing company board. Dr. Su expressed the AMD Board\u2019s concerns regarding either\nform of downside protection that the Xilinx Board had suggested, insofar as it could be construed as a lack of\nconfidence on the part of the Xilinx Board in the transaction.\n82 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 20, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on AMD\u2019s\nSeptember 19 proposal. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Xilinx Board with certain preliminary\nfinancial analyses. After discussions, the Xilinx Board determined that, based on the feedback received from\nthe AMD Board, it seemed highly unlikely that the AMD Board would support any transaction that included\ndownside protection at the time of announcement and, in view of AMD\u2019s perspective, the Xilinx Board should,\nin the negotiations, focus instead on maximizing value for Xilinx stockholders rather than downside protection.\nOn that basis, the Xilinx Board determined that the appropriate counterproposal on price would be that if\nAMD\u2019s price per share, based on a 10-day unaffected VWAP ending on the last business day before signing a\ndefinitive agreement (the \u201cAMD announcement price\u201d), were $70.00 or lower, the \u201cXilinx transaction price\u201d\nwould be $140.00 per share\u037e if the AMD announcement price were $80.00 or higher, the Xilinx transaction price\nwould be $145.00\u037e and if the AMD announcement price were between $70.00 and 80.00, the Xilinx transaction\nprice would be linearly interpolated between $140.00 and $145.00, with the exchange ratio to be calculated by\ndividing the Xilinx transaction price by the AMD announcement price. The Xilinx Board also directed Mr. Peng\nto request three seats for Xilinx directors on the post-closing company board in order to be more proportionate\nto Xilinx stockholders\u2019 implied pro forma ownership. In the event that AMD continued to reject Xilinx\u2019s\nstructured proposals on price, the Xilinx Board also gave Mr. Peng guidance on the price threshold at which\nthey would be prepared to accept a deal, subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence and negotiation of\na mutually acceptable definitive agreement. Also at the meeting, Mr. Peng reported to the Xilinx Board on his\nrecent conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A. Mr. Peng noted that a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d\noffer with Company A as the acquirer would result in an offer price of approximately $101.00, while Company\nA\u2019s prior proposal from July 13, 2020 included an offer price of $120.00. The Xilinx Board determined that from\nan offer price perspective, as well as taking into account that it was unlikely, from a financial point of view, that\nCompany A could do anything to meaningfully improve its proposal, and given the latest proposal from AMD\nwas valued at $139.00, it would not be worthwhile to engage with Company A at this time, and authorized Mr.\nPeng to respond to Company A accordingly. The Xilinx Board also considered the risks and benefits of\nperforming a further \u201cmarket check\u201d to assess whether a transaction that offered greater immediate value to\nXilinx stockholders was reasonably available as compared to the transaction proposed by AMD, in terms of\nprice, timing, likelihood of consummation, regulatory and other considerations, and the effect such \u201cmarket\ncheck\u201d would have on AMD\u2019s engagement and interest. The Xilinx Board also considered that any \u201cmarket\ncheck\u201d could result in public leaks of a potential sale process, which could also have an adverse impact on\nemployees, customers and external partners. The Xilinx Board concluded that a \u201cmarket check\u201d was unlikely to\nresult in a better outcome for Xilinx stockholders.\u200b\nAlso on September 20, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting and Mr. Peng delivered the counterproposal\nas directed by the Xilinx Board.\nOn September 21, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to deliver the response\nas directed by the Xilinx Board. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A responded with understanding and\nnoted that the parties could reconnect another time if it made sense to do so down the line.\nAlso on September 21, 2020, the AMD Transaction Committee met, with Dr. Su, members of senior management\nand representatives of DBO and Credit Suisse attending. The AMD Transaction Committee approved a revised\nproposal in response to Xilinx\u2019s September 20  proposal.\nOn September 22, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su had a meeting. During the meeting, Dr. Su communicated a revised\nproposal, wherein if the AMD announcement price were $73.00 or lower, the \u201cXilinx transaction price\u201d would\nbe $140.00 per share\u037e if the AMD announcement price were $83.00 or higher, the Xilinx transaction price would\nbe $143.00\u037e and if the AMD announcement price were between $73.00 and $83.00, the Xilinx transaction price\nwould be interpolated between $140.00 and $143.00 using $141.00 as the midpoint, with the exchange ratio to\nbe calculated by dividing the Xilinx transaction price by the AMD announcement price. Dr. Su also reiterated\nthat maintaining a relatively small post-closing AMD Board continued to be important, such that only two\nXilinx\n83 \nth\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndirectors would be offered positions on the AMD Board. Dr. Su stated that this was AMD\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d\nproposal. Shortly after this meeting, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone and conveyed that, before taking\nAMD\u2019s revised proposal to the Xilinx Board, he wanted to adjust the midpoint Xilinx transaction price to be\n$141.50, rather than $141.00, so there would be symmetry between the $140.00 and $143.00 guardrails, and\nnoted he anticipated that this element of fairness would be important to the Xilinx Board. Dr. Su responded\nthat, while she was not currently authorized by the AMD Board to agree to this adjustment, she confirmed her\nunderstanding that Mr. Peng would be taking AMD\u2019s proposal as adjusted in this manner to the Xilinx Board,\nand, if approved by the AMD Board, that this proposal as adjusted would be AMD\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d\nproposal (the \u201cFinal AMD Proposal\u201d).\nOn September 22, 2020, the Xilinx Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities and Skadden attending. Mr. Peng reported on the Final\nAMD Proposal and the latest discussions with Dr. Su around both price and board representation. After\ndiscussions, the Xilinx Board unanimously agreed to the economic terms of the Final AMD Proposal, subject\nto satisfactory completion of due diligence and negotiation of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement, but\nalso requested that Mr. Peng convey to Dr. Su that, while they would not terminate discussions over the issue\nof two versus three seats for Xilinx directors on the post-closing AMD Board, the Xilinx Board would\nappreciate consideration of a third seat, both for proportionate representation from a pro forma ownership\nperspective and also to ensure sufficient understanding of the Xilinx business on the post-closing AMD\nBoard.\nLater on September 22, 2020, Mr. Peng contacted Dr. Su by telephone to convey the message as directed by\nthe Xilinx Board. Dr. Su responded that she would discuss with the AMD Board and respond the following\nday.\nOn September 23, 2020, the AMD Transaction Committee met, with Dr. Su and members of senior management\npresent, and approved Xilinx\u2019s September 22 counterproposal.\nLater on September 23, 2020, Dr. Su delivered to Mr. Peng a document reflecting the agreed-upon price terms\nas set forth in the Final AMD Proposal and a post-closing AMD Board representation of at least two Xilinx\ndirectors with up to three Xilinx directors at AMD\u2019s discretion. The parties agreed to proceed expeditiously to\nnegotiate a mutually acceptable definitive agreement and to complete their respective due diligence reviews,\nsubject to further review and approval by the parties\u2019 respective boards.\nLater on September 23, 2020, representatives of Skadden delivered to Latham a draft NDA amendment to\nrevive the standstill and non-solicit provisions of the parties\u2019 existing NDA, which had previously expired, a\ndraft clean team agreement and a draft joint defense agreement. Skadden also provided a draft non-binding\nterm sheet outlining certain proposed terms for the potential transaction to representatives of Latham, which\nincluded the following key terms: (i) a requirement for AMD to agree to any divestures or limitations on its\npost-closing business in order to obtain the approval of the transaction by antitrust authorities\u037e (ii) a fiduciary\ntermination fee payable by Xilinx to AMD equal to 3% of Xilinx\u2019s equity value in the event of a termination of\nthe merger agreement following a change in recommendation by the Xilinx Board\u037e (iii) a fiduciary termination\nfee payable by AMD to Xilinx equal to 3% of AMD\u2019s equity value in the event of a termination of the merger\nagreement following a change in recommendation by the AMD Board\u037e (iv) a termination fee payable by AMD\nto Xilinx equal to 0.5% of AMD\u2019s equity value in the event AMD\u2019s stockholders did not approve the\ntransaction\u037e and (v) a regulatory termination fee payable by AMD to Xilinx equal to $2.5 billion in the event\nthe merger agreement were terminated as a result of a failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals.\nOn September 26, 2020, Mr. Segers spoke with Dr. Su about the post-closing AMD Board representation of\nXilinx directors and discussed how to move this conversation forward.\nAlso on September 26, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke by video call to discuss certain business topics raised\nby Dr. Su relating to the potential transaction, including better understanding each party\u2019s business\ninternationally.\nOn September 27, 2020, Mr. Peng and Dr. Su spoke again by video call to continue their discussion of certain\nbusiness topics raised by Dr. Su.

In this regard, the\nAMD board of directors noted:\nthat Xilinx\u2019s strengths in FPGA, adaptive SOCs and software platforms are highly complementary\nwith AMD\u2019s CPUs and GPUs\u037e\nAMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s complementary focus on leading-edge process technology and packaging\ntechnologies, and the combined technology strengths of AMD and Xilinx creating\ncomplementary technology leadership in the industry in multi-generation architectures, data\ncenter innovation and software enablement\u037e\nthe manufacturing benefits of applying learnings from AMD\u2019s early adoption and high-volume\nproduction ramp of advanced process nodes across the spectrum of Xilinx\u2019s products\u037e\nthe markets of the combined company by combining Xilinx\u2019s leadership position and established\nrelationships in communications infrastructure, industrial, automotive, aerospace, defense and\nother key verticals with AMD\u2019s existing strengths in PC, gaming and data centers, expanding\nAMD\u2019s total addressable market to $110 billion, based on internal management estimates derived\nfrom publicly available information about both companies and the markets in which they operate,\nas well as AMD\u2019s industry experience\u037e\nthat the combined company will have greater research and development resources, engineering\nexpertise and technology, which will allow AMD to better serve customers and accelerate\ninnovation\u037e\nthat the combined company\u2019s complementary product offerings and engineering and technical\nstrengths will be aligned with important secular growth trends, such as cloud computing,\nartificial intelligence, big data analytics, smart networking and software-defined infrastructure\u037e\nthat the combination of AMD\u2019s CPU and GPU compute engines with Xilinx\u2019s flexible accelerators,\nSmartNIC products, software stacks and domain expertise would enable the combined company\nto offer solutions to customers in the telecom, edge, industrial and networking markets that\nunlock additional levels of performance on critical workloads\u037e\nthat the cultures of AMD and Xilinx are strongly aligned, including shared values and\ncommitment to innovation, execution and customer collaboration, and that this culture, along\nwith AMD\u2019s commitment to excellence, will accelerate high performance and adaptive computing\nvisions of the combined company and create a premier growth franchise\u037e\nthe expectation that the combined company will have increased financial strength and flexibility,\nwith an estimated $11.6 billion in combined revenue in the twelve month period prior to signing\u037e\nthat the merger would immediately diversify AMD\u2019s revenue streams and be accretive to AMD\u2019s\nmargins, cash flow and earnings per share, without taking into account expected synergies\u037e\nthe expectation that the merger will create synergies of approximately $300 million within 18\nmonths subsequent to closing, driven primarily by lower operating expenses and cost of goods\nsold\u037e and\nthe expectation that the combined company will be well-capitalized with a stronger balance sheet\nand an investment grade profile.\nExchange Ratio and Merger Consideration. The AMD board of directors considered the relative\nfavorability of the exchange ratio relative to the exchange ratios historically implied by the relative\ntrading prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock over various periods and relative to the current\nassessment of the valuation of each company and of the synergies and other benefits of the merger,\nin addition to:\nthe fact that, upon completion of the merger, AMD stockholders and former Xilinx stockholders\n90 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwill own approximately 74% and 26%, respectively, of the combined company (based on fully\ndiluted shares outstanding of the combined company)\u037e\nthe oral opinion of DBO, rendered to the AMD board of directors, subsequently confirmed in a\nwritten opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2020, and subject to\nthe procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review\nundertaken and other matters considered by DBO in connection with the preparation of its\nopinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of\nview, to AMD (which opinion is more fully described below under \u201c-Opinions of AMD\u2019s\nFinancial Advisors-\u200bOpinion of DBO\u201d and is attached as Annex B hereto)\u037e and\nthe oral opinion of Credit Suisse, rendered to the AMD board of directors, subsequently\nconfirmed in a written opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of October 26, 2020,\nand subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the\nreview undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the\npreparation of its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to AMD (which opinion is more fully described below under \u201c-Opinions\nof AMD\u2019s Financial Advisors-Opinion of Credit Suisse\u201d and is attached as Annex C hereto).\nOther Factors Considered by the AMD Board of Directors. In addition to considering the factors\ndescribed above, the AMD board of directors considered the following additional factors that\nweighed in favor of the merger:\nhistorical information concerning AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s respective businesses, financial condition,\nresults of operations, earnings, trading prices, technology positions, managements, competitive\npositions and prospects on stand-alone and forecasted combined bases\u037e and\nthe current and prospective business environment in which AMD and Xilinx operate, including\ninternational, national and local economic conditions and the competitive and regulatory\nenvironment, and the likely effect of these factors on AMD and the combined company.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The AMD board of directors considered that the terms of the merger\nagreement, taken as a whole, including the parties\u2019 representations, warranties and covenants, and\nthe circumstances under which the merger agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are reasonable.\nThe AMD board of directors also reviewed and considered the conditions to the completion of the\nmerger, and concluded that while the completion of the merger is subject to various regulatory\napprovals, such approvals were likely to be satisfied on a timely basis.\nThe AMD board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of potentially\nnegative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the merger, including:\nthe risk that, because the exchange ratio under the merger agreement would not be adjusted for\nchanges in the market price of AMD or Xilinx common stock, the then-current trading price of the\nshares of AMD common stock to be issued to holders of shares of Xilinx common stock upon the\nconsummation of the merger could be significantly higher than the trading price prevailing at the time\nthe merger agreement was entered into\u037e\nthe fact that each of the opinions of DBO and Credit Suisse as to the fairness, from a financial point\nof view, of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement speaks only as of the date of such\nopinion and did not and will not take into account events occurring or information that has become\navailable after such date, including any changes in the operations and prospects of AMD or Xilinx,\ngeneral economic, monetary, market and other conditions and other factors that may be beyond the\ncontrol of AMD and Xilinx and on which the fairness opinions were based, any of which may be\nmaterial\u037e\nthe risk that Xilinx\u2019s financial performance may not meet AMD\u2019s expectations\u037e\nthe risk that the merger may not be completed or may be delayed despite the parties\u2019 efforts, including\n91 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe possibility that conditions to the

In connection with such review, the Xilinx board of directors also \nconsidered the following specific aspects of the merger agreement (which are not necessarily\npresented in order of relative

With respect to the financial projections,\nDBO was advised by AMD management, and DBO assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared in\ngood faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of\nAMD and Xilinx of the future financial performance of AMD and Xilinx, respectively. DBO expressed no view\nor opinion with respect to the respective financial projections of AMD or Xilinx or the assumptions on which\nthey were made. DBO relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of\nAMD and Xilinx of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the merger\u037e (ii) the\ntiming and risks associated with the integration of AMD and Xilinx\u037e (iii) the ability to retain key employees of\nAMD and Xilinx, respectively\u037e and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s existing\nand future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models.\u200b\nIn addition, DBO assumed that the merger agreement would be substantially similar to the last draft it\nreviewed and that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger\nagreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including that the merger will\nbe treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Code. DBO also assumed that in connection with the\nreceipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the merger,\nno delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on\nAMD, Xilinx or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the merger. DBO is not a legal, tax,\nregulatory or actuarial advisor. DBO is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent\nverification, the assessment of AMD and Xilinx and its legal, tax, regulatory or\n99 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nactuarial advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory or actuarial matters and assumed the correctness in all\nrespects material to its analysis of all legal, tax, regulatory or actuarial advice given to AMD and the AMD\nboard of directors, including, without limitation, advice as to the legal, accounting and tax consequences of\nthe terms of, and transactions contemplated by, the merger agreement to AMD, the AMD stockholders or any\nother person.\nDBO\u2019s opinion was addressed to the AMD board of directors in its consideration of the merger, and its\nopinion does not address the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as\ncompared to any alternative transaction or opportunity that might be available to AMD, nor does it address\nthe underlying business decision by AMD to engage in the merger or the terms of the merger agreement or the\ndocuments referred to therein. DBO\u2019s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any AMD\nstockholder or any other person should vote on or act with respect to the merger or any matter related thereto.\nDBO\u2019s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to AMD, as of October 26, 2020, of\nthe exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement.

DBO expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of\nthe compensation to any Xilinx officer, director or employee, or any class of such persons, in each case in\ntheir capacity as such. Furthermore, DBO was not asked to address, and its opinion does not address, the\nfairness to, or any other consideration to be paid to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of AMD or Xilinx. DBO did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or\nliabilities, nor did DBO receive any such valuation or appraisals, of AMD or Xilinx. DBO\u2019s opinion was\nnecessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to DBO, as of October 26, 2020.

Based on its\nanalysis, DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest\nwhole dollar, as follows:\nSelected Multiple\nImplied Equity Value Per\nShare of \nXilinx Common Stock \nReference Range\nAV/ EBITDA: 22.5x\u202f-\u202f27.5x\n$118 to $143\nP/E: 30.0x\u202f-\u202f37.5x\n$126 to $158\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis of Xilinx\nDBO performed a discounted equity analysis of Xilinx. In performing this analysis, DBO calculated the\nestimated value per share of Xilinx common stock as-of-the-end-of 2023 and as-of-the-end-of 2024,\nrespectively, by applying a NTM P/E multiple reference range of 25.0x to 32.5x to Xilinx\u2019s estimated next-\ntwelve-months earnings per share as of the end of the respective periods, in each case as reflected in the\nAMD adjusted Xilinx\n104 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprojections, and taking into account an annual dividend of $1.52 per share of common stock based on a run-\nrate quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share of common stock determined by DBO based on Xilinx\u2019s current\nquarterly dividend. DBO derived the multiples based on certain comparable public companies and historical\ntrading multiples determined by DBO based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial\nadvisor. The as-of-the-end-of 2023 and 2024 per share values were then discounted to present value using\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO\u2019s\nanalysis of Xilinx\u2019s cost of equity, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of Xilinx\nand the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk\npremium based on academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis,\nDBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest whole\ndollar, of $121 to $165 per share based on the end of 2023 analysis, and of $125 to $173 per share based on the\nend of 2024 analysis.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis of Xilinx\nDBO performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Xilinx by calculating the estimated present value of the\nunlevered free cash flows (see \u201c-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d) of Xilinx reflected in the AMD\nadjusted Xilinx projections for Q4 2020 and the years from 2021 through 2024 and terminal value at the end of\nthat period based on an exit multiple range of 25.0x to 32.5x applied to Xilinx\u2019s estimated next-twelve-months\nearnings as of the end of that period based on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and adjusted for the net\nimpact of interest. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense.\nDBO derived the exit multiples based on certain comparable public companies and historical trading multiples,\ndetermined by DBO, based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The\nunlevered free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates\nranging from 7.5% to 9.5%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO\u2019s analysis of Xilinx\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of Xilinx\nand the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk\npremium based on academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis,\nDBO calculated a range of implied values per share of Xilinx common stock, rounded to the nearest whole\ndollar, of $128 to $173 per share.\nStand-Alone AMD Financial Analysis\nSelected Comparable Public Company Analysis\nDBO reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for AMD to corresponding\nfinancial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies in the processors and networking,\nanalog and communications sectors that DBO deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional\njudgment, to AMD, which selected publicly traded companies are referred to as the \u201cselected comparable\ncompanies\u201d and which information is shown below:\nCompany\n2021\nAV/EBITDA\n2021 P/E\nNVIDIA Corporation\n39.9x\n50.2x\nIntel Corporation\n6.8x\n10.3x\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\n25.0x\n30.7x\nTexas Instruments Incorporated\n19.8x\n25.4x\nAnalog Devices, Inc.\n18.2x\n21.6x\nBroadcom Inc.\n13.6x\n14.6x\nQualcomm, Inc.\n13.7x\n19.1x\nAlthough none of the selected comparable companies is directly comparable to AMD, these companies were\nselected by DBO, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies in the processors and\nnetworking, analog and communications sectors with certain operational and financial characteristics, which,\nfor purposes of its analyses, DBO considered to be similar to those of AMD.

In\nselecting these reference ranges, DBO made qualitative judgments based on its experience and professional\njudgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects\nof AMD and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values in order to provide\na context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying these reference ranges to\nAMD\u2019s 2021 fiscal year estimated adjusted EBITDA and AMD\u2019s 2021 fiscal year estimated adjusted earnings\nper share, in each case, based on the AMD projections, DBO calculated the following implied ranges of values\nper share, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of AMD common stock:\nSelected Multiple\nImplied Equity Value Per\nShare of \nAMD Common Stock \nReference Range\n2021E AV/EBITDA: 30.0x\u202f-\u202f45.0x\n$66 to $98\n2021E P/E: 45.0x\u202f-\u202f60.0x\n$70 to $94\n106 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis of AMD\nDBO performed a discounted equity analysis of AMD by calculating the estimated per share value of AMD\ncommon stock. In performing this analysis, DBO calculated the estimated value per share of AMD common\nstock as of the end of 2023 and as of the end of 2024, respectively, by applying a NTM P/E multiple reference\nrange of 30.0x to 37.5x to AMD\u2019s estimated next-twelve-months earnings per share as of the end of 2023 and a\nNTM P/E multiple range of 27.5x to 35.0x to AMD\u2019s estimated next-twelve-months earnings per share as of the\nend of 2024, in each case as reflected in the AMD projections. DBO derived the multiples based on certain\ncomparable public companies and historical trading multiples determined by DBO based on its experience in\nthe industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The per share values as-of-the-end-of 2023 and 2024 were\nthen discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.5%. This range of discount\nrates was determined based on DBO\u2019s analysis of AMD\u2019s cost of equity, which was informed by the historical\nand projected systematic risk of AMD and the comparable companies as compared to the market as a whole,\nthe risk-free rate and market risk premium based on academic and industry research, and company operating\nmetrics. Based on its analysis, DBO calculated a range of implied values per share of AMD common stock,\nrounded to the nearest whole dollar, of $74 to $98 per share, based on the end of 2023 analysis and of $70 to\n$97 per share based on the end of 2024 analysis.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis of AMD\nDBO performed a discounted cash flow analysis of AMD by calculating the estimated present value of the\nunlevered free cash flows (see \u201c-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d) of AMD reflected in the AMD\nprojections for Q4 2020 and the years from 2021 through 2024 and terminal value at the end of that period\nbased on an exit multiple range of 27.5x to 35.0x applied to AMD\u2019s estimated next-twelve-months earnings as\nof the end of the period based on the AMD projections and adjusted for the net impact of interest, which for\n2024 and 2025 were extrapolated by AMD management. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based\ncompensation was treated as a cash expense with regards to AMD\u2019s projected unlevered free cash flows. DBO\nderived the exit multiples based on comparable public companies and historical trading multiples, determined\nby DBO based on its experience in the industry and judgment as a financial advisor. The unlevered free cash\nflows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to\n10.5%. This range of discount rates was determined based on DBO\u2019s analysis of AMD\u2019s weighted average\ncost of capital, which was informed by the historical and projected systematic risk of AMD and the\ncomparable companies as compared to the market as a whole, the risk-free rate and market risk premium based\non academic and industry research, and company operating metrics. Based on its analysis, DBO calculated a\nrange of implied values per share of AMD common stock, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of $79 to $106\nper share.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis of Synergies (Standalone)\nDBO also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the estimated synergies expected by AMD\nmanagement to be realized in connection with the merger (see \u201c-Certain Estimated Synergies\u201d). In performing\nthis analysis, DBO calculated the estimated present value of the expected annual after tax synergies, net of the\ncosts to achieve such synergies, referred to as \u201cnet synergies,\u201d estimated for the period from 2020 through\n2025, and based on the assumption that the merger is consummated in the fourth quarter of AMD\u2019s 2021 fiscal\nyear, all as provided to DBO by AMD management. The terminal value of the net synergies at the end of 2024\nwas estimated by using perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% and the 2025 estimates. The range\nof perpetuity growth rates was estimated by DBO utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking\ninto account the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and market expectations regarding\nlongterm real growth of gross domestic product and inflation and trends in the industries and sectors in which\nAMD and Xilinx operate. The net synergies and terminal values were then discounted to present value using\ndiscount rates ranging from 7.5% to 10.5%, which range was selected based on DBO\u2019s experience in the\nindustry and judgment as a financial advisor to reflect an estimate of the cost of capital of the combined\ncompany following consummation of the merger and reflecting the minimum and maximum discount rates used\nin the discounted cash flow analyses of Xilinx and AMD, to derive a range of illustrative present values of the\nexpected net\n107 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsynergies. DBO then divided the range of illustrative present values it derived by the number of fully-diluted\noutstanding shares of Xilinx common stock, as provided by the management of Xilinx, to calculate a range of\nimplied values per share of Xilinx common stock of the expected net synergies and rounded to the nearest\nwhole dollar, of $10 to $26 per share.\nExchange Ratio Analysis\nComparable Companies, Discounted Equity Value, Discounted Cash Flow and Selected Transactions-Large\nSemiconductor Analyses\nBased upon a comparison of the range of implied equity values per share for each of Xilinx and AMD\ncalculated pursuant to the selected comparable public companies analyses (including the historical trading\nanalyses), discounted equity value analyses and discounted cash flow analyses described above, DBO\ncalculated ranges of implied exchange ratios for the merger. DBO also calculated a range of implied exchange\nratios for the merger based on the discounted cash flow analyses described above, inclusive of expected\nsynergies resulting from the merger, by adding the implied value per share of Xilinx common stock of the net\nsynergies calculated as described above under \u201c-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis of Synergies (Standalone).\u201d\nDBO also calculated ranges of implied exchange ratios for the merger by comparing the range of low to high\nimplied equity values per share for Xilinx common stock calculated pursuant to the selected large\nsemiconductor transactions described above under \u201c-Stand-Alone Xilinx Financial Analysis-Selected\nTransactions Large Semiconductor Analysis\u201d based both on 1-Day and 30-Days average premiums paid and\nimplied multiples (both AV/EBITDA and P/E) \nand the range of low to high implied equity values per share for the AMD common stock calculated pursuant\nto discounted cash flow analysis of AMD, on a stand-alone basis and without synergies, described above\nunder \u201c-Stand-Alone AMD Financial Analysis-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.\u201d\u200b\nWith respect to any given range of exchange ratios, the higher ratio assumes the highest implied value per\nshare of Xilinx common stock divided by the lowest implied value per share of AMD common stock, and the\nlower ratio assumes the lowest implied value per share of Xilinx common stock divided by the highest implied\nvalue per share of AMD common stock. DBO\u2019s analysis indicated the following implied ranges of exchange\nratios, which it compared to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of 1.7234 shares of AMD\ncommon stock per share of Xilinx common stock.\nValuation Methodology\nImplied Exchange\nRatio \nReference Range\nComparable Companies\nAV/2021 EBITDA\n0.9879x to 1.7854x\n2021 P/E\n0.8924x to 1.6658x\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\n2023\n1.2333x to 2.2330x\n2024\n1.2878x to 2.4573x\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nWithout Synergies\n1.2119x to 2.1965x\nWith Synergies\n1.3067x to 2.5244x\nSelected Transactions\nLarge Semiconductor\u202f-\u202fPremiums\n1.2224x to 2.0834x\nLarge Semiconductor\u202f-\u202fMultiples\n1.1134x to 2.0017x\nSelected Transactions-Large Stock Transactions Premiums Analysis\nUsing data obtained from S&P Capital IQ as of October 23, 2020, DBO analyzed the exchange ratio premiums\npaid in transactions since January 2015 involving (i) the acquisition of targets with disclosed transaction\nvalues greater than $5 billion per S&P Capital IQ, (ii) 100% stock consideration and (iii) 35% or less pro forma\nownership of target stockholders in the combined entity, excluding transactions with a target company in the\nenergy, real estate, financial or utilities sectors and certain transactions due to involvement of related\n108 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nparties or offer structures, which are collectively referred to as the \u201cSelected Transactions-Large Stock\nAcquisitions\u201d).

DBO calculated historical average exchange ratios for these periods by first dividing the closing\nprice per share of Xilinx common stock on each trading day during the period by the closing price per share of\nAMD common stock on the same trading day, and subsequently taking the average of these daily historical\nexchange ratios over such periods, which we refer to as the historical Xilinx/AMD exchange ratio for such\nperiod. DBO then calculated the premiums implied by the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of\n1.7234 shares of AMD common stock per share of Xilinx common stock compared to the historical Xilinx/AMD\nexchange ratio for such periods.\u200b\nThe following table presents the results of these analyses:\nSelected Transactions-Large Stock Acquisitions Premiums\nXilinx/AMD\nHistorical \nPeriod\nLow\n25th \nPercentile\nMedian\nMean\n75th \nPercentile\nHigh\nHistorical\nExchange\nRatio\nImplied\nExchange \nRatio \nReference\nRange\n10-Day\n10\n17\n25\n25\n29\n48\n1.2525x\n1.4611x\u202f-\u202f\n1.6146x\n30-Day\n1\n1\n16\n27\n27\n32\n46\n1.2589x\n1.4644x\u202f-\u202f\n1.6580x\n60-Day\n13\n15\n26\n28\n39\n43\n1.3337x\n1.5306x\u202f-\u202f\n1.8530x\n6 Months\n3\n22\n26\n27\n37\n44\n1.5223x\n1.8593x\u202f-\u202f\n2.0785x\n12 Months\n(2\n12\n23\n24\n40\n42\n1.8372x\n2.0634x\u202f-\u202f\n2.5644x\nDBO then applied the 25th percentile premiums and 75th percentile premiums of the precedent Selected\nTransactions-Large Stock Acquisitions for these periods to the historical Xilinx/AMD exchange ratio for the\ncorresponding period to derive a range of implied exchange ratios for the merger, and compared these implied\nexchange ratios, which are set forth in the following table, to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger\nagreement of 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock per share of Xilinx common stock.\nDBO also observed that applying the low and high premiums derived from the precedent Selected\nTransactions-Large Stock Acquisitions for various periods to the historical Xilinx/AMD exchange ratio for the\ncorresponding period, resulted in the following implied exchange ratio reference ranges: 1.3798x to 1.8544x for\n109 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n)%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe ten-trading day period\u037e 1.4013x to 1.8401x for the 30-trading day period\u037e 1.5039x to 1.9083x for the 60-\ntrading day period\u037e 1.5719x to 2.1873x for the six-month period\u037e and 1.8021x to 2.6048x for the 12-month period.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the merger by the AMD board of directors, DBO performed a variety of\nfinancial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial\nopinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, DBO considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any\nparticular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. DBO believes that selecting any portion of its\nanalyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process\nunderlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, DBO may have given various analyses and factors more or\nless weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable\nthan other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described\nabove should not be taken to be DBO\u2019s view of the actual value of AMD or Xilinx. In performing its analyses,\nDBO made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of AMD\nor Xilinx. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s business and\nthe industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial\ncondition and prospects of AMD and Xilinx and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any\nestimates contained in DBO\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nDBO conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement to AMD and in connection with the\ndelivery of its opinion, dated October 26, 2020, to the AMD board of directors. These analyses do not purport\nto be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of AMD\u2019s or Xilinx\u2019s common stock might actually\ntrade.\u200b\nThe exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was determined through arms-length negotiations\nbetween AMD and Xilinx and was unanimously approved by the AMD board of directors. DBO provided\nadvice to the AMD board of directors during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any\nspecific exchange ratio or amount of consideration to AMD or the AMD board of directors, nor did DBO opine\nthat any specific exchange ratio or amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio or\namount of consideration for the merger. DBO\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as\ncompared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such\nalternatives could be achieved or are available.\nDBO\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute any opinion or recommendation as to how AMD\nstockholders or any other person should vote or act with respect to the merger or any other matter. DBO\u2019s\nopinion and its presentation to the AMD board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration\nby the AMD board of directors in deciding to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nopinion of the AMD board of directors with respect to the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement or\nof whether the AMD board of directors would have been willing to agree to different exchange ratio or amount\nof consideration. DBO\u2019s opinion was approved by DBO\u2019s opinion committee in accordance with DBO\u2019s\ncustomary practice.\u200b\nAMD retained DBO based upon DBO\u2019s qualifications, experience in similar transactions and familiarity with\nAMD and AMD\u2019s industry. DBO provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of persons\nand entities from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. DBO, its affiliates, directors, members,\n110 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nmanagers, officers and employees may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise\nstructure and effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of AMD, Xilinx, or any other company\nthat may be involved in the merger. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, DBO has provided\nadvisory services to AMD and its affiliates for which it received aggregate fees of approximately $400,000. In\nthe two years preceding the date of its opinion, DBO has not had a material relationship with Xilinx or any of\nits affiliates and has not received any fees from Xilinx or any of its affiliates. DBO and its affiliates may in the\nfuture provide investment banking services to Xilinx, AMD or entities that are affiliated with Xilinx or AMD\nand may receive fees for the rendering of such services.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, DBO provided AMD financial advisory services and a financial\nopinion, described in this section and attached as Annex B hereto, in connection with the merger, and AMD\nhas agreed to pay DBO a fee of approximately $27.0 million for its services, approximately $24.3 million of\nwhich is payable contingent upon the closing of the merger, including a portion of which may be paid in the\nform of AMD common stock. In addition to the fee described above, at AMD\u2019s sole discretion, an additional\npayment of up to $10.0 million may be made at closing. AMD has also agreed to reimburse DBO for its\nreasonable expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in\nconnection with its engagement. In addition, AMD has agreed to indemnify DBO and its affiliates, its and their\nrespective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling DBO or any of\nits affiliates from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities related to, arising out of or in\nconnection with DBO\u2019s engagement.\nOpinion of Credit Suisse\nOn October 26, 2020, Credit Suisse rendered its oral opinion to the AMD board of directors (which was\nsubsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Credit Suisse\u2019s written opinion dated as of the same date) to\nthe effect that, as of October 26, 2020, and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made,\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered by Credit Suisse in\nconnection with the preparation of its opinion, the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to AMD.\u200b\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion was directed to the AMD board of directors and only addressed the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, to AMD of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement and did not address any other aspect or\nimplication of the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse\u2019s opinion in this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, a copy of which is attached as Annex C hereto and sets\nforth the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other\nmatters considered by Credit Suisse in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Credit Suisse\u2019s\nwritten opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is intended to be, and they do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to any security holder as\nto how such security holder should vote or act with respect to any matter relating to the merger.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse:\nreviewed an execution copy of the merger agreement\u037e\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to AMD and Xilinx\u037e\nreviewed certain other information relating to AMD and Xilinx, including: (i) financial forecasts\nrelating to Xilinx for the 2021 through 2025 fiscal years, prepared by Xilinx management as\nextrapolated through the 2032 fiscal year by Xilinx management\u037e (ii) financial forecasts relating to\nXilinx for the calendar quarter ending December 2020 and the 2020 through 2025 calendar years\nprepared by AMD management (the \u201cAMD adjusted Xilinx projections\u201d)\u037e and (iii) financial forecasts\nrelating to AMD for the fiscal quarter ending December 2020 and the 2020 through 2023 fiscal years\n111 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprepared by AMD management as extrapolated through the 2025 fiscal year by AMD management (as\nextrapolated, the \u201cAMD projections\u201d) (see \u201c-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d and \u201c-Xilinx\nUnaudited Financial Projections\u201d)\u037e\ndiscussed the business and prospects of AMD and Xilinx with each of AMD and Xilinx management,\nand certain of their respective representatives and affiliates\u037e\nreviewed estimates prepared and provided to Credit Suisse by AMD management with respect to the\npotential cost synergies of the merger, including the costs necessary to achieve such cost synergies\n(the \u201cSynergies Estimates\u201d), anticipated by AMD management to result from the merger (see \u201c-Certain\nEstimated Synergies\u201d)\u037e\nconsidered certain financial and stock market data of AMD and Xilinx, and compared that data with\nsimilar data for other companies with publicly traded equity securities in businesses Credit Suisse\ndeemed similar to those of AMD and Xilinx, respectively\u037e\nconsidered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other business combinations\nand other transactions which had been effected\u037e and\nconsidered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial,\neconomic and market criteria which Credit Suisse deemed relevant.\nIn connection with its review, Credit Suisse did not independently verify any of the foregoing information and,\nwith the consent of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed and relied upon such information\nbeing complete and accurate in all respects material to its analyses and opinion. With respect to the AMD\nprojections and the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, Credit Suisse was advised by AMD management, and\nCredit Suisse assumed with the consent of the AMD board of directors, that such forecasts had been\nreasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nAMD management as to the future financial performance of AMD and Xilinx, respectively. With respect to the\nSynergies Estimates, Credit Suisse was advised by AMD management, and Credit Suisse assumed with the\nconsent of the AMD board of directors, that (i) they had been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of AMD management as to the potential cost\nsynergies, including the costs necessary to achieve such cost synergies, anticipated to result from the merger\nand (ii) the Synergies Estimates will be realized in the amounts and at the times indicated thereby. At the\ndirection of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed that the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted\nXilinx projections and the Synergies Estimates are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate AMD, Xilinx and\nthe merger and, at the direction of the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse relied upon the AMD projections,\nthe AMD adjusted Xilinx projections and the Synergies Estimates for purposes of its analyses and opinion.\nCredit Suisse expressed no view or opinion with respect to the AMD projections, the AMD adjusted Xilinx\nprojections or the Synergies Estimates, or the assumptions and methodologies upon which they are based.\u200b\nFor purposes of its analyses and opinion, Credit Suisse was advised and Credit Suisse assumed that the\nmerger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. With the consent of\nthe AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse also assumed that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or\nthird party consents, approvals or agreements in connection with the merger, no modification, delay,\nlimitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on AMD, Xilinx or the\ncontemplated benefits of the merger. In addition, for purposes of its analyses and opinion, with the consent of\nthe AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse assumed that the merger and any related transactions will be\nconsummated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the terms of the\nmerger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement thereof that\nwas material to Credit Suisse\u2019s analyses or opinion. In addition, Credit Suisse was not requested to make, and\nhas not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of\nAMD or Xilinx, nor was Credit Suisse furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. With the consent of\nthe AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse further assumed that the final form of the merger agreement, when\nexecuted by the\n112 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nparties thereto, would conform to the execution copy reviewed by Credit Suisse in all respects material to\nCredit Suisse\u2019s analyses and opinion.\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to AMD of the exchange\nratio set forth in the merger agreement and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger or\nany other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise,\nincluding, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger and the fairness of the amount or nature of, or\nany other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be received or otherwise payable to any\nofficers, directors, employees, security holders or affiliates of any party to the merger, or class of such\npersons, relative to the exchange ratio or otherwise. Furthermore, Credit Suisse did not express any advice or\nopinion regarding matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, intellectual property, tax,\nenvironmental, executive compensation or other similar professional advice. Credit Suisse assumed that AMD\nhad or would obtain such advice or opinions from the appropriate professional sources. The issuance of\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion was approved by Credit Suisse\u2019s authorized internal committee.\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on information made available to Credit Suisse as of the date of\nits opinion and upon financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated\non the date of its opinion. As the AMD board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets\nhad been experiencing unusual volatility and Credit Suisse expressed no opinion or view as to any potential\neffects of such volatility on AMD, Xilinx or the merger. Credit Suisse did not undertake, and is under no\nobligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events\noccurring or coming to Credit Suisse\u2019s attention after the date of its opinion. Credit Suisse\u2019s opinion did not\naddress the relative merits of the merger as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might have\nbeen available to AMD, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the AMD board of directors or\nAMD to proceed with or effect the merger. Credit Suisse did not express any opinion as to what the value of\nshares of AMD common stock actually would be when issued pursuant to the merger or the price or range of\nprices at which AMD or Xilinx common stock may be purchased, sold or otherwise transferred at any time.\u200b\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion and analyses were for the information of the AMD board of directors (in its capacity\nas such) in connection with its consideration of the merger and were among many factors considered by the\nAMD board of directors in evaluating the merger. Credit Suisse\u2019s opinion did not constitute advice or a\nrecommendation to the AMD board of directors with respect to the merger or advice or any recommendation\nto any security holder as to how such holder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger. Neither\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the exchange ratio or of the views of the AMD\nboard of directors with respect to the merger.\nIn preparing its opinion to the AMD board of directors, Credit Suisse performed a variety of analyses,\nincluding those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse\u2019s financial analyses is not a complete\ndescription of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse\u2019s opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a\ncomplex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to\nthe financial, comparative and other analytic methods employed and the adaptation and application of those\nmethods to the unique facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Credit Suisse\u2019s opinion\nnor the analyses underlying its opinion are readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.\nCredit Suisse arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a\nwhole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic\nmethod or factor. Accordingly, Credit Suisse believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that\nselecting portions of its analyses, analytic methods and factors, without considering all analyses and factors\nor the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying its analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its analyses, Credit Suisse considered business, economic, industry and market conditions,\nfinancial and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its\nopinion. No company, business or transaction used in Credit Suisse\u2019s analyses for comparative purposes is\nidentical to\n113 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAMD, Xilinx or the merger. While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall\nconclusion with respect to fairness, Credit Suisse did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding\nindividual analyses. The implied valuation reference ranges indicated by Credit Suisse\u2019s analyses are\nillustrative and not necessarily indicative of actual values nor predictive of future results or values, which may\nbe significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses\nrelating to the value of assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices\nat which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of AMD and Credit Suisse. Much of the information used in, and accordingly\nthe results of, Credit Suisse\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed in connection with the preparation of\nCredit Suisse\u2019s opinion rendered to the AMD board of directors on October 26, 2020. The analyses\nsummarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a\ncomplete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions,\nqualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit\nSuisse\u2019s analyses.\nFor purposes of its analyses, Credit Suisse reviewed a number of financial metrics including:\nEnterprise Value-generally the value, as of a specified date, of the relevant company\u2019s outstanding\nequity securities (taking into account its options and other outstanding dilutive securities) plus the\nvalue as of such date of its net debt (the value of its outstanding indebtedness, preferred stock and\ncapital lease obligations less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet) and non-\ncontrolling interests, less the value as of such date of its equity method investments (as applicable)\u037e\nAdjusted EBITDA-generally the amount, for a specified time period, of the relevant company\u2019s\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude, as applicable, the\nimpact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating\nitems\u037e and\nAdjusted EPS-generally the amount, for a specified time period, of the relevant company\u2019s earnings\nper weighted average shares outstanding (taking into account its options and other outstanding\ndilutive securities), adjusted to exclude, as applicable, the impact of stock-based compensation\nexpense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items.\nFinancial Analyses Regarding Xilinx\nSelected Companies Analysis Regarding Xilinx\nCredit Suisse considered certain financial data for Xilinx and selected companies with publicly traded equity\nsecurities Credit Suisse deemed relevant. The selected companies were selected because they were deemed to\nbe similar to Xilinx in one or more respects (based on Credit Suisse\u2019s experience and professional judgment).\nNone of the selected companies identified as meeting Credit Suisse\u2019s selection criteria were excluded from the\nanalysis. Stock prices for the selected companies used in the selected companies analysis described below\nwere as of October 23, 2020. The estimates of Xilinx\u2019s future financial performance for the year ending\nDecember 2021 used in the selected companies analysis described below were based on the AMD adjusted\nXilinx projections. Estimates of the future financial performance of the selected companies listed below for the\nyear ending December 2021 were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.\nThe financial data reviewed consisted of:\nEnterprise Value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 2021\n(\u201cEnterprise Value / CY 2021E Adj.

The selected companies\nanalysis indicated an implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $92.72 to\n$120.38.\nSelected Transactions Analysis Regarding Xilinx\nCredit Suisse also considered the financial terms of certain business combinations and other transactions\nCredit Suisse deemed relevant since 2015. The selected transactions were selected because the target\ncompanies were deemed to be similar to Xilinx in one or more respects (based on Credit Suisse\u2019s experience\nand professional judgment). Financial data for the selected transactions were based on public filings, publicly\navailable research analysts\u2019 estimates and other publicly available information. Financial data for Xilinx was\nbased on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections.\nThe financial data for the selected transactions reviewed by Credit Suisse consisted of Enterprise Value\nimplied by the consideration proposed or paid in the selected transactions, as a multiple of the target\ncompanies\u2019 estimated next twelve months Adjusted EBITDA as of the date of announcement of the\ntransaction (\u201cNTM Adj.

The selected transactions\nanalysis indicated an implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $130.47 to\n$155.69.\n115 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx\nCredit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Xilinx by calculating the\nestimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered free cash flows of Xilinx, treating stock-based\ncompensation as a cash expense, based on the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections. Credit Suisse applied, based\non its experience and professional judgment, a range of terminal value multiples of 17.0x to 22.0x to the Xilinx\nNTM Adjusted EBITDA estimate for the year ending December 2025 and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to\n9.5% derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated\nan implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $121.52 to $163.26.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx Including Synergies Estimates\nCredit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Xilinx, including the impact of\nthe Synergies Estimates, by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered\nfree cash flows impact of the Synergies Estimates based on the Synergies Estimates anticipated by AMD\u2019s\nmanagement to result from the merger. Credit Suisse applied, based on its experience and professional\njudgment, a range of terminal value multiples of 17.0x to 22.0x to the NTM Adjusted EBITDA impact of the\nSynergies Estimates for the year ending December 2025 and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.5% derived\nfrom a weighted average cost of capital calculation. Credit Suisse then summed the estimated net present\nvalues of the Synergies Estimates impact and the corresponding enterprise values of Xilinx implied by the\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding Xilinx. The discounted cash flow analysis including Synergies\nEstimates indicated an implied equity value per share reference range for Xilinx common stock of $137.36 to\n$185.01.\nFinancial Analyses Regarding AMD\nSelected Companies Analysis Regarding AMD\nCredit Suisse considered certain financial data for AMD and selected companies with publicly traded equity\nsecurities Credit Suisse deemed relevant. The selected companies were selected because they were deemed to\nbe similar to AMD in one or more respects (based on Credit Suisse\u2019s experience and professional judgment).\nNone of the selected companies identified as meeting Credit Suisse\u2019s selection criteria were excluded from the\nanalysis. Stock prices for the selected companies used in the selected companies analysis described below\nwere as of October 23, 2020. The estimates of AMD\u2019s future financial performance for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 2021 used in the Selected Companies Analysis described below were based on the AMD\nprojections. Estimates of the future financial performance of the selected companies listed below for the fiscal\nyear ending December 2021 were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.\nThe financial data reviewed included:\nEnterprise Value / CY 2021E Adj.

The Selected Companies Analysis indicated\nan implied equity value per share reference range for AMD common stock of $70.23 to $100.57.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis Regarding AMD\nCredit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to AMD by calculating the\nestimated net present value of the projected after-tax, unlevered free cash flows of AMD, treating stock-based\ncompensation as a cash expense, based on the AMD projections. Credit Suisse applied, based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, a range of terminal value multiples of 22.0x to 27.0x to AMD\u2019s NTM\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 2025 and discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 10.5%\nderived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an\nimplied equity value per share reference range for AMD common stock of $82.48 to $107.02.\nFinancial Analyses Regarding the Merger\nImplied Exchange Ratio Analysis\nCredit Suisse then reviewed the 1.7234x exchange ratio for the consideration provided in the merger and\ncompared it with the ranges of exchange ratios implied by its analyses. For each approach noted below, the\nimplied reference range of exchange ratios was determined by (a) using as the bottom end, the amount\ncalculated by dividing the lower bound of the per share reference range for Xilinx common stock by the upper\nbound of the per share reference range for AMD common stock and (b) using as the top end, the amount\ncalculated by dividing the upper bound of the per share reference range for Xilinx common stock by the lower\nbound of the per \nshare reference range for AMD common stock. This analysis resulted in the following implied exchange ratio\nreference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio of 1.7234x set forth in the merger agreement:\u200b\nMethodology\nImplied Exchange\nRatio \nReference Range\nSelected Companies Analysis\n0.9219x - 1.7142x\nSelected Transactions Analysis*\n1.2972x - 2.2170x\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n1.1355x - 1.9794x\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis incl. Synergies \nEstimates\n1.2835x - 2.2432x\nFor the implied exchange ratio reference range derived by the Selected Transactions Analysis, Credit Suisse\nused the reference range for Xilinx common stock indicated by the Selected Transactions Analysis and the\nreference range for AMD common stock indicated by the Selected Companies Analysis.\nSupplemental Information\nCredit Suisse also noted for the AMD board of directors certain additional information that was not\nconsidered material to Credit Suisse\u2019s financial analyses with respect to its opinion but was referenced for\ninformational purposes, including the following:\nHistorical Trading High and Low Stock Prices. Credit Suisse reviewed the closing stock prices for\neach trading day during the twelve-month period ended October 8, 2020 for AMD and Xilinx common\nstock and noted that the high and low closing prices during such period were $92.18 and $28.38 for\nAMD common stock and $111.87 and $68.98 for Xilinx common stock. The ranges of high and low\nclosing stock prices implied an exchange ratio range of 0.7483x to 3.9419x. Credit Suisse noted that the\nexchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is 1.7234x\u037e\nHistorical Trading Exchange Ratios. Credit Suisse reviewed the exchange ratios implied by the\nclosing stock prices for each trading day during the twelve-month period ended October 8, 2020 for\nAMD and\n117 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nXilinx common stock and noted that the high, low, and mean during such period were 3.2703x, 1.1424x,\nand 1.8319x, respectively. Credit Suisse also reviewed the exchange ratios implied by the closing\nstock prices for each trading day during the 5-year period ended October 8, 2020 for AMD and Xilinx\ncommon stock and noted that the high, low, and mean during such period were 26.2732x, 1.1424x, and\n6.3706x, respectively. Credit Suisse noted that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is\n1.7234x\u037e and\nEquity Research Price Targets. Credit Suisse reviewed the publicly available price targets for AMD\nand Xilinx common stock published by certain equity research analysts prior to October 8, 2020 and\nsince July 28, 2020. Credit Suisse noted that the selected research analysts\u2019 share price targets\nreviewed with the AMD board of directors (i) for AMD ranged from $62.00 to $120.00 per share (with a\nmean of $82.92 and a median of $84.00) and (ii) for Xilinx ranged from $86.00 to $130.00 (with a mean of\n$110.79 and a median of $110.00). The ranges of price targets implied an exchange ratio range of\n0.7167x to 2.0968x. Credit Suisse noted that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is\n1.7234x.\nOther Matters\nAfter discussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor as a\ncomplement to DBO, and considering the magnitude of the potential transaction and the benefits of having an\nadditional perspective throughout the process, AMD retained Credit Suisse as its financial advisor in\nconnection with the merger based on Credit Suisse\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation as an\ninternationally recognized investment banking and financial advisory firm. Credit Suisse is entitled to receive a\ntransaction fee of $18.0 million, approximately $16.2 million of which is payable contingent upon the closing of\nthe merger. In addition to the fee described above, at AMD\u2019s sole discretion, an additional payment of up to\n$10.0 million may be made at the closing of the merger.\nCredit Suisse and its affiliates have in the past provided and currently are providing investment banking and\nother financial advice and services to AMD and its affiliates for which advice and services Credit Suisse and\nits affiliates have received and would expect to receive compensation, including among other things, during\nthe past two years, having been and continuing to be a lender under AMD\u2019s credit facility. Credit Suisse and\nits affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial advice and services to AMD,\nXilinx and their respective affiliates for which advice and services Credit Suisse and its affiliates would expect\nto receive compensation. In the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Credit Suisse has been paid\napproximately $1.5 million in fees for investment banking services from AMD and its subsidiaries in matters\nunrelated to the merger. Credit Suisse is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and\nbrokerage activities as well as providing investment banking and other financial advice and services. In the\nordinary course of business, Credit Suisse and its affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for its and its affiliates\u2019\nown accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments\n(including bank loans and other obligations) of AMD, Xilinx and their respective affiliates, and any other\ncompany that may be involved in the merger, as well as provide investment banking and other financial advice\nand services to such companies and their affiliates.\nOpinion of Xilinx\u2019s Financial Advisors\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley\nAfter considering multiple banks of high quality and reputation who were unlikely to have conflicts with\nrespect to a transaction between Xilinx and AMD as potential financial advisors to the Xilinx Board, and after\ndiscussing each bank\u2019s experience, expertise and qualifications, Xilinx retained Morgan Stanley to act as\nfinancial advisor to the Xilinx board of directors in connection with the proposed merger. The Xilinx board of\ndirectors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexpertise and reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the industry, and its\nknowledge of Xilinx\u2019s business and affairs. At the meeting of the Xilinx board of directors on October 26, 2020,\nMorgan Stanley rendered its\n118 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date, and based upon and subject to the\nvarious assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nscope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the exchange ratio\npursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Xilinx\ncommon stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares).\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of October 26, 2020, which sets forth, among\nother things, the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. You are encouraged to read the entire opinion carefully and\nin its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was rendered for the benefit of the Xilinx board of directors, in its\ncapacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio\npursuant to the merger agreement to the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock (other than holders of the\nExcluded Shares) as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address any other aspect of\nthe merger or related transactions, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other\nalternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the price at which shares of AMD common stock or\nXilinx common stock would trade at any time in the future, or the fairness of the amount or nature of the\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of Xilinx, or any class of such persons, relative to the\nconsideration to be received by the holders of shares of Xilinx common stock pursuant to the merger. The\nopinion was addressed to, and rendered for the benefit of, the Xilinx board of directors and was not intended\nto, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of shares of Xilinx common stock or\nany holder of shares of AMD common stock as to how to vote with respect to the merger.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information\nof Xilinx and AMD, respectively\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Xilinx\nand AMD, respectively\u037e\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of Xilinx and AMD, respectively,\nincluding certain adjustments to the financial projections of AMD and certain extrapolations to those\nof Xilinx and AMD in each case prepared at the direction of Xilinx\u037e\nreviewed and discussed with the management of Xilinx certain publicly available Wall Street research\ncontaining financial projections relating to Xilinx and AMD that are generally reflective of consensus\nestimates\u037e\nreviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from\nthe merger, prepared by the managements of Xilinx and AMD, respectively\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Xilinx,\nincluding information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from\nthe merger, with senior executives of Xilinx\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of AMD,\nincluding information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from\nthe merger, with senior executives of AMD\u037e\nreviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on AMD\u2019s earnings per share, cash flow, consolidated\ncapitalization and certain financial ratios\u037e\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Xilinx common stock and AMD common\nstock\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of Xilinx and AMD and the prices and trading activity of the\nXilinx common stock and the AMD common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded\ncompanies comparable with Xilinx and AMD, respectively, and their securities\u037e\n119 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition\ntransactions\u037e\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Xilinx and AMD and\ntheir financial and legal advisors\u037e\nreviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents\u037e and\nperformed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed\nappropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied, or otherwise made\navailable to Morgan Stanley by Xilinx and AMD, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect\nto the financial projections, as well as certain adjustments to the financial projections of AMD and certain\nextrapolations to those of Xilinx and AMD in each case prepared at the direction of Xilinx and information\nrelating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley\nassumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the respective managements of Xilinx and AMD of the future financial performance of Xilinx\nand AMD. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the\nmanagements of Xilinx and AMD of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the\nmerger\u037e (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of Xilinx and AMD\u037e (iii) their ability to retain\nkey employees of Xilinx and AMD, respectively and (iv) the validity of, and risks associated with, Xilinx and\nAMD\u2019s existing and future technologies, intellectual property, products, services and business models. In\naddition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth\nin the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among\nother things, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Code, and that the\ndefinitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan\nStanley. Morgan \nStanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other\napprovals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will\nbe imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in\nthe proposed merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared\nto any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could\nbe achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a\nfinancial advisor only and at Xilinx\u2019s direction relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment\nof Xilinx and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters (existing,\ncontingent or otherwise). Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or\nnature of the compensation to any of Xilinx\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,\nrelative to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Xilinx common stock in the\ntransaction. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of\nXilinx or AMD, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Morgan Stanley as of, October 26, 2020. Events occurring after October 26, 2020\nmay affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not\nassume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with\nits oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion dated October 26, 2020. The following summary is\nnot a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors\nconsidered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described\nrepresent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion,\nMorgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any\nanalysis described\n120 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbelow. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered, without considering all analyses and\nfactors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nSome of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to\nfully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text\nof each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.\nFurthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful\nmethod of using the data referred to below.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized\nand relied upon certain financial projections provided by Xilinx\u2019s and AMD\u2019s managements, including certain\nadjustments to the financial projections of AMD prepared at the direction of Xilinx, and referred to below. For\nfurther information regarding the financial projections, see \u201c-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d and \u201c-\nAMD Unaudited Financial Projections.\u201d\nRelative Discounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the\npotential future equity value of a company as a function of the company\u2019s estimated future earnings. The\nresulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value for\nsuch company\u2019s potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a\nrange of implied present equity values per share on a stand-alone basis for each of Xilinx and AMD.\nTo calculate the discounted equity value for AMD, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated calendar years 2022 and\n2023 earnings per share based on the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections (as defined below), as well as\nestimated calendar year 2022 earnings per share based on the AMD Street Case (as defined below). To\ncalculate the estimated discounted equity value for Xilinx, Morgan Stanley utilized fiscal years 2023 and 2024\nearnings per share based upon the Xilinx projections (as defined below), as well as estimated fiscal year 2023\nearnings per share based on the Xilinx Street Case (as defined below). Based upon the application of its\nprofessional judgment and experience after reviewing and comparing certain financial estimates for each of\nXilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for the\nselected comparable companies described in \u201c-Relative Public Trading Multiples Analysis,\u201d Morgan Stanley\napplied a range of P/E (as defined below) multiples (based on the range of P/E multiples for the comparable\ncompanies listed in the following section, of 30.0x to 50.0x, in the case of AMD, and 24.0x to 36.0x, in the case\nof Xilinx) to these estimates and applied a discount rate of 9.3%, in the case of AMD, and 6.8%, in the case of\nXilinx, which rates were selected based on each company\u2019s estimated cost of equity, taking into account\nestimated market risk premium risk free rate, betas and other factors.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the high end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the highest per share price for\nXilinx resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above by the lowest per share price for\nAMD resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above. Morgan Stanley calculated the\nlow end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the lowest per share price for Xilinx resulting from the\napplication of the relevant multiples described above by the highest per share price for AMD resulting from\nthe application of the relevant multiples described above. Based on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley calculated\nthe following implied exchange ratio reference range:\nRelative Discounted Equity Value Analysis\nImplied Transaction \nExchange Ratio\nRange\nXilinx Mgmt.

Morgan Stanley reviewed and\ncompared certain financial estimates for each of Xilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that share similar business\ncharacteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, product\ncharacteristics, revenue growth, growth margin, profitability and/or other similar operating characteristics\n(which are referred to as the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These companies were the following:\nAnalog Devices, Inc.\u037e\nBroadcom Inc.\u037e\nInphi Corporation\u037e\nIntel Corporation\u037e\nLattice Semiconductor Corporation\u037e\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\u037e\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\u037e\nNVIDIA Corporation\u037e\nQualcomm, Inc.\u037e and\nTexas Instruments Incorporated.\nIn the case of applying the analysis to Xilinx, AMD was included in the group of comparable companies. In\nthe case of applying the analysis to AMD, Xilinx was included in the group of comparable companies. None of\nthe selected companies identified as meeting Morgan Stanley\u2019s selection criteria were excluded from the\nanalysis.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed (a) the ratio of price to earnings (\u201cP/E\u201d), which\nMorgan Stanley defined as the ratio of price per share to estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to\nas \u201cEPS,\u201d and (b) the ratio of P/E to growth (\u201cP/E/G\u201d), which Morgan Stanley calculated as the P/E divided by\nthe applicable revenue compounded annual growth rate (in each case the estimated revenue compound annual\ngrowth rate from calendar year 2020 to calendar year 2022), of each of these comparable companies based on\npublicly available financial information compiled by Thomson Reuters for comparison purposes. For the\npurposes of this analysis and certain other analyses described below, Morgan Stanley utilized (a) the mean of\nselected Wall Street research estimates for each of AMD and Xilinx available as of October 8, 2020 in the case\nof AMD and as of October 21, 2020 or October 22, 2022 (as applicable) in the case of Xilinx, which is referred\nto below as the \u201cAMD Street Case\u201d and the \u201cXilinx Street Case,\u201d as applicable, (b) financial projections for\nXilinx, prepared by Xilinx and reflecting Xilinx\u2019s LRP (as defined below), which are referred to below as the\n\u201cXilnx projections,\u201d and (c) financial projections for AMD, prepared by AMD, incorporating certain\nadjustments thereto made at the direction of Xilinx, which is referred to below as the \u201cXilinx adjusted AMD\nprojections.\u201d For further information regarding the financial projections, see \u201c-Xilinx Unaudited Financial\nProjections\u201d and \u201c-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections.\u201d\n122 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following tables represent the P/E and P/E/G multiples from such comparable companies for each of AMD\nand Xilinx:\nXilinx - Representative P/E and P/E/G multiples \nfrom comparable companies\nMedian of Multiples\nP/E (CY21)\n25.8x\nP/E (CY22)\n25.1x\nP/E/G (CY21)\n3.1x\nP/E/G (CY22)\n2.8x\nAMD - Representative P/E and P/E/G multiples \nfrom comparable companies\nMedian of Multiples\nP/E (CY21)\n24.2x\nP/E (CY22)\n21.8x\nP/E/G (CY21)\n2.7x\nP/E/G (CY22)\n2.5x\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application\nof its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of price to\nearnings multiples and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for each of Xilinx and\nAMD, as applicable. The following representative ranges of P/E and P/E/G multiples were used:\nRepresentative P/E and P/E/G multiples \n(based on peer multiples that include stock-based compensation as an\nexpense)\nRange of Multiples\nP/E - Xilinx (CY21)\n24.0x\u202f-\u202f36.0x\nP/E - Xilinx (CY22)\n20.0x\u202f-\u202f32.0x\nP/E/G - Xilinx (CY21)\n2.50x\u202f-\u202f3.75x\nP/E/G - Xilinx (CY22)\n2.00x\u202f-\u202f3.25x\nRepresentative P/E and P/E/G multiples \n(based on peer multiples that exclude stock-based compensation as an\nexpense)\nRange of Multiples\nP/E - AMD (CY21)\n30.0x\u202f-\u202f50.0x\nP/E - AMD (CY22)\n26.0x\u202f-\u202f46.0x\nP/E/G - AMD (CY21)\n2.50x\u202f-\u202f3.75x\nP/E/G - AMD (CY22)\n2.00x\u202f-\u202f3.25x\n123 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, including equity awards (using the treasury method),\nas provided by AMD on October 20, 2020 and Xilinx on October 20, 2020, as applicable, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the estimated implied exchange ratio range as set forth in the table below. Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the high end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the highest per share price for Xilinx resulting\nfrom the application of the relevant multiples described above by the lowest per share price for AMD resulting\nfrom the application of the relevant multiples described above. Morgan Stanley calculated the low end of the\nexchange ratio range by dividing the lowest per share price for Xilinx resulting from the application of the\nrelevant multiples described above by the highest per share price for AMD resulting from the application of\nthe relevant multiples described above.\u200b\nPublic Trading Multiples Analysis\nImplied Transaction \nExchange Ratio\nRange\nCY2021E P/E\nXilinx Mgmt.

In\nevaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many\nof which are beyond the control of Xilinx, AMD or Morgan Stanley. These include, among other things, the\nimpact of competition on Xilinx or AMD\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Xilinx or AMD, and the\nindustry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or\nmedian) is not in and of itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nRelative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of\na company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such\ncompany. Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone unlevered after-tax free\ncash flows that AMD and Xilinx were forecasted to generate during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020\nthrough calendar year 2031, in the case of AMD, and during the second-half of fiscal year 2021 through fiscal\nyear 2032 in the case of Xilinx. For purposes of this analysis, unlevered after-tax free cash flows were\ncalculated using the following metrics: revenue, EBITDA (treating stock-based compensation as an expense),\nEBIT (treating stock-based compensation as an expense), less taxes, adding depreciation, less change in net\nworking capital and less capital expenditures. Financial data used in this analysis was based on the Xilinx\nadjusted AMD projections for the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020 through calendar year 2023 on a\nstandalone basis, in the case of AMD, and the Xilinx projections for Xilinx\u2019s second half of fiscal year 2020\nthrough fiscal year 2025, in the case of Xilinx. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis based on fully diluted\nshare counts as of October 20, 2020 provided by the respective managements of AMD and Xilinx, amounting\nto a total of 252,117,021 shares of Xilinx common stock and 1,235,191,515 shares of AMD common stock.\nBased on the foregoing, Morgan\n124 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStanley calculated the terminal year unlevered after-tax free cash flow for AMD at $10,185 million and for Xilinx\nat $2,509 million.\nMorgan Stanley then estimated the terminal values of both AMD and Xilinx at the end of the forecast period\nby using terminal EBITDA multiples ranging from 11.0x to 15.0x, which multiples were selected upon the\napplication of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, after reviewing and comparing certain\nfinancial estimates for each of Xilinx and AMD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst\nresearch estimates for the selected comparable companies described in \u201c -Relative Public Trading Multiples\nAnalysis.\u201d The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of September 30, 2020\nusing discount rates ranging from 8.3% to 10.3%, in the case of AMD, and 6.8% to 7.8%, in the case of Xilinx,\nwhich discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, to reflect a weighted average cost of capital calculation for AMD and Xilinx, respectively, taking\ninto account estimated market risk premium, risk free rate, betas, pre-tax cost of debt and debt to total\ncapitalization and other factors. The resulting aggregate values were then adjusted for net debt, taking into\naccount a net debt balance of $1,096 million for Xilinx as of September 26, 2020 and $1,459 million for AMD as\nof October 14, 2020.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the high end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the highest per share price for\nXilinx resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above by the lowest per share price for\nAMD resulting from the application of the relevant multiples described above. Morgan Stanley calculated the\nlow end of the exchange ratio range by dividing the lowest per share price for Xilinx resulting from the\napplication of the relevant multiples described above by the highest per share price for AMD resulting from\nthe application of the relevant multiples described above. Based on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley calculated\nthe following implied exchange ratio reference range:\nRelative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nImplied Transaction \nExchange Ratio\nRange\nAs of October 8, 2020\n1.1724x\u202f-\u202f2.2233x\nMorgan Stanley noted that the exchange ratio in the merger is 1.7234x.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial\nanalysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Xilinx board of directors,\nincluding the following information described below under \u201c-Precedent Premia Analysis,\u201d \u201c-Relative Historical\nExchange Ratio\u201d and \u201c-Relative Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets.\u201d\nPrecedent Premia Analysis\nMorgan Stanley reviewed, based on publicly available information, the premiums paid in selected acquisition\ntransactions in the United States.\nMorgan Stanley considered premiums paid in transactions since 2010 in which the consideration was stock\nand which had an equity value of $1.0 billion or more and in which the acquiring company stockholders\nretained ownership of between 20% and 40% in the combined company. The premiums paid in such\ntransactions represented a (i) median and mean of 19.2% with respect to one-day spot exchange ratio\npremiums to unaffected prices and (ii) median of 20.9% and mean of 19.2% with respect to 30-trading day\nexchange ratio premiums to unaffected prices.\n125 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on this analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected reference premium ranges of (i)\n12.6% to 23.8% to apply to Xilinx\u2019s closing stock price on October 8, 2020 and (ii) 13.4% to 26.4% to apply to\nXilinx\u2019s closing stock price for the 30-trading day average ending on October 8, 2020.\nMorgan Stanley then calculated the exchange ratio implied by dividing the reference ranges for a share of\nXilinx common stock derived from the precedent premia analyses by the unaffected closing price for AMD\ncommon stock. The analyses indicated the following implied the following implied exchange ratio ranges:\nExchange Ratio Premia Paid\nImplied Transaction \nExchange Ratio\nRange\n1-day Exchange-Ratio Premium (12.6%-23.8%)\n1.3795x\u202f-\u202f1.5168x\n30-day Avg.

Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily involves complex considerations\nand judgments concerning differences between the merger and the other transactions, Xilinx and AMD and\nother factors. In evaluating the precedent premia transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and\nassumptions with regard to the applicable transactions, size, business mix, governance matters, industry\nperformance, geographic mix, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond the control of Xilinx or AMD. Mathematical analyses (such as determining the mean or median) are\nnot in themselves a meaningful method of using comparable data.\nRelative Historical Exchange Ratio\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the range of the ratio of closing prices of Xilinx common stock divided by the\ncorresponding closing prices of AMD common stock over the 52-week period ended on October 8, 2020 (the\nlast full unaffected trading day prior to the market rumors regarding the transaction).

These forward targets\nreflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of the 12-month future public market trading price of AMD common stock\nand Xilinx common stock.

The preparation of a\nfinancial opinion is a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary\ndescription. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole\nand did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes\nthat selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an\nincomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have\ngiven various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed\nvarious assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations\nresulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of the\nactual value of AMD or Xilinx. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions\nwith regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions\nand other matters, which are beyond the control of AMD or Xilinx. Any estimates contained in Morgan\nStanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly\nmore or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\u200b\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement to the holders of shares of\nXilinx common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its\nopinion, dated October 26, 2020, to the Xilinx board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of AMD common stock or Xilinx common stock might\nactually trade.\nThe exchange ratio was determined by AMD and Xilinx through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between AMD and\nXilinx and approved by the Xilinx board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Xilinx board of\ndirectors during these negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio\nto Xilinx or the Xilinx board of directors or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate\nexchange ratio for the merger.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Xilinx board of directors was one of many factors taken\ninto consideration by the Xilinx board of directors in deciding to approve the merger agreement and approve\nthe transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Consequently, the analyses as described above\nshould not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Xilinx board of directors with respect to the\nexchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Xilinx board of directors would have been\nwilling to agree to a different exchange ratio. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of\nMorgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary\npractice.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any\nholder of shares of Xilinx common stock or AMD common stock as to how to vote or act on any matter with\nrespect to the merger or related transactions or any other action with respect to the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address any other aspect of the merger or related\ntransactions, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business\ntransaction, or other alternatives, the prices at which shares of AMD common stock or Xilinx common stock\nwould trade at any time in the future, or the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any\nofficers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the\nexchange ratio.\n128 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nThe Xilinx board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications,\nexperience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,\ninvestment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in\nsecurities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, and prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory\nservices. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or\nmanage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise\nstructure and effect transactions, for their own account or for the accounts of their customers, in debt or\nequity securities or loans of Xilinx, AMD and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency\nor commodity, that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or any related\nderivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided Xilinx with financial advisory services and\na financial opinion in connection with the merger, described in this section and attached as Annex D hereto,\nand for such services Xilinx has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of $70 million, which is\ncontingent upon the closing of the merger (other than $5 million paid upon public announcement of the\nmerger), and up to an additional $40 million calculated based on the extent to which the value of Xilinx\u2019s\nshares in the merger immediately prior to closing (as measured by the trading price of the AMD common stock\nreceived in the merger) exceeds a specified threshold. Based on the trading price of AMD common stock on\nMarch 4, 2021, the additional fee payable to Morgan Stanley would be approximately $19 million. $5 million of\nthe transaction fee was paid upon the public announcement of the merger, and the remainder is contingent\nupon the closing of the merger. Xilinx has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable\nexpenses, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in\nconnection with its engagement. In addition, Xilinx has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates,\ntheir respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan\nStanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s engagement. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have\nprovided financing services to Xilinx and received aggregate fees of less than $3 million from Xilinx in\nconnection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates have not provided any financial advisory or financing services to AMD, and, accordingly, have not\nreceived fees for such services from AMD during this time. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial\nadvisory and financing services to Xilinx and AMD and their respective affiliates in the future and would\nexpect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nOpinion of BofA Securities\nAfter discussing the advantages and disadvantages of engaging a second financial advisor, given the\nmagnitude of the potential transaction, importance of the investment decision and also because it would be\nhelpful to have a second perspective while going through the process, Xilinx retained BofA Securities to act\nas one of its financial advisors in connection with the merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in\nconnection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and\nunlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Xilinx selected BofA\nSecurities to act as Xilinx\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Securities\u2019\nexperience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity\nwith Xilinx and its business.\nOn October 26, 2020, at a meeting of the Xilinx board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Securities\ndelivered to the Xilinx board of directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion dated October 26, 2020, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and\nsubject to various assumptions and limitations described in its written opinion, the exchange ratio provided\nfor in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Xilinx common stock.\nThe full text of BofA Securities\u2019 written opinion to the Xilinx board of directors, which describes, among other things,\nthe assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review\n129 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nundertaken, is attached as Annex E hereto and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote\nor act in connection with the merger or any related matter.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Xilinx and AMD\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations\nand prospects of Xilinx furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by Xilinx management,\nincluding certain financial projections relating to Xilinx prepared by Xilinx management and certain\nextrapolations thereto prepared by or at the direction of and approved by Xilinx management, which\nare referred to as the \u201cXilinx projections\u201d\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations\nand prospects of AMD furnished to BofA Securities by AMD management, including certain financial\nprojections relating to AMD prepared by AMD management, which are referred to as the \u201cAMD\nprojections\u201d\u037e\nreviewed an alternative version of the AMD forecasts incorporating certain adjustments thereto made\nby Xilinx management and certain extrapolations thereto prepared by or at the direction of and\napproved by Xilinx management, which are referred to as the \u201cXilinx adjusted AMD projections,\u201d and\ndiscussed with Xilinx management its assessments as to the relative likelihood of achieving the future\nfinancial results reflected in the AMD projections and the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections\u037e\nreviewed certain estimates furnished to BofA Securities by Xilinx management as to the amount and\ntiming of cost savings and the costs of achieving such results anticipated by Xilinx and AMD\nmanagements to result from the merger, which are referred to as \u201ccost savings\u201d\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Xilinx with\nmembers of senior management of Xilinx, and discussed the past and current business, operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects of AMD with members of senior management of Xilinx\u037e\nreviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on the future financial performance of\nAMD\u037e\nreviewed the trading histories for Xilinx common stock and AMD common stock and a comparison of\nsuch trading histories with each other and with the trading histories of other companies BofA\nSecurities deemed relevant\u037e\ncompared certain financial and stock market information of Xilinx and AMD with similar information of\nother companies BofA Securities deemed relevant\u037e\ncompared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of\nother transactions BofA Securities deemed relevant\u037e\nreviewed the relative financial contributions of Xilinx and AMD to the future financial performance of\nthe combined company on a pro forma basis\u037e\nreviewed a draft, dated October 25, 2020, of the merger agreement, which is referred to as the \u201cdraft\nagreement\u201d\u037e and\n130 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperformed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as\nBofA Securities deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or\notherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of Xilinx management that they\nwere not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or\nmisleading in any material respect.

BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Xilinx or\nAMD under \nany state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process\ninvolving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and\nthe application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not\nreadily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses\nsummarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of\nits analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific\nanalysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given\ngreater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Xilinx and AMD. The estimates of the\nfuture performance of Xilinx and AMD in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses are not necessarily\nindicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than\nthose estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part\nof BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio and were\nprovided to the Xilinx board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or\nthe prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the\nestimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual\nvalues of Xilinx or AMD.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between\nXilinx and AMD, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Xilinx board of directors. The\n139 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndecision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Xilinx board of directors. As described\nabove, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Xilinx board of\ndirectors in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Xilinx\nboard of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio.\nXilinx has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of $20\nmillion, $4 million of which was payable in connection with its opinion and the remainder of which is\ncontingent upon the completion of the merger. Xilinx also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its\nreasonable expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA\nSecurities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,\nemployees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in\nsecurities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal\ninvesting as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,\nfinancing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of\ncompanies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its\naffiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long\nor short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other\nsecurities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Xilinx, AMD and\ncertain of their respective affiliates.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may\nprovide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Xilinx and have received or in\nthe future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted as joint\nbook running manager for a debt offering of Xilinx, (ii) having acted or acting as lender under certain term\nloans, letters of credit and other credit facilities for Xilinx, (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury\nmanagement services and products to Xilinx and (iv) having provided or providing certain derivatives and\nforeign exchange trading services to Xilinx. From October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020, BofA Securities\nand its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Xilinx of approximately $4 million for investment and\ncorporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the\nfuture may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to AMD and have\nreceived or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having\nacted or acting as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner for, and a lender under, certain term loans, letters of\ncredit and other credit facilities of AMD, (ii) having provided or providing certain treasury management\nservices and products to AMD and (iii) having provided or providing certain derivatives and foreign exchange\ntrading services to AMD. From October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020, BofA Securities and its affiliates\nderived aggregate revenues from AMD of approximately $16 million for investment and corporate banking\nservices.\u200b\nAMD Unaudited Financial Projections\nIn connection with the merger, AMD management prepared certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation of AMD for its 2020 through 2023 fiscal years, which AMD management then extrapolated for\nAMD\u2019s 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. These projections and extrapolations are referred to together as the \u201cAMD\nprojections.\u201d Also in connection with the merger, AMD received certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation concerning Xilinx for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, which AMD management adjusted to\nmoderate the growth rate to reflect the competitive environment and to provide for a December year end.\nThese adjusted projections for the years ending December 2020 through December 2025 are referred to as the\n\u201cAMD adjusted Xilinx projections.\u201d The AMD projections were prepared for internal use only and were\nprovided to the AMD board of directors for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger.\nThe AMD projections were also provided to AMD\u2019s financial advisors, DBO and Credit Suisse, in connection\nwith rendering their respective fairness\n140 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nopinions to the AMD board of directors and in performing the related analyses. The AMD projections for\nAMD\u2019s 2020 through 2023 fiscal years (but not the extrapolations for AMD\u2019s 2024 and 2025 fiscal years) were\nalso provided to Xilinx management in connection with its consideration and evaluation of the merger and to\nXilinx\u2019s financial advisors, Morgan Stanley and BofA Securities. The AMD projections and, to the knowledge\nof AMD, the AMD adjusted Xilinx projections, were prepared treating each of AMD and Xilinx on a stand-\nalone basis, without giving effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger,\nthe expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the potential synergies that\nmay be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect of any business or strategic\ndecision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or\nthe effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger\nagreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in\nanticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, AMD management also independently and\ncollaboratively prepared with Xilinx management certain estimates of annual cost synergies expected to be\nrealized following the closing, which are referred to as the \u201cestimated synergies\u201d and are summarized under \u201c-\nCertain Estimated Synergies.\u201d These estimated synergies are not reflected in the financial projections prepared\nby AMD or by Xilinx.\nAMD historically provides quarterly, annual and long-term financial guidance to investors. Long-term\nforecasts or projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results are subject to risks, due\nto, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future\nperiods and the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the financial projections\nby AMD are being included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to give stockholders access to certain\nnon-public information provided to the AMD board of directors and AMD\u2019s financial advisors and to Xilinx\nand its financial advisors for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion of the financial\nprojections by AMD should not be regarded as an indication that the AMD board of directors, AMD, the\nXilinx board of directors, Xilinx, DBO, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities or any other recipient of\nthis information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an\naccurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.\nThe accompanying financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies were not prepared with a view\ntoward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines established by the\nSEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective\nfinancial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of AMD management, were, or, in the case of the AMD\nadjusted Xilinx projections, assumed to have been, prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best\navailable estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation, to\nthe best of management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future\nfinancial performance of AMD or Xilinx, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be\nrelied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the financial projections by AMD or the\nestimated synergies. Although AMD management believes there is, or, in the case of the AMD adjusted Xilinx\nprojections, assumed there was, a reasonable basis for the financial projections by AMD and the estimated\nsynergies, AMD cautions stockholders that future results could be materially different from the financial\nprojections by AMD and the estimated synergies. This summary of the financial projections by AMD and the\nestimated synergies is not being included in this joint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus to influence any decision\non whether to vote for the AMD share issuance proposal or the Xilinx merger proposal, but rather because the\nfinancial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies were shared between AMD and Xilinx and provided\nto AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s respective boards of directors and financial advisors for purposes of considering and\nevaluating the merger and the merger agreement. AMD\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst\n& Young LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect\nto the financial projections by AMD and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto.\u200b\nThe financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies are subject to estimates and assumptions in\nmany respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the\nfinancial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies are based upon a variety of estimates and\nassumptions that are\n141 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by AMD management, or, in the case of the AMD\nadjusted Xilinx projections, assumed to be reasonable, as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and\nassumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, including general economic conditions,\nindustry capital spending and unit production trends, competition and the risks discussed under \u201cCautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d See also \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d The financial projections by AMD and the estimated synergies also reflect assumptions as to\ncertain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the financial projections by AMD were\ndeveloped for AMD on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to the merger, they do not reflect any\ndivestitures or other restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary\ngovernmental or regulatory approvals, any synergies that may be realized as a result of the merger or any\nchanges to AMD\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after completion of the merger. There can\nbe no assurance that the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies will be realized, and actual\nresults may differ materially from those shown. Generally, the further out the period to which financial\nprojections by AMD and the estimated synergies relate, the less predictable and more unreliable the\ninformation becomes.\nThe financial projections by AMD contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that AMD believes are\nhelpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. AMD management regularly uses a\nvariety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring\nfinancial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for comparable GAAP measures. While AMD believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide\nmeaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze AMD\u2019s financial and\nbusiness trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not\nreported by all of AMD\u2019s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of\nAMD\u2019s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation.\nNeither AMD nor Xilinx has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in these\nprojections to the comparable GAAP measure due to no reasonably accessible or reliable comparable GAAP\nmeasures for these measures and the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the measures that are\nnecessary for such reconciliation.\nNone of AMD, Xilinx, the combined company or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other\nrepresentatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the financial projections by\nAMD or the estimated synergies, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise\nor reconcile, the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies to reflect circumstances existing\nafter the date the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies were generated or to reflect the\noccurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying financial\nprojections by AMD or the estimated synergies, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Except as required by\napplicable laws, AMD does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the financial\nprojections by AMD or the estimated synergies, even in the event that any or all assumptions are shown to be\nin error. None of AMD or its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes\nany representation to any AMD stockholder or other person regarding AMD\u2019s ultimate performance compared\nto the information contained in the financial projections by AMD, the estimated synergies or that forecasted\nresults will be achieved. AMD has made no representation to Xilinx, in the merger agreement or otherwise,\nconcerning the financial projections by AMD or the estimated synergies.\nAMD has not obtained, and does not intend to obtain, updated, revised or reaffirmed opinions from DBO and\nCredit Suisse, and AMD has not updated, revised or reaffirmed, and does not intend to update, revise or\nreaffirm, any of the projections or assumptions that it provided to DBO and Credit Suisse and upon which\nDBO and Credit Suisse based their respective opinions.

See\n\u201c-Opinions of AMD\u2019s Financial Advisors.\u201d Further, the projections that AMD provided to DBO and Credit\nSuisse were not necessarily indicative of the results that AMD will achieve for any period ending after the\ndate of the opinions.\n142 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHowever, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and except as otherwise publicly disclosed,\nAMD is not aware of, and does not anticipate to occur before the AMD special meeting, any material change\nor anticipated material change in its operations or performance, or to the projections or assumptions upon\nwhich DBO and Credit Suisse based their respective opinions, since the date of such opinions.\nSummary of the AMD Projections\nThe following table presents certain unaudited prospective financial information of AMD prepared by AMD\nmanagement for AMD\u2019s 2020 through 2023 fiscal years, and extrapolated by AMD management for AMD\u2019s\n2024 and 2025 fiscal years.\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nFY20E\nFY21E\nFY22E\nFY23E\nFY24E\nFY25E\nRevenue\n$9,319\n$11,500\n$14,000\n$17,000\n$19,550\n$ 22,000\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n1,463\n1,924\n2,706\n3,581\n4,206\n4,831\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n1,841\n2,668\n3,654\n4,760\n5,572\n6,380\nAdjusted EPS\n\u200b\n1.20\n1.56\n2.19\n2.90\n3.41\n3.92\nUnlevered free cash flow\n\u200b\n362\n1,477\n2,390\n3,258\n3,537\n3,641\nNon-GAAP Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to net income excluding the impact of\nstock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, loss on debt\nredemption/conversion, equity (income) loss in investee, acquisition-related and other non-recurring\nexpenses, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments.

In particular, Xilinx does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections or\nforecasts as to its future revenues, earnings or other results due to the uncertainty of the underlying\nassumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the merger, Xilinx management shared its five-year\nlong-range plan, which is referred to as the \u201cLRP.\u201d The LRP is updated each year and reviewed with the Xilinx\nboard of directors in the fiscal year-end timeframe, coinciding with Xilinx year-end procedures. Xilinx shared\nthe LRP projections with AMD and the supporting financial advisors, including BofA Securities, Credit\nSuisse, DBO and Morgan Stanley, with certain minor variations in the LRP projections provided to AMD and\nthe financial advisors for each of AMD and Xilinx as described below under \u201c-Summary of Xilinx Financial\nProjections.\u201d Also in connection with the merger, Xilinx received certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation concerning AMD for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, which Xilinx management adjusted to\nmoderate the growth rate to reflect the competitive environment. These adjusted projections for the years\nending December 2020 through December 2023 are referred to as the \u201cXilinx adjusted AMD projections.\u201d The\nLRP, the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections, the Xilinx LRP extrapolations as described below under \u201c-Summary\nof Xilinx Financial Projections\u201d and the Xilinx adjusted AMD projections as described below under \u201c-Summary\nof Xilinx Adjusted AMD Projections\u201d are referred to collectively as the \u201cXilinx unaudited projections.\u201d\nBecause the LRP was prepared before the COVID-19 pandemic was well-understood and before the 2020 U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce rule changes for trade with Huawei and other customers in China, Xilinx management\nalso provided a revised forecast, solely for revenue, updated for those environmental headwinds, as further\ndiscussed below. Xilinx shared the revenue forecast update with AMD and the supporting financial advisors,\nincluding BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, DBO and Morgan Stanley.\nThe Xilinx unaudited projections were prepared treating Xilinx and AMD, respectively, on a standalone basis,\nwithout giving effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger, the\nexpenses that may be incurred in connection with the merger or the consummation thereof, the potential\nsynergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect of any business\nor strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been\nexecuted or in anticipation of the merger, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which\nwould likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered,\nwould likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered,\naccelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, Xilinx and\nAMD management also prepared and agreed certain estimates of the annual cost synergies estimated to be\nrecognized by the combined company in connection with the merger. The estimated synergies are not reflected\nin the Xilinx unaudited projections.\u200b\nThe Xilinx unaudited projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward\ncompliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or GAAP, but, in the view of\nXilinx management were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best available estimates and judgments\nat the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of management\u2019s knowledge\nand belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Xilinx. However, this\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and\nreaders of this joint proxy statement / prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Xilinx\nunaudited projections or the estimated synergies. Although Xilinx management believes there is a reasonable\nbasis for the Xilinx unaudited projections, Xilinx cautions stockholders that future results could be materially\ndifferent from the\n144 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nunaudited projections. This summary of the Xilinx unaudited projections is not being included in this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus to influence any decision whether to vote for the Xilinx merger proposal, but\nbecause the Xilinx unaudited projections were provided to Xilinx\u2019s financial advisors and the Xilinx board of\ndirectors for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger.

These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons,\nincluding general economic conditions, trends in the semiconductor industry, including trends in capital\nspending, inventory and unit production, competition and the risks discussed under \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Also see \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d The Xilinx unaudited projections, the AMD projections and the estimated synergies also reflect\nassumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.

AMD and Xilinx management agreed that the estimated synergies include\napproximately $300 million of cost synergies estimated to be potentially realizable within 18 months\nsubsequent to closing, which are referred to as the \u201cestimated synergies.\u201d The estimated synergies were\nprovided to the AMD and Xilinx boards of directors and to their respective financial advisors.\nThe estimated synergies assumed that the expected benefits of the merger would be realized, including that no\nrestrictions, terms or other conditions would be imposed in connection with the receipt of any necessary\ngovernmental, regulatory or other approvals or consents in connection with the consummation of the merger.\nSee \u201c-AMD Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d and \u201c-Xilinx Unaudited Financial Projections\u201d for further\ninformation regarding the uncertainties underlying the estimated synergies, as well as under \u201cCautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further information regarding the\nuncertainties and factors associated with realizing the synergies in connection with the merger.\n148 \n (1)\n (2)\n (3)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place on a date to be designated jointly by AMD and Xilinx, which date will\nbe no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the last of\nthe conditions to closing (described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the\nMerger\u201d) to be satisfied or waived (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the\nclosing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the closing), unless another\ndate is agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx.\nAt the closing, the parties to the merger agreement will cause a certificate of merger relating to the merger to\nbe executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or\nrecordings required by the DGCL in connection with effecting the merger. The merger will become effective at\nthe time when the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such\nlater time as may be agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx and specified in the certificate of merger.\nAMD and Xilinx currently expect the merger to close by the end of the 2021 calendar year and are working to\ncomplete the merger on this timeline and prior to the end date of October 26, 2021 (which is subject to\nextension in certain circumstances related to the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the absence of\nrestraints under certain competition laws to January 26, 2022 or April 26, 2022 pursuant to the terms of the\nmerger agreement). However, it is possible that factors outside the control of the parties to the merger\nagreement could result in the merger being completed at a different time, or not at all.\nRegulatory Approvals\nUnder the merger agreement, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have each agreed to cooperate with each other and\nto use (and to cause their respective subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,\nall actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the closing to be\nsatisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end date) and to\nconsummate the merger, including to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) the regulatory\napprovals described above as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the end\ndate), subject to the limitations described below. In the event that any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,\nwhether judicial or administrative, is commenced challenging the merger or the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement as violative of any competition law, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx will\ncooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to defend any such lawsuit or legal\nproceeding.\nHowever, AMD will not be required to do any of the following in order to obtain any regulatory approval or\notherwise to consummate the merger, and any requirement to do any of the following in order to obtain a\nrequired regulatory approval would result in the conditions to the consummation of the merger not being\nsatisfied, unless waived by AMD: (a) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of,\nor (b) grant any non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to any actions\nwhich restrictions or actions would limit AMD\u2019s or any of its affiliates\u2019 freedom of action, in each case with\nrespect to assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of AMD, Xilinx or either\u2019s respective\nsubsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse\neffect on (A) Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) AMD and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole),\nbut for purposes of clause (B), deemed to be the same size as Xilinx and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole).\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary, without the prior written consent of AMD, neither Xilinx nor any of\nits subsidiaries or affiliates will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or\notherwise) to any third party in connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\nIf reaching agreement with the applicable governmental entity would require AMD to agree to or effect any\nundertaking in excess of the limitations described above, AMD may either agree to or effect such an\nundertaking\n149 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nor continue to attempt to obtain approval of the applicable governmental entity. If such an agreement is not\nreached or undertaking not effected prior to the end date, the conditions to the closing of the merger would\nnot be satisfied and either company would be permitted to terminate the merger agreement. AMD would be\nrequired to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion if the merger agreement is terminated:\nby AMD or Xilinx pursuant to the right of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the merger\nhas not been consummated by the end date and as of such termination the only conditions to closing\nthat were not satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are satisfied on the closing\ndate, provided such conditions would have been capable of satisfaction if the closing occurred on\nthe termination date) were the condition related to illegality or injunction arising under competition\nlaws or the condition related to receipt of regulatory approvals\u037e or\nby AMD or Xilinx due to the existence of a final and non-appealable order or law that permanently\nrestrains, enjoins or makes illegal consummation of the merger and the law is a competition law or the\norder is issued pursuant to a competition law and all other conditions to AMD\u2019s obligation to close\nwould have been capable of satisfaction if the closing occurred on the termination date.\nAMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx have agreed that AMD will have the ultimate right to devise the strategy and\ndirect all matters for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,\nnotice, petition, statement, registration, submission, application or similar regulatory approval, taking into\naccount in good faith any comments of Xilinx. However, each party will consult and coordinate with each\nother with respect to interactions with and filings submitted to the government. Additionally, each party is\nrequired to (a) promptly notify the other parties to the merger agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other\nparties with copies of, any communication from or to any governmental entity regarding the merger, (b) permit\nthe other parties to the merger agreement to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the\nviews of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any governmental entity and\n(c) to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental entity, give the other parties reasonable opportunity\nto attend and participate in any in-person meetings, video conferences or teleconferences with such\ngovernmental entity regarding the merger.\nSee \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to the Merger.\u201d\nOwnership of the Combined Company\nBased on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock outstanding on February 10, 2021, the latest\npracticable date prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, upon completion of the merger,\nformer Xilinx stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.9% of the outstanding shares of AMD\ncommon stock and AMD stockholders immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately\n74.1% of the outstanding shares of AMD common stock. The relative ownership interests of AMD\nstockholders and former Xilinx stockholders in the combined company immediately following the merger will\ndepend on the number of shares of AMD and Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior\nto the merger.\nBoard of Directors of the Combined Company\nAMD has agreed to appoint at least two members of the Xilinx board of directors to the AMD board of\ndirectors as of the effective time, with such directors to hold office until the earliest to occur of the\nappointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation,\ndisqualification or proper removal. Each such director must qualify as an \u201cindependent director\u201d under\napplicable Nasdaq rules and regulations and will be designated by the AMD board of directors after\nreasonable consultation with, and reasonable consideration of, the recommendations of Xilinx. AMD has\nagreed to nominate such directors for reelection at the first annual meeting of AMD stockholders that occurs\nafter the closing.\nU.S. Federal Securities Law Consequences\nAssuming the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus forms a part, the shares of AMD common stock issued in the merger will not be subject\nto any\n150 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nrestrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except for shares of AMD\ncommon stock issued to any Xilinx stockholder who may be deemed an \u201caffiliate\u201d of AMD after the\ncompletion of the merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of shares of AMD\ncommon stock received by any person upon the completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to\nmake any use of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, or the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this\njoint proxy statement/\u200bprospectus forms a part, in connection with any resale of shares of AMD common stock.\nAccounting Treatment\nAMD prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the\nacquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD\nrepresenting the accounting acquirer under this guidance. AMD will record assets acquired, including\nidentifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their respective fair values at the date of\ncompletion of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price (as described in Note 2 (Basis of Pro Forma\nPresentation) to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements) over the net fair value of\nsuch assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of AMD after completion of the merger will reflect Xilinx after\ncompletion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or\nresults of operations of Xilinx. The earnings of AMD following completion of the merger will reflect\nacquisition accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and\nliabilities on depreciation expense and amortization expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and\nintangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the\nfuture, AMD determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, AMD would\nrecord an impairment charge at that time.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nOn December 7, 2020, a purported Xilinx stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of California against Xilinx and the Xilinx board of directors, captioned Stein v.

In particular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the\nparties to the merger agreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the\nparties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties\nmay also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from that generally relevant\nto stockholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by\nconfidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the\nmerger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement\nwill not survive the completion of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. If specific material facts\nexist that contradict the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement, AMD\nand Xilinx have disclosed those material facts in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. If subsequent\ninformation concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the\nmerger agreement has not been reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, each of AMD and Xilinx will\nmake publicly available any material information necessary to provide stockholders a materially complete\nunderstanding of the provisions of the merger agreement.For the foregoing reasons, the representations,\nwarranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead\nshould be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and\nin the public filings AMD and Xilinx make with the SEC.\nAdditional information about AMD and Xilinx can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and in the public filings AMD and Xilinx make with the SEC.

At\nthe effective time, all of the property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of Xilinx and Merger Sub will\nvest in Xilinx as the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties\nof Xilinx and Merger Sub will become debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of Xilinx as the\nsurviving corporation.\nCompletion and Effectiveness of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place on a date to be designated jointly by AMD and Xilinx, which date will\nbe no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the last of\nthe conditions to closing (described under \u201c-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger\u201d) to be satisfied or\nwaived (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the closing), unless another date is agreed to in writing by\nAMD and Xilinx. The date on which the closing occurs is referred to as the \u201cclosing date.\u201d\nAt the closing, the parties to the merger agreement will cause a certificate of merger relating to the merger to\nbe executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or\nrecordings required by the DGCL in connection with the merger. The merger will become effective at the time\nwhen the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time\nas may be agreed to in writing by AMD and Xilinx and specified in the certificate of merger.\nMerger Consideration\nAt the effective time, automatically, by virtue of the merger and without any further action on the part of\nXilinx, Xilinx stockholders, AMD or Merger Sub:\nall shares of Xilinx common stock that are held in treasury by Xilinx or are held directly by AMD or\nMerger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no\nconsideration will be paid or payable in respect thereof\u037e\nexcept as described in the preceding bullet, each share of Xilinx common stock that is issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive, without\ninterest, 1.7234 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of AMD common stock\u037e and\neach share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-\nassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Xilinx as the surviving corporation.\nTreatment of Fractional Shares\nNo fractional shares of AMD common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Each Xilinx\nstockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the merger a fractional share of AMD\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger agreement will, in lieu of such fractional share and upon surrender of\nsuch holder\u2019s certificates representing shares of Xilinx common stock or book-entry positions representing\nnon-certificated shares of Xilinx common stock, in each case outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest and\nsubject to any required tax withholding, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of the\nvolume-weighted average trading prices per share of AMD common stock on Nasdaq (as reported by\nBloomberg L.P.) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the trading day that is\nthree trading days prior to the date of the effective time. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting\nrights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of AMD common stock that would otherwise have\nbeen issuable as part of the merger consideration. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests\nmerely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.\n155 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExchange of Shares\nExchange Agent\nPrior to the closing date, AMD will select its transfer agent or, after consultation with Xilinx, another reputable\nbank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to both parties to act as exchange agent with respect to the\nmerger.\nAt or prior to the effective time, AMD will deposit with the exchange agent (a) certificates or evidence of\nbook-entry shares representing the shares of AMD common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement\nand (b) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the merger agreement.\nExchange of Xilinx Stock Certificates and Xilinx Book-Entry Shares\nWith respect to certificates representing shares of Xilinx common stock, which are referred to collectively as\n\u201cXilinx stock certificates,\u201d as promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the exchange agent\nwill mail to each holder of record of each such Xilinx stock certificate (a) a notice advising such holder of the\neffectiveness of the merger, (b) a letter of transmittal and (c) instructions for surrendering Xilinx stock\ncertificates in exchange for the merger consideration.\nUpon surrender of a Xilinx stock certificate and a duly executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent in\ncompliance with the instructions for surrender, the exchange agent will mail to each holder of record, as\npromptly as reasonably practicable thereafter:\na statement reflecting the number of whole shares of AMD common stock, if any, that such holder is\nentitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement in non-certificated book-entry form in the name\nof such record holder\u037e and\na check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in the merger\nagreement) of (a) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock plus (b) any unpaid\ncash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to\nreceive pursuant to the merger agreement.\nWith respect to book-entry positions representing non-certificated shares of Xilinx common stock, which are\nreferred to as \u201cXilinx book-entry shares,\u201d that are not held through DTC, the exchange agent will pay and\ndeliver to each holder of record of any such share as promptly as reasonable practicable after the effective\ntime, but in any event within three business days thereafter:\nthe merger consideration\u037e and\na check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in the merger\nagreement) of (a) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMD common stock plus (b) any unpaid\ncash dividends and any other dividends or distributions that such holder has the right to receive\npursuant to the merger agreement.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn October 26, 2020, AMD, Merger Sub and Xilinx entered into the merger agreement, pursuant to which\nMerger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of AMD. Upon successful completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Xilinx\ncommon stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical\nfinancial statements and related notes of AMD and Xilinx, and the other information regarding AMD and\nXilinx that is contained or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on and have been derived from\nthe historical financial statements of AMD and Xilinx, including AMD\u2019s audited consolidated statement of\noperations for its fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 and audited consolidated balance sheet as of December\n26, 2020, and Xilinx\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended\nMarch 28, 2020, unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended\nJanuary 2, 2021, and unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2021. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation\nS-X.\nAMD\u2019s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December of each year and Xilinx\u2019s fiscal year ends on the\nSaturday nearest March 31 of each year. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of\noperations is presented on the basis of AMD\u2019s fiscal year and combine the historical results of the fiscal\nperiods of AMD and Xilinx. Since AMD\u2019s and Xilinx\u2019s fiscal year ends differ by more than 93 days, pursuant\nto Rule 11-02(c)(3) of Regulation S-X, AMD combines its statement of operations for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 26, 2020 and those of Xilinx for each of the three months ended March 28, 2020, June 27, 2020,\nSeptember 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\nstatements are presented on the basis of AMD\u2019s fiscal year and combine the historical results of the fiscal\nperiods of AMD and Xilinx. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines AMD\u2019s\naudited balance sheet as of December 26, 2020 and Xilinx\u2019s unaudited balance sheet as of January 2, 2021.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred\non December 26, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal\nyear ended December 26, 2020 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December 29, 2019. In the\nopinion of AMD management, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect\nadjustments that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation as of and for the periods indicated, and the pro forma adjustments are based on currently available\ninformation and assumptions AMD believes are factually supportable, directly attributable to the merger and,\nwith respect to the statement of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined\ncompany.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared for illustrative\npurposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the combined company\u2019s financial position or results\nof operations actually would have been had the merger occurred as of the dates indicated. The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial statements also should not be considered indicative of the future results\nof operations or financial position of AMD or Xilinx.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations and unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined balance sheet give pro forma effect to the consummation of the merger on the terms provided for in\nthe merger agreement. The unaudited merger pro forma adjustments reflect adjustments related to the\napplication of the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the merger and the preliminary fair\nvalue estimate of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed.\n181 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe merger is subject to closing adjustments that have not yet been finalized. Accordingly, the pro forma\nadjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined financial statements as required by SEC rules. Differences between these preliminary\nestimates and the final merger accounting may be material.\n182 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. \nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED

Xilinx,\npursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into\nXilinx, with Xilinx surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD.\nUnder the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx common stock held\ndirectly by AMD or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-\nassessable shares of AMD common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any\napplicable withholding.\nAt the effective time, (i) all Xilinx RSUs with vesting criteria based on continuing service that are outstanding\nand held by Xilinx employees immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into\nrestricted stock units denominated in shares of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio, (ii) all Xilinx\nRSUs with performance-based vesting criteria that are outstanding and held by Xilinx employees immediately\nprior to the effective time, after giving effect to Xilinx\u2019s determination, based on actual, or, in the event\nconsummation of the merger occurs during or after Xilinx\u2019s fiscal year 2022, the greater of target-level and\nactual, performance through a date that is not less than ten business days prior to the effective time, of Xilinx\nRSUs earned, will be (to the extent earned) automatically converted into restricted stock units denominated in\nshares of AMD common stock based on the exchange ratio and all unearned performance-based Xilinx RSUs\nforfeited, (iii) all Xilinx options held by Xilinx employees that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the\neffective time (if any) will be automatically converted into options to acquire a number of shares of AMD\ncommon stock determined based on the exchange ratio (with the exercise price being adjusted based on the\nexchange ratio) and (iv) all Xilinx options and Xilinx RSUs held by non-employee members of the Xilinx board\nof directors shall accelerate in full and, in the case of Xilinx RSUs, become settled. Aside from the foregoing\nadjustments, the awards will generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions that\napplied to the awards immediately prior to the effective time.\nThe merger has been unanimously approved by the respective AMD and Xilinx boards of directors. However,\nthe merger is subject to approval by AMD and Xilinx stockholders, certain regulatory approvals and other\ncustomary closing conditions. The merger is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021.\nNote 2-Basis of Pro Forma Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared in\naccordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X. AMD has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last\nSaturday in December and Xilinx has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31.\nTo comply with SEC rules and regulations for companies with different fiscal year ends, the pro forma\ncondensed combined financial statements have been prepared utilizing periods that differ by less than 93\ndays. Given the different fiscal year ends of AMD and Xilinx, the Xilinx historical unaudited condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended January 2, 2021 is derived from the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the three months ended March 28,\n2020, June 27, 2020, September 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021. The AMD historical unaudited condensed\nfinancial statement of operations data are derived from AMD\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements for\nthe fiscal year ended December 26, 2020.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred\non December 26, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal\nyear ended December 26, 2020 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December 29, 2019, the\nbeginning of AMD\u2019s fiscal 2020 year. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations\nis presented on the basis of AMD\u2019s fiscal year and combines the historical results of the fiscal periods of\nAMD and Xilinx. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines AMD\u2019s audited\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2020 and Xilinx\u2019s unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of\nJanuary 2, 2021.\n185 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThese unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using the\nacquisition method of accounting in accordance with the business combination provisions of ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations, with AMD representing the acquirer under this guidance. In the unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined balance sheet, AMD\u2019s costs to acquire Xilinx have been allocated to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed, based upon management\u2019s preliminary estimate of what their respective fair values\nwould be as of the date of the merger. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and are based upon available\ninformation and certain assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and\nwhich are described in the accompanying notes herein. Actual results may differ materially from the\nassumptions within the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.\nUnder ASC 805, generally all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair\nvalue. For purposes of the pro forma information presented herein, the fair value of Xilinx\u2019s identifiable\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on a preliminary estimate of fair\nvalue. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized as goodwill. Management believes the estimated fair values\nutilized for the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed are based on reasonable estimates and\nassumptions. Certain current market-based assumptions were used which will be updated upon completion of\nthe merger. Preliminary fair value estimates may change as additional information becomes available and such\nchanges could be material, as certain valuations and other studies have yet to commence or progress to a\nstage where there is sufficient information for definitive measurement, including inventory, property and\nequipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and their related tax impact. Following the consummation of the\nmerger, management will conduct a final review. As a result of that review, management may identify\ndifferences that, when finalized, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial statements.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to matters that are (i) directly\nattributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the statement of operations,\nexpected to have a continuing impact on the operating results of the combined company. The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any anticipated\nsynergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the merger transactions or of any\nintegration costs.\nThese unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with:\nthe separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of AMD for the year ended\nDecember 26, 2020, included in AMD\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 29,\n2021\u037e\nthe separate historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Xilinx as of and for\nthe nine months ended January 2, 2021, included in Xilinx\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with\nthe SEC on January 28, 2021\u037e and\nthe separate historical audited consolidated financial statements of Xilinx for the year ended March\n28, 2020, included in Xilinx\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 8, 2020.\nNote 3-Conforming Accounting Policies\nAt this time, AMD is not aware of any material differences between the accounting policies of the two\ncompanies that would continue to exist subsequent to the application of acquisition accounting. Following\nthe consummation of the merger, AMD will conduct a more detailed review of Xilinx\u2019s accounting policies to\ndetermine if differences in accounting policies require further reclassification of Xilinx\u2019s results of operations\nor reclassification of assets or liabilities to conform to AMD\u2019s accounting policies and classifications. As a\nresult, AMD may identify additional differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that,\nwhen conformed, could have a material impact on these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\nstatements.\n186 \n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNote 4-Reclassifications\nThe following reclassification adjustments were made to conform the presentation of Xilinx\u2019s financial\ninformation to AMD\u2019s presentation as indicated in the table below:\nBalance Sheet as of December 26, 2020\nAmount \n(in millions)\nPresentation in Xilinx\u2019s Historical\nFinancial \nStatements\nPresentation in Unaudited Pro Forma \nCondensed Combined Financial\nStatements\n$\u200749\nOther non-current assets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\u2002163\nOther non-current assets\nDeferred tax assets\n\u2002314\nAccrued payroll and related\nliabilities\nAccrued liabilities\n\u2002\u200730\nIncome taxes payable\nOther current liabilities\n\u2002\u200711\nOther accrued liabilities\nOther current liabilities\n\u2002149\nOther accrued liabilities\nAccrued liabilities\n\u2002\u200741\nOther long-term liabilities\nLong-term operating lease\nliabilities\n\u2002473\nLong-term income taxes payable\nOther long-term liabilities\nStatement of Operations for the Year Ended December 26, 2020\nAmount \n(in millions)\nPresentation in Xilinx\u2019s Historical\nFinancial \nStatements\nPresentation in Unaudited Pro\nForma \nCondensed Combined Financial\nStatements\n$(50)\nInterest and other income (expense),\nnet\nInterest expense\n\u200243\nInterest and other income (expense),\nnet\nOther expense, net\nNote 5-Preliminary Merger Consideration and Allocation\nPreliminary Merger Consideration\nThe preliminary merger consideration is approximately $39,321 million, based on the closing price of AMD\ncommon stock on the Nasdaq of $92.35 on February 10, 2021. The aggregate value of the merger consideration\nwill fluctuate based upon changes in the price of AMD common stock and the number of shares of Xilinx\ncommon stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, including shares subject to Xilinx restricted\nstock awards outstanding on the closing date. The preliminary merger consideration is as follows:\n(Share amounts and dollars in millions, except share price data)\u200b\nEstimated Xilinx common shares\n246 \nExchange ratio\n1.7234\nAMD shares to be issued in exchange\n424\nAMD closing share price\n$ 92.35\nTotal preliminary merger consideration to be paid at closing\n39,115\nFair value of estimated RSUs assumed (including Xilinx\nperformance-based RSUs converted to RSUs)\n1,053\nLess: Estimated fair value of RSUs to be expensed\n(847\nEstimated value of AMD replacement equity awards\nattributable \nto precombination service\n206\nTotal preliminary merger consideration\n$ 39,321\nThe estimate is based on 246 million shares of Xilinx common stock issued and outstanding as of\nFebruary 10, 2021, which includes 7,587 Xilinx RSUs which have vested but are yet to be settled.\nBased on the closing price of AMD common stock on the Nasdaq on February 10, 2021.\n187 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n)(3)\n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$1.1 billion represents the estimated fair value of Xilinx RSUs that will be assumed by AMD upon\ncompletion of the merger. $847 million represents the estimated fair value of Xilinx RSUs to be expensed\nover the future service period. The final value of Xilinx RSUs will be impacted by changes in the price of\nAMD common stock and the number of Xilinx RSUs vested at the actual date of the closing of the merger.\nThe cash consideration for any fractional shares of AMD common stock that may become payable in respect\nof shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time has not been estimated\nnor included in the purchase price presented for pro forma purposes.\nThe final merger consideration could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial statements primarily due to movements in the price of AMD common\nstock and the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time on\nthe closing date of the merger. A 25% fluctuation in the market price of AMD common stock would affect the\nvalue of the preliminary merger consideration reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information with a corresponding change to goodwill related to the transaction, as illustrated in the\ntable below:\nChange in Stock Price\nStock\nPrice\nEstimated \nMerger \nConsideration\n(in millions)\nEstimated\nChange\ni n \nGoodwill \n(in\nmillions)\n25% increase in stock price\n$115.44\n$\n49,151\n$\n9,830\n25% decrease in stock price\n$ 69.26\n$\n29,491\n$ (9,830\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Xilinx\nare recorded at their fair values as of the merger date and added to those of AMD. The purchase price\nallocation shown below is preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and has been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the merger. For the\npreliminary estimate of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Xilinx, AMD used certain\nassumptions based on publicly available transaction data for the industry. The final purchase price allocation\nis dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have yet to be completed. Accordingly, the\npreliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes\navailable and as additional analyses and final valuations are completed, and such differences could have a\nmaterial impact on the final purchase price allocation.\n188 \n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table sets forth a preliminary allocation of the total preliminary merger consideration to the\nidentifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Xilinx, based on management\u2019s\npreliminary estimate of their fair values as of December 26, 2020:\nHistorical\nFair Value \nAdjustment\nFair \nValue\nPreliminary merger consideration\n$39,321\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,126\n$\n-\u2007\n1,126\nShort-term investments\n2,199\n-\u2007\n2,199\nAccounts receivable, net\n270\n-\u2007\n270\nInventories\n300\n-\u2007\n300\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n72\n-\u2007\n72\nNet property, plant and equipment\n352\n-\u2007\n352\nAcquisition-related intangibles, net\n182\n13,832\n14,014\nOther assets\n627\n(163\n464\nTotal assets\n5,128\n13,669\n18,797\nAccounts payable\n110\n-\u2007\n110\nAccrued payroll and related liabilities\n314\n314\nIncome taxes payable\n30\n-\u2007\n30\nOther accrued liabilities\n160\n-\u2007\n160\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n500\n3\n503\nLong-term debt\n1,492\n100\n1,592\nLong-term income taxes payable\n473\n-\u2007\n473\nOther long-term liabilities\n71\n2,499\n2,570\nTotal liabilities\n3,150\n2,602\n5,752\nFair value of net assets acquired\n13,045\nGoodwill\n$26,276\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of the underlying net assets\nacquired. In accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but\ninstead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill is\nattributable to the assembled workforce of Xilinx, planned growth in new markets and synergies expected to be\nachieved from the combined operations of AMD and Xilinx. Goodwill recorded in the merger is not expected to\nbe deductible for tax purposes.\nThe fair value adjustments as shown above are further described below in Notes 6 and 7.\nOther Long-term Liabilities\nThe adjustment to Other long-term liabilities relates to deferred tax liabilities, which will be recorded at the\neffective date of the merger and which principally represent the deferred tax impact associated with the\nincremental differences in book and tax basis of acquired intangible assets. Deferred taxes associated with\nestimated fair value adjustments are computed using an estimated blended statutory U.S. federal and state tax\nrate and statutory Singapore foreign tax rate. For balance sheet purposes, where U.S. tax rates were used, rates\nwere based on recently enacted U.S. tax law, and for statement of operations purposes, where U.S. tax rates\nwere used, rates were based on the tax laws applicable to the respective periods. The effective tax rate of the\ncombined company could be significantly different (either higher or lower) depending on post-merger\nactivities, including post-acquisition activities, cash needs, the geographical mix of income and changes in tax\nlaw. This determination is preliminary and subject to change based upon the final determination of the fair\nvalue of the identifiable intangible assets and liabilities.\n189 \n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntangible Assets\nPreliminary identifiable intangible assets in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation consist of the following:\nFair Value\n(in\nMillions)\nWeighted Average \nEstimated Useful\nLife \n(in Years)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n7,260\n7\nCustomer relationships\n5,065\n7\nTrade name\n169\n4\nIdentified intangible assets subject to amortization\n12,494\nIn-process research and development not subject\nto amortization\n1,520\nN/A\nTotal identified intangible assets\n$\n14,014\nThe fair value estimate for all identifiable intangible assets is preliminary and is based on assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e.,\nits highest and best use). The final fair value determination for identifiable intangible assets may differ\nmaterially from this preliminary determination.\nThe amortization related to the identifiable intangible assets is reflected as a pro forma adjustment in the\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations based on the estimated useful lives above.\nNote 6.

AMD has\ncomputed deferred tax impacts assuming Xilinx as a member of the combined company\u2019s U.S. consolidated tax\nreturn following the acquisition. The final determination of the treatment of AMD and Xilinx associated with\nthe U.S. tax filings may differ as a result of subsequent changes in tax laws and integration activities. The\nacquired intangible assets resulted in a net deferred tax liability position for the combined company. Therefore,\nthe deferred tax assets have been reclassified to reflect a net deferred tax liability.\n(b) Represents adjustments to the combined company accrued liabilities balance for (i) Xilinx retention\nbonuses and (ii) AMD and Xilinx transaction costs anticipated to be paid in connection with completing the\nmerger. An adjustment for total additional retention bonuses of $41 million for Xilinx employees reflects the\nfull expected payable amount assuming all eligible employees remain employed through the applicable payout\ndates. Total additional transaction costs of $138 million are expected, of which $126 million would be paid in\ncash and which is reflected as an increase to accrued liabilities, with the remaining $12 million, which is\npayable either in AMD common stock or cash, assumed to be paid in AMD common stock and reflected as an\nincrease in additional paid-in capital. Also see Note 6(d). Accrued liabilities do not include (i) transaction\ncosts of $20 million payable at closing solely at the discretion of AMD and (ii) transaction costs of up to $40\nmillion that are payable based upon the value of Xilinx shares at closing.\n191 \n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAmount \n(in\nmillions)\nAdditional retention bonus accrual\n$\n41\nAdditional transaction cost accrual\n126\nAdjustment to accrued liabilities\n$\n167\n(c) Reflects the elimination of Xilinx\u2019s historical common stock, capital in excess of par value and accumulated\nother comprehensive income, as well as adjustments to reflect the value of shares exchanged, and replacement\nequity awards.\nCommon Stock\nAmount \n(in\nmillions)\nElimination of par value of Xilinx\u2019s historical common stock\n$\n(2\nEstimated par value of AMD common stock issued for outstanding\nshares \nof Xilinx common stock\n4\nAdjustment to common stock\n$\n2\nAdditional Paid-in Capital\nAmount \n(in\nmillions)\nElimination of Xilinx\u2019s historical additional paid-in capital\n$ (1,284\nEstimated value of AMD common stock issued for outstanding shares\nof Xilinx common stock\n39,115\nEstimated value of AMD common stock issued for transaction cost\nupon close\n12\nEstimated par value of AMD common stock issued for outstanding\nshares \nof Xilinx common stock\n(4\nEstimated value of AMD replacement equity awards attributable to\nprecombination service\n206\nAdjustment to additional paid-in capital\n$ 38,045\n192 \n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(d) Reflects the adjustment to AMD\u2019s accumulated deficit to (i) eliminate Xilinx\u2019s historical retained earnings\nafter pro forma adjustments, (ii) record Xilinx retention bonuses and (iii) record transaction costs. The\ntransaction costs primarily consist of fees for investment banking, legal and accounting services. The\nadjustments for Xilinx retention bonuses transaction costs are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined statement of operations because they are nonrecurring items that are directly\nattributable to the merger.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF AMD\nSet forth below is information concerning corporate governance of AMD. The definitive proxy statement for\nAMD\u2019s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders may include additional information related to the topics\ndiscussed below. As used in this section, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to AMD, the term \u201cBoard\u201d\nrefers to the AMD board of directors, and references to committees refer to the applicable committees of the\nBoard.\nThe Board has adopted the Governance Principles to address significant corporate governance matters. The\nGovernance Principles provide a framework for our corporate governance matters and include topics such as\nBoard and Board committee composition and evaluation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee is responsible for reviewing the Governance Principles and recommending any changes to the\nGovernance Principles to the Board.\nIndependence of Directors\nThe Governance Principles provide that a substantial majority of the members of the Board must meet the\ncriteria for independence as required by applicable law and the listing rules of Nasdaq. Among other criteria,\nno director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct material\nrelationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in\ncarrying out the responsibilities of a director. On an annual basis, the Board undertakes a review of director\nindependence. The Board determined that all directors who served during fiscal 2020, other than Dr. Su, are\nindependent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules.\nIn making its independence determinations, the Board reviewed direct and indirect transactions and\nrelationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family, and us or one of our\nsubsidiaries or affiliates based on information provided by the director, our records and publicly available\ninformation. All of the reviewed transactions and arrangements were entered into in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and none of the transactions or arrangements involved an amount that (i) exceeded the greater of 5%\nof the recipient entity\u2019s revenues or $200,000 with respect to transactions where a director or any member of\nhis or her immediate family or spouse served in any capacity other than as a director of a publicly held\ncorporation or (ii) exceeded $10,000 with respect to professional or consulting services provided by entities at\nwhich our directors serve as professors or employees.\nThe Board determined that none of our directors currently has or has had any direct or indirect material\ninterest in any transactions and arrangements that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment\nas members of the Board. The Board also determined that each of the members of the Audit and Finance\nCommittee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Leadership\nResources Committee (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) are independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq\nrules.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nDuring fiscal 2020, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan and Talwalkar served on the Compensation Committee.\nNone of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an executive officer or employee of AMD.\nIn addition, none of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a\ncompany which has an executive officer who serves on the Board or the Compensation Committee.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Governance Principles permit the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be filled\nby the same or different individuals, based on our needs, best practices and the interests of our stockholders.\nThis allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined or separated based\nupon our\n204 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nneeds and the Board\u2019s assessment of its leadership from time to time. The Board has the experience of\nfunctioning effectively either way. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with an\nindependent Chairman of the Board, separate from the Chief Executive Officer, is the most appropriate\nleadership structure for the Company at this time, is in the best interests of the stockholders and allows the\nBoard to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently based on our current needs. Mr. Caldwell, who is\nindependent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules, is our Chairman of the Board. Mr. Caldwell presides at\nmeetings of our stockholders and directors and leads the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Board\nbenefits from Mr. Caldwell\u2019s extensive and diversified leadership experience, financial management and risk\nassessment experience. He also has strong public company board experience and has intimate familiarity with\nour history and business.\nSeparating the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer also enables the independent\ndirectors to more meaningfully participate in the leadership of the Board. The Board currently believes this\nstructure provides an appropriate degree of oversight and allows Dr. Su, our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, to focus on our business strategy and market opportunities, as well as on our organizational structure\nand execution capabilities.\nRisk Oversight\nThe Board\u2019s role in risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with our Chief Executive Officer\nand other members of management having responsibility for day-to-day risk management activities and\nprocesses, and the Board and its committees being actively involved in overseeing our risk management. The\nBoard and management consider \u201crisk\u201d for these purposes to be the possibility of an undesired occurrence\nthat could threaten the viability of the company, result in a material destruction of our assets or stockholder\nvalue, or materially impact our long-term performance. Examples of the types of risks faced by us include:\nbusiness-specific risks related to our ability to develop new products and services, our strategic\nposition in key existing and new markets, our operational execution and infrastructure, our\nrelationships with our third-party manufacturing suppliers and competition in the microprocessor and\ngraphics markets\u037e\nmacroeconomic risks, such as adverse global economic conditions and global geo-political events\u037e\nand\n\u201cevent\u201d risks, such as pandemics, natural disasters and cybersecurity threats.\nDuring 2020, the Board and its committees also discussed with management strategies to address the impact\nof COVID-19 on employees and our business operations and practices, including taking measures to protect\nthe health and safety of our employees and monitoring demand signals to assess supply chain requirements\nand product schedules and roadmaps.\nWe engage in value-creating strategies and activities that appropriately balances returns with risk. We\nmitigate potential exposures through our proactive risk management systems. Our senior management\nparticipates in the identification and assessment of the inherent risks that impact our business and develops\nprocesses and controls and other measures designed to mitigate those risks. Our Chief Executive Officer has\nultimate responsibility for management of our business, including enterprise level risks and the risk\nmanagement program and processes.\nIn fulfilling its oversight role, the Board focuses on understanding the nature of our enterprise risks, including\nrisks in our operations, finance and strategy, organization, compliance and external exposures as well as the\nadequacy of our risk assessment and risk management processes. The Board has implemented a risk oversight\nmodel that delegates certain risks to its committees and retains other risks at the Board-level. The Board and\ncommittees periodically receive reports and updates from management. At least annually, the Board discusses\nwith management the appropriate level of risk relative to our strategy and objectives and reviews with\nmanagement our existing risk management processes and their effectiveness. The Board also receives periodic\n205 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement updates on our operations, organization, financial position and results and strategy and, as\nappropriate, discusses and provides feedback with respect to risks related to these topics. In addition, the\nBoard receives full reports from the following Board committee chairs regarding each committee\u2019s\nconsiderations and actions related to the specific risk topics over which the committee has oversight:\nThe Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in overseeing our enterprise risk management\nprocess, including the company\u2019s financial and information technology (including product security\nand cybersecurity) risk exposures\u037e reviews our portfolio of risk\u037e discusses with management\nsignificant financial, reporting, regulatory and legal compliance risks in conjunction with enterprise\nrisk exposures as well as risks associated with our capital structure\u037e reviews our policies with respect\nto risk assessment and risk management and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or\ncontrol financial and enterprise risk exposure\u037e business continuity\u037e and emerging risks. The Audit and\nFinance Committee meets with members of our Internal Audit department to discuss any issues that\nwarrant attention.\nThe Compensation Committee oversees risk management as it relates to our compensation policies\nand practices as well as talent management and development applicable to all employees. It reviews\nwith management whether our compensation programs may create incentives for our employees to\ntake excessive or inappropriate risks which could be reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on us. For additional details, see \u201cCompensation Policies and Practices.\u201d Additionally, the\nCompensation Committee oversees organizational risks, including leadership succession, talent\ncapacity, capabilities, attraction, retention and culture.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers potential risks related to the\neffectiveness of the Board, including succession planning for the Board, our overall governance and\nBoard structure and matters related to environmental and social issues.\nThe Innovation and Technology Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating\nto technical and market risks associated with product development and investment, sourcing strategy,\nas well as risk mitigation policies and procedures relating to products based on new technology or\nsignificant innovations to existing technology.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Board has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all directors and employees entitled the \u201cWorldwide\nStandards of Business Conduct,\u201d which is designed to help directors and employees resolve ethical issues\nencountered in the business environment. The Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct covers topics such\nas conflicts of interest, compliance with laws (including anti-corruption laws), fair dealing, protecting our\nproperty and confidentiality of our information and encourages the reporting of any behavior not in\naccordance with the Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct.\nThe Board has also adopted a \u201cCode of Ethics\u201d for our executive officers and all other senior finance\nexecutives. The Code of Ethics covers topics such as financial reporting, conflicts of interest and compliance\nwith laws, rules, regulations and our policies.\n206 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMeetings and Committees of the Board\nThe table below shows the current chairs and membership of the Board and each standing Board committee,\nthe independence status of each director and the number of Board and Board committee meetings held during\nfiscal 2020.\nDirector\nBoard of \nDirectors\nAudit and \nFinance \nCommittee\nNominating\nand \nCorporate \nGovernance\nCommittee\nCompensation\nand\nLeadership \nResources \nCommittee\nInnovation\nand \nTechnology\nCommittee\nJohn E.

In addition, on at least an annual basis, the Board and\nmanagement discuss our strategic direction, new business opportunities and product roadmap. Independent\nand non-management directors also meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions without our Chief\nExecutive Officer and other members of senior management. In addition to these formal meetings, members of\nthe Board informally interact with senior management (including our Chief Executive Officer), industry leaders\nand customers on a periodic basis. In 2020, sessions of only our non-employee directors were held five times.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has four standing committees: an Audit and Finance Committee, a Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee, a Compensation Committee and an Innovation and Technology Committee. The\nmembers of the Board committees and their Chairs are nominated by the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee and appointed by the Board.\nEach of the Board committees has adopted a written charter, which has been approved by the Board. You can\naccess our current bylaws, committee charters, the Governance Principles, the Worldwide Standards of\nBusiness Conduct and the Code of Ethics on the Investor Relations pages of our website at www.amd.com or\nir.amd.com.\nAudit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board with its oversight\nresponsibilities regarding the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, risk assessment, the performance of our internal audit function, our financial affairs and policies\nand the nature and structure of major financial commitments. The Audit and Finance Committee is also directly\nresponsible for the appointment, independence, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our\n207 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nindependent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit and Finance Committee.\nThe Audit and Finance Committee meets alone with our senior management, our financial, legal and internal\naudit personnel and with our independent registered public accounting firm, which has free access to the\nAudit and Finance Committee. The head of our Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Chair of the\nAudit and Finance Committee and \u201cdotted-line\u201d to our Chief Financial Officer and serves a staff function for\nthe Audit and Finance Committee.

The Board also determined that Mr. Householder is an\n\u201caudit committee financial expert,\u201d as defined under applicable SEC rules. The Audit and Finance Committee\nheld nine meetings during 2020.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nassists the Board in its responsibilities regarding the identification of qualified candidates to become Board\nmembers, the selection of nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or\nspecial meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected), the selection of candidates to fill any\nvacancies on the Board and the development and recommendation to the Board of corporate governance\nguidelines and principles, including the Governance Principles, as well as matters related to environmental and\nsocial issues (\u201cESG\u201d), practices and reporting. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee oversees the Board\u2019s annual review of its performance (including its composition and organization)\nand leads a process for our non-employee directors to evaluate the performance of our Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retains a search firm for the purpose of obtaining\ninformation regarding potential candidates for Board membership. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee currently consists of Mr. Caldwell, as Chair, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan, Gregoire,\nHouseholder, Marren and Talwalkar, each determined by the Board to be \u201cindependent\u201d under applicable SEC\nand Nasdaq rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings during 2020.\nIn evaluating candidates to determine if they are qualified to become Board members, the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee looks principally for the following attributes: personal and professional\ncharacter, integrity, ethics and values\u037e diversity and inclusion\u037e general business experience and leadership\nprofile, including experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a\npublicly held company\u037e strategic planning abilities and experience\u037e aptitude in accounting and finance\u037e\nexpertise in domestic and international markets\u037e experience in our industry and with relevant social policy\nconcerns\u037e understanding of relevant technologies\u037e expertise in an area of our operations\u037e communication and\ninterpersonal skills\u037e and practical and mature business judgment.

Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee uses these and other criteria to evaluate potential nominees, there are no stated minimum criteria\nfor nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the same standards to evaluate all\ndirector candidates, regardless of who proposes them.\nCompensation and Leadership Resources Committee. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in its\nresponsibilities relating to the compensation of all Section 16 officers, members of the Board and such other\nemployees as delegated from time to time by the Board. In consultation with management, the Board and the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee designs, recommends to\nthe Board for approval and evaluates our compensation plans, policies and programs. In addition, the\nCompensation Committee provides guidance on our talent management and development programs, including\nbut not limited to those regarding talent acquisition, retention, talent development, succession planning,\ncareer progression, culture, diversity and inclusion.

The Compensation Committee annually reviews our non-\nemployee directors\u2019 compensation. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee recommends any\nchanges to our non-employee directors\u2019 compensation to the Board for approval. In addition, the Board and\nCompensation Committee periodically evaluate how our director pay levels and pay policies compare to the\ncompetitive market. In 2020, the Board and Compensation Committee reviewed competitive market data\nregarding non-employee directors\u2019 pay relative to our peer group (as described in more detail in\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d) as well as the broader market which was compiled by Compensia,\nthe independent compensation consultant of our Compensation Committee. While competitive market data is\nimportant to the evaluation of the directors\u2019 compensation, such data is just one of several factors considered\nby the Board in approving director compensation, and the Board has discretion in determining the nature and\nextent of its use. In 2020, in addition to the competitive market data, the Board considered the amount of time\nassociated with Board and Board committee services as well as annual share usage under our 2004 Equity\nIncentive Plan (as amended and restated, the \u201c2004 Plan\u201d) related to non-employee director compensation.\nThe Board continued the practice adopted in May 2014, to reallocate the mix of cash and equity compensation\npaid to our non-employee directors, with the goal of maintaining total average compensation per non-\nemployee director at approximately the same level as had been previously paid and maintaining an affordable\nannual share usage. These changes are further described under \u201cCash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors\u201d\nand \u201cEquity Awards for Non-Employee Directors\u201d below.\nCash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors. The cash fees our non-employee directors were eligible to\nreceive in fiscal 2020 was composed of the following elements:\nAnnual retainer for services as a director\u037e\nAnnual retainer for services on a Board committee\u037e and\nAnnual retainer for services as a Board committee chair.\nAnnual Retainer for Service as Director.Non-employee directors are paid an annual retainer for their service as\ndirectors. In 2020, other than our Chairman of the Board, the non-employee directors were paid an annual\nretainer of $75,000. The annual retainer for the Chairman of the Board for a full year of service is 1.5 times the\namount of the other Board members annual retainer, or $112,500.\n211 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnual Retainer for Service on Board Committees. During 2020, the Board continued the practice of paying\nadditional annual retainers set forth below for service on a Board committee. These retainers were unchanged\nin 2020 from 2019.\nAudit and Finance Committee\n$20,000\nCompensation Committee\n$20,000\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n$10,000\nInnovation and Technology Committee\n$20,000\nAnnual Retainer for Service as Board Committee Chair. In addition, non-employee directors receive annual\nretainers for serving as a chair of a Board committee, which are set forth below. These retainers were\nunchanged in 2020 from 2019.\nAudit and Finance Committee\n$25,000\nCompensation Committee\n$15,000\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n$10,000\nInnovation and Technology Committee\n$15,000\nEquity Awards for Non-Employee Directors. In order to align the long-term interests of our directors with\nthose of our stockholders, a portion of director compensation is provided in the form of equity. Non-employee\ndirectors participate in the 2004 Plan and are entitled to receive equity awards under our Outside Director\nEquity Compensation Policy, subject to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Non-employee directors are generally\neligible to receive an annual RSU award (an \u201cAnnual RSU Award\u201d) upon re-election at each annual meeting of\nstockholders, and, if a non-employee director is appointed to the Board on a date other than the date of an\nannual meeting of stockholders, such director is entitled to receive an initial RSU award on his or her\nappointment to the Board (an \u201cOff-Cycle RSU Grant\u201d).\nAnnual RSU Awards. Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, which was amended in\nFebruary 2020, the Annual RSU Award for each non-employee director (other than the Chairman of the Board)\nwho has served on the Board continuously prior to an annual meeting of stockholders is calculated based on\nthe following formula, with no discretionary component: the quotient of (i) $205,000 (the \u201cTarget Equity\nValue\u201d) divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading day period preceding\nand ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. The Chairman of the Board\u2019s Annual RSU Award is 1.5x\nthe Target Equity Value.\nIn addition, under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, if a non-employee director has\nserved on the Board for less than twelve months prior to an annual meeting of stockholders, such director\u2019s\nAnnual RSU Award is pro-rated based on the number of months of service before the respective annual\nmeeting of stockholders. For purposes of the pro rata calculation, service during any portion of a month\ncounts as a full month of service.\nOff-Cycle Grants. Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, an Off-Cycle Grant is equal\nto the quotient of (i) the Target Equity Value divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for\nthe 30-trading day period preceding and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. The Annual RSU\nAwards and the Off-Cycle RSU Grants vest on the one-year anniversary of their grant dates.\nIn 2020, each of our directors received an Annual RSU Award under our current Outside Director Equity\nCompensation Policy.\n212 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDeferral. Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors may elect\nto defer the issuance of shares of our common stock that become issuable upon vesting of the RSUs granted\npursuant to the 2004 Plan (and the recognition of taxable income associated with such RSUs) until such time\nas the director ceases to serve on the Board. A non-employee director can make this election by completing a\nRestricted Stock Unit Award Deferral Election Agreement before the scheduled date of an RSU grant. If a\ndirector makes this election, the issuance of the common stock subject to the RSUs may not be accelerated or\nchanged once the Election Agreement is submitted to us. Any common stock deferred under our Outside\nDirector Equity Compensation Policy is issued to the director, in one lump sum, within 30 days after his or her\nresignation from the Board.\nAcceleration of Vesting. Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, in the event of our\nchange of control, all of our non-employee directors\u2019 equity compensation awards will become fully vested. In\naddition, in the event of the termination of a non-employee director\u2019s service to the Board as a result of death,\ndisability or retirement, all of his or her equity compensation awards will become fully vested\u037e provided that,\nsuch non-employee director served as a member of the Board for at least three years prior to the date of\ntermination and satisfied our stock ownership guideline requirements during his or her service as a Board\nmember.\nOther Benefits for Non-Employee Directors. We reimburse our directors for their travel and expenses in\nconnection with attending Board meetings and Board-related activities, such as AMD site visits and\nsponsored events, as well as for continuing education programs.\nStock Ownership Guidelines. Under our stock ownership guidelines, which were updated in August 2020, our\nnon-employee directors are required to hold the lesser of (i) the number of shares equivalent to five times their\nthen-current annual retainer divided by the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-day period\nimmediately preceding and ending with the date of the annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) 30,000 shares (in\nthe case of non-employee directors other than the Chairman of the Board) or 45,000 shares (in the case of the\nChairman of the Board).\nThe stock ownership guidelines must be achieved by each non-employee director within the later of (i) August\n2022 or (ii) the five-year anniversary of the respective director\u2019s first election or appointment to the Board or\nfirst appointment as Chairman of the Board, as applicable.\nUntil the requirements of our stock ownership guidelines are achieved, each non-employee director is\nencouraged to retain at least 10% of the \u201cnet shares\u201d  (as defined below) obtained through our stock incentive\nplans.

The definitive proxy statement for\nAMD\u2019s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders may include additional information related to the topics\ndiscussed below.

This \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d describes our executive\ncompensation philosophy and objectives, provides an overview of our executive compensation program and\nreviews compensation decisions for the following executive officers (our \u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d) for the\n2020 fiscal year:\nName\nTitle\nLisa Su\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nDevinder Kumar\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nRick Bergman\nExecutive Vice President, Computing and Graphics Business Group\nDarren Grasby\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Sales Officer\nMark Papermaster\nChief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President, Technology\nand Engineering\nMr. Kumar was promoted to Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective\nJanuary 4, 2021. Prior to that promotion, Mr. Kumar served as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial\nOfficer and Treasurer.\nMr. Grasby was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Sales Officer effective January 4, 2021.\nPrior to that promotion, Mr. Grasby served as our Senior Vice President and Chief Sales Officer.\nExecutive Summary\n2020 Business Highlights\n2020 marked an inflection point in our long-term journey as we made significant progress establishing AMD as\nthe high-performance computing leader, while setting a new record for annual revenue. We significantly\naccelerated our business and exceeded our aggressive growth goals for the year while navigating industry-\nwide challenges caused by COVID-19. We built substantial momentum throughout the year as we successfully\nramped volume production of more than twenty 7nm PC, gaming, and data center products.\nWe made great progress across our businesses in 2020 as we gained market share with our 7nm Ryzen\n and\nEPYC\n processors. For the year, record annual client processor revenue grew by more than 50% as AMD\nRyzen processor demand increased. Adoption of EPYC processors across cloud, enterprise and HPC\ncustomers also accelerated significantly in 2020. We set a new all-time record for annual server processor\nrevenue. Server processor sales more than doubled year-over-year, and our overall data center sales are now a\nhigh teens percentage of our total annual revenue. Strong demand for our 7nm products powered by our \u201cZen\n3\u201d processor core increased AMD\u2019 momentum across the PC, Gaming and data center markets\nOur financial results in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 were strong as we delivered record annual revenue,\nhigher gross margins, and a significant growth in profitability. In 2020, we grew revenue by 45% year-over-\nyear to $9.76 billion and increased our gross margin to 45% compared to 43% in the prior year, which marked\nour highest gross margin since 2011. We increased our operating income to $1.37 billion compared to $631\nmillion for fiscal 2019 and improved our net income to $2.49 billion, including a $1.30 billion income tax benefit\n214 \n(1)\n(2)\nTM\nTM\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nassociated with a valuation allowance release, compared to $341 million in the prior year. We also made\nsignificant progress strengthening our balance sheet as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments totaled $2.29 billion, up from $1.50 billion in the prior year.\nDriven by superior operational and financial performance, we were the seventh highest performing stock in the\nS&P 500 with annual growth of 100%, following growth of 143% in 2019 and 80% in 2018. From the end of\nfiscal 2015 to the end of fiscal 2020, our market capitalization appreciated, generating approximately $109\nbillion in value for our stockholders. The following graphic compares the change in our market capitalization\nto the change in the S&P 500 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (\u201cSOX\u201d) from the end of fiscal\n2015 through the end of fiscal 2020:\n2020 Executive Compensation Program\u202f-\u202fHighlights\nWe operate in a challenging, highly competitive and rapidly evolving global business environment. To\ncompete effectively in this environment, our Compensation Committee has implemented an executive\ncompensation program that is designed to: emphasize \u201cpay for performance\u201d\u037e advance our business strategies\nand objectives\u037e drive the creation of long-term sustainable stockholder value\u037e and attract, retain and motivate\nhigh-caliber senior leadership. Accordingly, our 2020 executive compensation program:\nProvides our Named Executive Officers with target total direct compensation that is competitive with\nthe market\u037e\nRewards our Named Executive Officers for superior financial and operational results through our\nExecutive Incentive Plan (our \u201cEIP\u201d), a short-term cash incentive program that puts a substantial\ncomponent of pay at risk, with payouts tied to achievement of carefully selected and calibrated\nfinancial performance objectives and strategic milestones\u037e and\nAligns our Named Executive Officers\u2019 interests with those of our stockholders through long-term\nequity-based awards, including performance-based restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d) tied to above-\nmarket stock price performance.\nConsistent with the forgoing, the compensation payable to our Named Executive Officers for 2020 was\nprimarily driven by achievement of the financial performance objectives and strategic milestones under our EIP\nand our stock price performance.\n2020 Executive Compensation Program\u202f-\u202fEmphasis on \u201cPay for Performance\u201d\nAs the tables below illustrate, the target total direct compensation (defined below) delivered to our Named\nExecutive Officers in 2020 was weighted heavily towards performance-based compensation:\nApproximately 94% of our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s target total direct compensation and\napproximately 86% of the average target total direct compensation of our other Named Executive\nOfficers was delivered in the form of variable or \u201cat risk\u201d compensation tied to Company, individual,\nor stock price performance\u037e\n215 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLong-term equity awards (the ultimate value of which depend on our stock price) continued to be the\nlargest element of compensation, representing approximately 83% of our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s\ntarget total direct compensation and approximately 72% of the average target total direct\ncompensation of our other Named Executive Officers\u037e and\n100% of the target annual incentive bonuses payable to our Named Executive Officers was tied to the\nachievement of pre-established financial goals for the 2020 fiscal year that align with our annual\noperating plan and strategic milestones.\nAs used herein, a Named Executive Officer\u2019s \u201ctarget total direct compensation\u201d is the sum of his or her base\nsalary, target annual incentive bonus opportunity under our EIP and the aggregate intended target value of\nlong- term equity awards granted under our 2004 Plan in the 2020 fiscal year. The aggregate intended target\nvalues of our long-term equity awards, excluding the non-recurring retention equity award for Mr. Grasby (see\n\u201cRetention Equity Award\u202f-\u202fDarren Grasby\u201d below), differ from the accounting values (grant date fair value)\nthat are included in the \u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table\u201d and \u201cGrants of Plan-Based Awards in 2020\u201d table\nbelow.\n2020 Realized Pay Driven by Financial and Operational Results and Stock Price Performance\nThe total compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as reported in the 2020 Summary Compensation\nTable, reflects the accounting values (grant date fair value) of their annual long-term equity awards and not\nthe economic value actually realized by our Named Executive Officers from these awards. Since a significant\nportion of the reported compensation of our Named Executive Officers represents potential future\ncompensation, we believe it is useful to supplement the information provided in the 2020 Summary\nCompensation Table with a discussion of the pay our Named Executive Officers actually realized during the\nfiscal year.\nThe table below compares our market capitalization to the \u201crealized pay\u201d of our Chief Executive Officer and the\naverage \u201crealized pay\u201d of our other Named Executive Officers for each of our last three fiscal years. As this\ntable demonstrates, the compensation collectively \u201crealized\u201d by our Named Executive Officers in the aggregate\nfrom\n216 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe end of fiscal 2018 to the end of fiscal 2020 represented 0.28% of the $101.2 billion in value created for our\nstockholders during that same period.\nEach Named Executive Officer\u2019s \u201crealized pay\u201d is the sum of his or her earned base salary, actual annual\nincentive bonus under the EIP, any discretionary or retention bonus amounts realized, other\ncompensation, and Form W-2 income realized due to stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted\nstock unit and performance-based awards under our equity plans for the applicable fiscal year. Additional\ninformation is provided below in the \u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table\u201d and the \u201cOption Exercises and\nStock Vested in 2020\u201d table. Realized pay is not a substitute for total compensation. For more information\non total compensation as calculated under SEC rules, see the notes accompanying the 2020 Summary\nCompensation Table below.\nThe fiscal 2018 average of the Other Named Executive Officers exclude Messrs. Bergman and Grasby, who\nwere not Named Executive Officers during those years. The fiscal 2019 average of the Other Named\nExecutive Officers excludes Mr. Bergman, who joined us on August 5, 2019.\nThe AMD Market Capitalization amounts are as of the last day of each applicable fiscal year.\nThe realized pay of our Named Executive Officers in 2020 was primarily attributable to (i) the growth in AMD\nstock price and the vesting of long-term equity awards and exercise of stock options that were granted in prior\nyears, (ii) payout vs. target amounts for PRSUs and (iii) their annual incentive bonuses under the EIP. The EIP\npayout in 2020 was 142% of target compared to 74.6% of target in 2019 and 86% of target in 2018, resulting in\nan average payout under the EIP for the previous three fiscal years of 100.9% of target. For a discussion of the\nEIP, see \u201c2020 Compensation Elements\u202f-\u202fAnnual Incentive Bonuses\u201d below.\nResponse to 2020 \u201cSay On Pay\u201d Vote and Stockholder Engagement Process\nThe Compensation Committee seeks to align the objectives of our executive compensation program with the\ninterests of our stockholders. When evaluating our executive compensation program, the Compensation\nCommittee carefully considers both the results of our annual advisory resolution on the compensation of our\nNamed Executive Officers (the \u201csay on pay\u201d proposal) as well as direct feedback from our stockholders, with\nwhom we actively and directly engage throughout the fiscal year. After three years of consistently strong\n(90%+) stockholder support, our \u201csay on pay\u201d resolution received 66.9% (70.2% as calculated by Institutional\nShareholder Services) support at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. We believe this was primarily due\nto the multi-year PRSU awards granted to Dr. Su and Mr. Papermaster in 2019 (the \u201cValue Creation Equity\nAwards\u201d), which were intended to be one-time awards. However, as a result, during 2020 we further intensified\nour stockholder engagement regarding executive compensation and other corporate governance matters.\nOur relationship with our stockholders is an important part of our company\u2019s success and we have a long\ntradition of engaging with our stockholders and obtaining their perspectives. During 2020, our integrated\noutreach team led by our Investor Relations group and executive compensation team, met to discuss a wide\nvariety of issues with investors. We believe that our approach to engaging openly with our investors on\ntopics such as financial issues, corporate governance, diversity and inclusion, executive compensation, and\ncorporate\n217 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresponsibility drives increased corporate accountability, improves decision-making, and ultimately creates\nlong- term value. We are committed to:\nAccountability. Maintain leading corporate governance practices to ensure good oversight,\naccountability, and good decision-making.\nEngagement. Proactively engage with stockholders and stakeholder groups in dialogue on a range of\ntopics to solicit feedback and identify emerging trends and issues to inform our thinking and\napproach.\nTransparency. Maintain high levels of transparency on a range of financial and environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) matters to build trust and sustain two-way stakeholder dialogue that supports\nour business strategy and success.\nIn addition to our regular engagements, we held a series of meetings every year with many of our institutional\nstockholders focused on compensation practices, COVID-19, environmental, social and governance\ndisclosures and diversity and inclusion, among other topics. We pursue multiple avenues for stockholder\nengagement, including in-person and virtual meetings with our stockholders, participating at various\nconferences (including virtual engagement in 2020), and issuing periodic reports on our activities. Through\nthese activities, we discuss and receive input, provide additional information, and address questions on our\ncorporate strategy, executive compensation programs, corporate governance, and other topics of interest to\nour stockholders, such as our corporate responsibility activities discussed above. These engagement efforts\nwith our stockholders allow us to better understand our stockholders\u2019 priorities and perspectives, and provide\nus with useful input concerning our corporate strategy and our compensation and ESG practices. We actively\nengage with our stockholders on a year-round basis and remain active outside of proxy season. Feedback\nfrom these engagements is provided to the Board who in turn decides whether enhancements to our\ncompany\u2019s policies and practices are required to meet stockholder expectations relating to current or new\nissues or emerging trends.\nIn 2020, we engaged with over 60% of our total shares outstanding and our Directors personally engaged\nwith nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding.\nStockholder Engagement Feedback\nIn summary, stockholder feedback centered on the following themes:\nBoard Composition\nWe provide substantial disclosure around the composition of our current Board and the skill sets we\nconsider important for our directors to have as well as our process for identifying and evaluating\npotential director candidates.\nAnnually, we look at and assess the composition of the Board across a broad range of criteria\nincluding, but not limited to industry and geographic experience, skills, education, and diversity.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance Disclosures\nThe Board maintains formal oversight responsibility for our focus on corporate responsibility. Our\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for these matters with\nadditional ESG matters reviewed by other committees (e.g., the Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for oversight of human capital issues and the Audit Committee is responsible for\noversight of our corporate ethics and compliance program).\nBased on stockholder feedback, this year we have disclosed more information about ESG.\nAdditionally, our 25  anniversary Corporate Citizenship Report published in 2020 highlighted our\nprogress across various sustainability metrics.\nIn 2020, we completed multi-year sustainability goals spanning energy efficiency in products,\ngreenhouse gas reductions in our operations, and \u201cbest-in-class\u201d greenhouse gas, water and waste\nmanagement with our wafer foundry suppliers. For instance, we exceeded our award-winning AMD\n25x20 energy Efficiency goal that demonstrated a 31.7x more typical-use, energy efficiency in our\nprocessors for mobile devices since 2014 (more information is available at AMD.com/25x20).\n218 \nth\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe also surveyed and interviewed external and internal stakeholders to gather ESG feedback,\npriorities, and opportunities that are of importance and material to the company and society. We are\ncurrently assessing the feedback and expect to further develop our strategic ESG focus areas and\ngoals this year. We continue to be focused on strategic ESG issues such as product energy efficiency\nand climate, human capital management, supply chain responsibility, and the role of technology in\nsociety. We disclose hundreds of related data points in our ESG data tables and Global Reporting\nIndex (GRI), including environmental data on energy, emissions, water and waste\u037e employee-related\ndata on gender, age, well-being and community\u037e supplier responsibility data on assessments,\ntrainings and audits\u037e and more.\nExecutive Compensation\nIn the aggregate, feedback received during these discussions continued to be supportive of our\nexecutive compensation program and our compensation program design, and we received feedback\nthat AMD has a well-functioning incentive program which appropriately rewards strong long-term\nperformance.\nSome stockholders expressed concern with the Value Creation Equity Awards granted to Dr. Su and\nMr. Papermaster. As we explained in our definitive proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of\nstockholders and reiterated in many of our conversations with our stockholders, the Value Creation\nEquity Awards were intended to be one-time awards that the Compensation Committee and the non-\nmanagement members of the Board approved following their review and consideration of (i) Dr. Su\u2019s\nand Mr. Papermaster\u2019s unique and significant contributions to our success (ii) our long-term\nobjectives and strategy, (iii) the potential incentive and retention value of Dr. Su\u2019s and Mr.\nPapermaster\u2019s then- outstanding equity holdings, and (iv) the highly competitive marketplace for\nexecutive talent. Under their leadership, AMD has performed exceptionally well from an operational,\nfinancial and stockholder return perspective. Since Dr. Su\u2019s promotion to Chief Executive Officer in\n2014, AMD has created over $109 billion in market capitalization for our stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee and non-management members of the Board determined the Value Creation\nEquity Awards were in the best interests of AMD and its stockholders by promoting the retention and\nfurther motivation of Dr. Su and Mr. Papermaster, whose continued focus and dedication is vitally\nimportant to our continued growth and long-term success.\nWe shared stockholder feedback with the Compensation Committee, which considers both the results\nof our say-on-pay vote as well as direct feedback from stockholders to align the objectives of our\nexecutive compensation program with the interests of our stockholders. As we evaluated our\ncompensation practices for 2020, the Compensation Committee considered the strong support we\nreceived from our stockholders for the overall design of our executive compensation program during\nour 2020 engagement as well as in the past.\nBased on stockholder feedback and considering the unique circumstances of our 2019 program, the\nCompensation Committee decided to retain the overall program design, which they believe\nemphasizes pay-for-performance and provides a competitive program that effectively retains and\nmotivates our Named Executive Officers while aligning with stockholder value creation. Based on\nstockholder feedback, no Value Creation Equity Awards were granted in 2020.\nDespite the challenging external landscape due to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our\nbusiness operations and practices as well as the global economy at large, the Compensation\nCommittee did not make any mid-year adjustments to the fiscal 2020 EIP performance targets.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe shared our commitment to diversity and inclusion and outlined our vision for stockholders this\nyear. Our Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion (\u201cDB&I\u201d) vision is that: Transforming lives through high\nperformance computing is enabled by attracting, acquiring, developing, and advancing our aim to\nhave the most engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce in the semiconductor industry. Our goal is to\ngrow and expand our global team to include as many unique, underrepresented, and minority\n219 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvoices as possible to fuel our differentiated culture, enable great products and deliver strong\nbusiness results while also advocating for diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem.\nWe believe diversity, belonging and inclusion creates better companies and increases stockholder\nreturns.\nCultivating the best and brightest semiconductor talent across the globe strengthens our high-\nperformance culture and solidifies our place as an industry leader for years to come.\nOur DB&I strategy is an extension of our existing talent strategy and winning culture, as younger\ngenerations view purposeful DB&I action as a work culture imperative, not just a \u201cnice to have.\u201d\nIn line with stockholder feedback, we developed our 3-year diversity and inclusion strategy in 2020 to\nset measurable goals to determine success in the coming years in primary focus areas of Women,\nPeople of Color, Employee Community and professional development.\nBased on stockholder feedback, we added a DB&I goal to our EIP strategic milestones for 2021.\nPandemic-Related Business Continuity\nAMD worked diligently to navigate the uncertainty of COVID-19. We continuously monitored and\nassessed the situation to take the necessary steps to maintain business continuity while protecting\nthe health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We remain committed to being a\nstrong and dependable partner.\nAMD possesses a world-class global supply chain. Over the last five years we have established a\ntrack record of excellence in execution and we are well-positioned today to continue to execute well\nthrough these unprecedented times. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we made adjustments and\nmitigated the impact on our global operations. We have stayed very close to our partners, customers\nand employees to make sure we are doing all that we can to support the evolving environment and\ntheir priorities.\nWe are proud that people are working safely and productively remotely on AMD-powered laptops,\nusing services running on AMD-powered servers, and searching for medical breakthroughs on AMD-\npowered supercomputers. We don\u2019t take this responsibility lightly.\nWe provided technology and home office stipends for employees as they eased into remote work and\nprovided PPE and testing globally. We continue to keep the health and safety of our employees, and\nthose of our partners, as the top priority. We are following guidelines from local government and\npublic health authorities around the world and implementing best practices to keep our operations\nrunning effectively.\nStockholder feedback was that AMD\u2019s actions and rapid and decisive response to COVID-19 was\nworld class and thorough.\nOur commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability\u202f-\u202fbuilt on a strong foundation of transparency,\ngovernance, and ethics\u202f-\u202fcreates value for AMD and our stockholders by helping us mitigate risks, reduce\ncosts, build brand value and identify new market opportunities. Through our technology, we enable others to\nsolve some of the world\u2019s toughest problems\u202f-\u202ffrom climate change and energy efficiency, to medical\nadvancements and positive societal change. We are proud of the results we have achieved to date\u202f-\u202fbut as we\nlook toward the next decade we know that even greater leadership will be required in the area of ESG.\nA foundational element of our approach to corporate responsibility is our commitment to transparency, and we\nregularly evaluate the effectiveness of our reporting on our ESG reporting continue to strive to keep pace with\nreporting advancements in this area including in our most recent Corporate Responsibility Report.\nThe Board recommends that stockholders initiate communications with the Board, the Chairman, or any Board\ncommittee by writing to our Corporate Secretary at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 2485 Augustine Drive,\nSanta Clara, California 95054 or by email to Corporate.Secretary@amd.com. This process assists the Board in\nreviewing and responding to stockholder communications. The Board has instructed our Corporate Secretary\nto review correspondence directed to the Board and, at the Corporate Secretary\u2019s discretion, to forward items\nthat seem to be appropriate for the Board\u2019s consideration.\n220 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExecutive Compensation Policies and Practices\nWe implement sound executive compensation policies and practices, which we believe drive superior\nperformance and prohibit or minimize behaviors that we believe do not serve our stockholders\u2019 long-term\ninterests, as highlighted in the below table:\nPolicy/Practice\nSummary\nClaw-back/Recovery Rights\nWe have the right to claw-back incentive-based and other compensation\n(including equity awards) paid or granted to an employee (including any\nNamed Executive Officer) in the event of certain misconduct by the\nemployee.\nOne-year minimum vesting\nperiod for equity awards\nOur 2004 Plan requires a minimum one-year vesting period, subject to\nlimited exceptions such as death, disability, termination of employment or a\nchange in control of AMD.\nChange in control payments are\n\u201cdouble- trigger\u201d and capped\nOur change in control agreements are \u201cdouble-trigger,\u201d meaning payments\nwill be made only if there is an involuntary termination of employment\nwithout cause or constructive discharge following a change in control.\nFurther, since March 2010 we have not and will not enter into change in\ncontrol agreements that provide cash change in control payments that\nexceed (i) two times the sum of base salary and target annual incentive\nbonus plus (ii) the pro-rated target annual incentive bonus for the year in\nwhich the termination of employment occurs.\nNo new excise tax gross- ups\nSince April 2009, we have not and will not enter into any change in control\nagreement or arrangement with a Named Executive Officer that provides for\nan excise tax gross-up payment.\nLimited perquisites\nWe provide limited perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named\nExecutive Officers and provide air and other travel for our Named Executive\nOfficers for business purposes only.\nAnti-hedging and pledging policy\nWe prohibit our employees (including our Named Executive Officers and\nDirectors) from hedging AMD securities. Pledging of AMD securities is not\npermitted without the preapproval of the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, which is only granted in very limited circumstances. None of\nour Named Executive Officers or Directors currently have pledged any\nshares.\nIncentive compensation amounts\nare subject to payment thresholds\nand maximums\nOur annual cash performance bonuses and 2020 annual PRSU awards have\nthreshold performance requirements that must be achieved to receive\npayment and are subject to maximum potential payment \u201ccaps.\u201d\nStock ownership requirements\nWe have robust stock ownership requirements for our Chief Executive\nOfficer and other Named Executive Officers.\nCompensation risk assessment\nThe Compensation Committee conducts an annual risk assessment of our\ncompensation policies and practices to ensure that our programs are not\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.\nTalent Management Focus\nDeveloping, motivating, retaining, and attracting talent is critical to guide and execute our strategy as well as\nto continue to grow our business. This is a strong focus of our executive compensation program and the\nCompensation Committee. Our executive compensation program aligns with our talent objectives and our\n221 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompensation decisions not only consider individual and company performance, but also long-term potential,\nkey retention needs and organizational succession plans.\nOne of the Compensation Committee\u2019s responsibilities described in its charter is to regularly review\nsuccession planning and talent development. The Compensation Committee at least annually reviews\nsuccession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executive positions. These reviews occur\nwith input from the Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Human\nResources and Investor Relations and our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The\nCompensation Committee also reviews succession plans in executive session, with no members of\nmanagement present. Succession planning for key executive roles consists of an assessment of internal\ncandidates and their development plans, as well as potential external talent, while factoring in our culture and\nan emphasis on diversity and inclusion.\nWe believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and\nincreasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes AMD stronger. We are focused on hiring\nand developing under-represented minorities and women leaders. We are proud to be led by a highly regarded\nChief Executive Officer who has earned many esteemed awards for her business and technical prowess. In\n2020, Dr. Su received the semiconductor industry\u2019s highest honor as the 2020 recipient of the Robert N. Noyce\nAward. Dr. Su also ranked #2 on Fortune\u2019s Businessperson of the Year list for her strategic vision and\nsuccessful company turnaround.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nPay for Performance\nOur executive compensation program philosophy centers on pay for performance and is guided by the\nfollowing primary principles:\nPrinciple\nDescription\nBusiness Driven\nCompensation should be aligned to performance. Rewards should be\ndirectly tied to the achievement of specific financial, operational and\nstrategic objectives that generally lead to increased and sustained\nstockholder value.\nPerformance Differentiated\nCompensation should be structured to create an effective link between pay\nand performance at both the company and individual level. With improved\ncompany performance and increases in company valuation and stock price,\nour compensation programs should deliver higher rewards to our Named\nExecutive Officers.\nMarket Competitive\nCompensation should be competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-\ncaliber senior leadership.\nOwnership Oriented\nCompensation should be fully aligned with stockholder interests by\ndelivering meaningful equity awards tied to and balanced with stockholder\nvalue creation and by maintaining robust stock ownership requirements.\nWe continually assess and adjust our executive compensation program, policies and practices taking into\naccount these guiding principles and based on feedback obtained through our stockholder engagement\nefforts.\nCompetitive Compensation\nWe operate in a highly competitive business environment\u037e therefore, it is imperative that we recruit and retain\ntop leadership and industry experts to guide and execute our business strategy. This requires that we offer\ncompetitive compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee seeks to compensate our Named\nExecutive Officers at competitive levels with compensation for executives in similar positions at a group of\npeer companies (set forth below), which the Compensation Committee believes reflects the current competitive\nmarket for executive talent. In making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also considers\na\n222 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnumber of other factors, including the scope of responsibility of each Named Executive Officer, internal pay\ncomparisons and the retention value of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s unvested long-term equity award\nholdings, as well as its assessment of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s performance and expected future\ncontributions and impact on the organization.\nGenerally, the Compensation Committee seeks to position each Named Executive Officer\u2019s target total direct\ncompensation between the 50th and 75th percentile of the competitive market (the \u201cTarget Positioning\u201d). A\nNamed Executive Officer\u2019s target total direct compensation may vary from the Target Positioning depending\non the other factors. The compensation realized by a Named Executive Officer will reach the Target Positioning\nonly if applicable performance targets are achieved and our stock price matches index performance and does\nnot decline. However, if performance targets are exceeded and our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) surpasses\nthe benchmark index, then the compensation realized by the Named Executive Officer could be substantially\ngreater than the Target Positioning. For 2020, the actual total target direct compensation was generally\nconsistent with our Target Positioning and the realized compensation was higher because of Company and\nstock price performance.\nAlign Pay Practices with Sound Risk Management\nThe Compensation Committee seeks to structure our executive compensation program to motivate and reward\nour Named Executive Officers for appropriately balancing opportunity and risk, such as investment in key\ninitiatives designed to advance our growth in existing and new markets while at the same time avoiding pay\npractices that encourage excessive risk-taking.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program fosters our objectives while\nmitigating potentially excessive risk-taking through the following means:\nSound Risk Management\n\u2713\nCompensation is an appropriate balance of \u201cfixed\u201d pay versus \u201cvariable\u201d pay, as well as\n\u201cshort-term\u201d versus \u201clong-term\u201d incentives\n\u2713\nPerformance-based compensation opportunities are capped\n\u2713\nOur annual incentive plans include multiple Company-wide financial measures that are\nquantitative and measurable\n\u2713\nLong-term equity awards are a balanced mix of time-based and performance-based vesting,\nboth spanning multiple years\n\u2713\nLong-term equity awards generally have a minimum vesting period of one year\n\u2713\nCompensation is subject to recoupment (\u201cclaw-back\u201d) policies and provisions\n\u2713\nOur Named Executive Officers are subject to stock ownership requirements\nHow We Make Compensation Decisions\nRole of the Compensation Committee and the Board\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible to the Board for developing and overseeing our executive\ncompensation and benefits policies and programs. The Compensation Committee, which consists of three\nindependent directors, is responsible for reviewing our executive compensation program annually to evaluate\nits alignment with the strategies and needs of our business, market trends and the interests of our\nstockholders. The Compensation Committee is responsible for formulating compensation recommendations to\nthe nonmanagement members of the Board regarding our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation and for\napproving the compensation of our other Named Executive Officers. This includes:\nreviewing and approving the performance goals and objectives that relate to performance-based\ncompensation awarded under the EIP and the 2004 Plan\u037e\nconducting an annual compensation risk assessment to evaluate our compensation policies and\npractices\u037e\n223 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nevaluating the competitiveness of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s total compensation package\u037e and\nreviewing and approving any changes to a Named Executive Officer\u2019s total compensation package,\nsuch as base salary, annual incentive bonus opportunities, annual long-term incentive award\nopportunities, and payouts and retention programs.\nThe Compensation Committee is supported by our Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to her own\ncompensation) and other members of management. The Compensation Committee considers the input of these\nindividuals to formulate the specific plan and award designs, including performance measures and\nperformance levels, necessary to align our executive compensation program with our business objectives and\nstrategies. These individuals did not attend either executive sessions or portions of any meetings of the\nCompensation Committee or the Board where their own compensation determinations were made.\nThe non-management members of the Board annually conduct a performance assessment of our Chief\nExecutive Officer. The Compensation Committee reviews and considers this performance assessment in making\nits recommendations to the non-management members of the Board regarding the compensation and other\nterms of our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s employment. Our Chief Executive Officer does not participate in the\ndetermination of her own compensation and no management recommendation is made regarding her\ncompensation.\nRole of Compensation Consultant\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist in carrying out its\nresponsibilities. During 2020, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, a national compensation\nconsulting firm, as its compensation consultant to provide assistance on executive and director compensation\nmatters. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on a variety of compensation-related matters,\nincluding:\nthe competitiveness of our executive compensation program by providing a market review of\nexecutive compensation, evaluating our compensation peer group composition and analyzing the\ncompensation at our compensation peer group companies\u037e\nthe pay levels of our Named Executive Officers by assessing and advising on equity and cash\ncompensation guidelines for various executive job levels and assessing compensation levels for our\nexecutive officers\u037e\nour executive compensation program design, including short-term and long-term incentive plan\ndesign and pay mix, the framework for our long-term equity awards and our retention strategies,\nevaluation of our stock ownership guidelines, and assessment of severance and change of control\narrangements\u037e and\nthe compensation arrangements for the non-management members of the Board.\nConflict of Interest Assessment for Compensation Consultant\nThe Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of receiving objective advice from its compensation\nconsultant and conducts an annual conflicts of interest assessment of its compensation consultant. In 2020,\nCompensia did not provide any services to or receive any payments from us, except in its capacity as a\nconsultant to the Compensation Committee. In March 2020, the Compensation Committee considered whether\nthe services provided by Compensia raised any conflicts of interest pursuant to the rules of the SEC and the\nlisting rules of Nasdaq and concluded that the work performed by Compensia did not raise any conflicts of\ninterest. The Compensation Committee expects to update its consideration of this topic in March 2021, and its\nconclusions will be included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn the course of its engagement, Compensia attended meetings of the Compensation Committee and, where\napplicable, presented its findings and recommendations for discussion. Compensia also consulted frequently\nwith members of the Compensation Committee and met with members of senior management to obtain and\nvalidate market data, review materials, and discuss management\u2019s compensation recommendations.\n224 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRole of the Chief Executive Officer\nGenerally, during the Compensation Committee\u2019s annual review of executive compensation, our Chief\nExecutive Officer reviews with the Compensation Committee her performance evaluations of each of our other\nNamed Executive Officers and her compensation recommendations for those Named Executive Officers. The\nCompensation Committee considers these recommendations in its decision process.\nCompetitive Pay Analysis\nEach year, the Compensation Committee reviews the compensation decisions of a custom group of peer\ncompanies in combination with industry-specific compensation survey data to develop an understanding of\nthe \u201ccompetitive market\u201d with respect to current executive compensation levels and related policies and\npractices. The Compensation Committee then evaluates how our pay practices and our Named Executive\nOfficers\u2019 compensation levels compared to the competitive market. As part of this evaluation, the\nCompensation Committee also reviews the performance measures and related performance target levels\ngenerally used within the competitive market to reward performance. The Compensation Committee believes\nthat it appropriately sets the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, while taking into account the\npractices of our peers and industry best practices.\nMethodology Used to Perform the Competitive Pay Analysis\nTo assist the Compensation Committee in its review of the 2020 compensation for our Named Executive\nOfficers, Compensia provided a competitive pay analysis in February 2020, which set forth compensation data\ndeveloped from publicly available information (as of November 2019) of the companies included in a custom\npeer group (the \u201c2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group\u201d). In May 2020, Compensia provided the\nCompensation Committee an update to this competitive pay analysis that reflected, in relevant part, (a) AMD\nand peer stock price and financial data as of April 17, 2020 and (b) the February 25, 2020 retention equity\naward to Mr. Grasby.\nTo develop the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group, the Compensation Committee reviewed the group of\ncompanies comprising the then-existing compensation peer group in November 2019, with particular reference\nto their industry (i.e., business segment), revenues (generally 50% to 200% of our revenues for the trailing\nfour fiscal quarters) and market capitalization (generally 30% to 300% of our market capitalization), in each\ncase based on publicly available information as of November 4, 2019. The Compensation Committee selected\nthese two metrics because, based on Compensia\u2019s analysis and holding all other factors constant, revenue has\nthe greatest correlation to cash compensation levels and market capitalization has the greatest influence on\nequity compensation levels.\nBased on this review, the Compensation Committee removed ON Semiconductor Corp. because its market\ncapitalization was less than 30% of our market capitalization, and Symantec Corporation because it was\nundergoing major business changes and completed the sale of its enterprise security assets on November 4,\n2019. Also based on this review, and in order to improve the statistical sampling of the peer group, the\nCompensation Committee added Micron Technology, Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., each of which fit within the\napplicable criteria for industry and market capitalization. Although Micron Technology, Inc. and Qualcomm\nInc. each have revenues that exceed 200% of our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters, the\nCompensation Committee determined it was appropriate to include them in our 2020 Executive Compensation\nPeer Group given the limited alternatives. Our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters ending December\n28, 2019, would have placed us in approximately the 38th percentile of the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer\nGroup based on publicly available information. The Compensation Committee believes that the composition of\nthe 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group reflects an appropriate set of comparator companies for\npurposes of assessing our executive compensation program.\nThe Compensation Committee used the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group competitive pay analysis\ndeveloped by Compensia as its reference source in analyzing the competitiveness of our Named Executive\nOfficers\u2019 compensation. As compared to the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group, AMD\u2019s fiscal 2020 and\nfiscal 2019 annual revenue was approximately $9.76 billion and $6.73 billion, respectively.\n225 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe companies comprising the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group are as follows:\nCompany Name\nRevenue\n($MM)\nQualcomm Inc.\n$25,258\nMicron Technology, Inc.\n$23,406\nBroadcom Inc.\n$22,265\nApplied Materials, Inc.\n$15,161\nTexas Instruments Incorporated\n$14,750\nNVIDIA Corporation\n$10,185\nSeagate Technology plc\n$ 9,977\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc.\n$ 9,690\nVMware, Inc.\n$ 9,496\nLam Research Corporation\n$ 9,489\nMotorola Solutions, Inc.\n$ 7,765\nAnalog Devices, Inc.\n$ 6,060\nNetApp, Inc.\n$ 5,908\nMicrochip Technology Incorporated\n$ 5,460\nKLA-Tencor Corporation\n$ 4,889\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\n$ 4,418\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc.\n$ 3,558\nXilinx, Inc.\n$ 3,311\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\n$ 2,915\nTable includes source data compiled by Compensia from publicly available financial reports.

These bonuses are designed to reward short-term performance and the\nachievement of the principal goals of our annual operating plan.\nUnder the fiscal 2020 EIP, the amount of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s annual cash performance bonus was\ncalculated based on (i) his or her target annual cash performance bonus opportunity, (ii) our corporate\nfinancial performance (weighted 80%) for fiscal 2020, as measured against pre-established performance levels\n(the \u201cFinancial Performance Targets\u201d) and (iii) achievement of strategic milestones (weighted 20%) established\nwith respect to new product tape outs, launches, and commercial/operational metrics (the \u201cStrategic\nMilestones\u201d). The Financial Performance Targets and the Strategic Milestones were approved by the\nCompensation Committee in February 2020. Notwithstanding achievement of the fiscal 2020 performance\ngoals, the Compensation Committee has discretion under the EIP to increase or to reduce any Named\nExecutive Officer\u2019s annual cash performance bonus.\nThe following illustrates how the 2020 annual cash performance bonuses under the EIP were calculated:\nFinancial Performance Targets\nThe Compensation Committee used the following financial performance measures and weightings as the\nFinancial Performance Targets for the fiscal 2020 EIP:\nFinancial Measure\nWeighting\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Net Income\n50\nRevenue\n25\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n25\nThe performance levels (threshold, target and maximum) for each financial performance measure were\nestablished by the Compensation Committee in February 2020, in each case in consultation with senior\n228 \n(1)\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement. The performance levels were structured to align with our fiscal 2020 financial objectives taking\ninto account overall affordability of the bonus opportunities provided under the EIP for fiscal 2020.\nThe Compensation Committee chose adjusted non-GAAP net income as a performance measure because it is a\nfair measure of our profitability and a valid metric for comparison, which the Compensation Committee\nbelieves is directly tied to enhanced stock price performance. The Compensation Committee assigned it a\nweight of 50% because it is a key short-term financial measure for the operation of our business and is a\nmeasure of significant importance to our stockholders. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP, our \u201cadjusted non-\nGAAP net income\u201d was calculated by adjusting our fiscal 2020 GAAP net income for (i) non-GAAP financial\nadjustments such as a loss on debt redemption/conversion, non-cash interest expense related to convertible\ndebt, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, provision for income taxes associated with these\nadjustments and release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and (ii) amounts accrued for fiscal 2020\nannual cash performance bonuses.\nThe Compensation Committee chose revenue as a performance measure because it reflects our top-line\ngrowth, which the Compensation Committee believes is a strong indicator of our long-term ability to increase\nprofitability, cash flow and improve stock price performance. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP, we use our\nGAAP net revenue for fiscal 2020.\nFinally, the Compensation Committee chose adjusted free cash flow as a performance measure because it\nbelieves effective cash management and cash generation are key components of our strategy and our annual\noperating plan, the successful execution of which should lower indebtedness, increase financial flexibility and\nultimately drive improved company valuation and stock price performance. For purposes of the fiscal 2020 EIP,\nour \u201cadjusted free cash flow\u201d was calculated by adjusting our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities\nfor (i) purchases of property and equipment and (ii) cash payments for fiscal 2019 bonuses which were paid in\nMarch and April 2020.\nThe following table sets forth the 2020 performance levels and comparable actual results for the EIP:\n2020 Executive Incentive Plan \nFinancial Performance Targets \n(in millions)\nFinancial Measure\n(Threshold)\n(Target)\n(Maximum)\nActual\nPerformance\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Net Income\n$\n667\n$ 1,491\n$\n2,314\n$\n1,894\nRevenue\n$\n7,000\n$ 8,500\n$\n10,000\n$\n9,763\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n$\n405\n$\n748\n$\n1,085\n$\n921\nThe threshold, target and maximum performance levels for the fiscal 2020 EIP were determined by the\nCompensation Committee using our fiscal 2020 operating plan as a benchmark and provide for appropriate\npayout above or below target. The fiscal 2020 EIP target level for each performance measure was determined\nby the Compensation Committee to be appropriately aggressive and aligned to our fiscal 2020 operating plan\nand objectives. The fiscal 2020 targets were set higher than the fiscal 2019 actual results. For each\nperformance measure, the level of performance required increases at a fixed rate between each performance\nlevel.\nStrategic Milestones\nFor the Strategic Milestones, which account for 20% of the EIP Performance Factor, the Compensation\nCommittee selected (a) new product tape outs and launches tied to specified internal targeted delivery dates\nand (b) achievement of various commercial/operations milestones relating to objectives for product yields and\nquality, inventory, brand awareness, and commercial pipeline development. Each of the specific Strategic\nMilestones is confidential, the disclosure of which would cause us competitive harm. When approved, the\nCompensation Committee believed that each Strategic Milestone was challenging, yet reasonably achievable.\nBased on our performance relative to the Financial Performance Targets and Strategic Milestones, the fiscal\n2020 EIP reached 147% achievement. Based on management\u2019s request to allocate a portion of the EIP funding\ntowards a discretionary end of year cash bonus for all employees below the level of Corporate Vice President,\nthe Compensation Committee exercised its discretion under the plan to modify achievement from 147% to\n142%. At\n229 \n(1) \n(2) \n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe end of fiscal 2020, our Chief Executive Officer assessed each Named Executive Officer\u2019s performance,\nexcept her own, and made bonus recommendations to the Compensation Committee for each of them. The\nCompensation Committee then considered the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s individual performance reviews and\nbonus recommendations, and independently assessed the company\u2019s performance and the individual\nperformance of the Chief Executive Officer and each of the other Named Executive Officers. Based on its\nassessment of each of these factors and considering the company\u2019s strong performance relative to the\nFinancial Performance Targets and Strategic Milestones, the Compensation Committee approved fiscal 2020\nannual cash performance bonuses under the EIP for the Named Executive Officers as set forth below:\n2020 EIP Bonus Calculation\nNamed Executive Officer\nEligible Base\nSalary \nDuring Fiscal\n2020\nTarget\nBonus \nOpportunity\n2020 EIP\nPerformance \nFactor\n2020 EIP\nBonus\nLisa Su\n$\n1,055,000\n170\n$\n2,546,770\nDevinder Kumar\n$\n580,000\n100\n$\n823,600\nRick Bergman\n$\n600,000\n100\n142\n$\n852,000\nDarren Grasby\n$\n555,960\n100\n$\n789,463\nMark Papermaster\n$\n625,000\n100\n$\n887,500\nThe amounts reported in this column reflect the bonus amounts approved by the Compensation\nCommittee and paid to the Named Executive Officers.\nMr. Grasby\u2019s eligible base salary during fiscal 2020 of \u00a3410,000 was converted from British pounds to U.S.\ndollars using an exchange rate of 1.356 U.S. dollars per 1.00 British pound, which was the exchange rate\nreported by Bloomberg Financial as of December 26, 2020.\nThe Compensation Committee reviews and certifies the level of achievement for each performance measure\nbefore any payments are made. This review and certification is generally performed at the first regularly\nscheduled Compensation Committee meeting following the end of the year with any payout of the annual cash\nperformance bonus occurring in March of such year.\nLong-Term Equity Awards\nWe believe that long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards provide a strong alignment\nbetween the interests of our Named Executive Officers and our stockholders. The Compensation Committee\ngenerally seeks to provide equity award opportunities that are consistent with our compensation philosophy\n(with the potential for larger payments for exceptional performance). The Compensation Committee also\nbelieves that long-term equity awards are an essential tool in promoting executive retention.\n2020 Annual Equity Awards\nIn 2020, the Compensation Committee and, in Dr. Su\u2019s case, the non-management members of the Board,\napproved the following annual equity awards under our 2004 Plan, each of which was granted to the listed\nNamed Executive Officer on August 9, 2020:\nNamed Executive Officer\nPRSUs \n(Target #\nof \nShares)\nTime-\nBased \nRSUs\nTime-Based\nStock \nOptions\nAggregate \nIntended\nTarget \nValue\nLisa Su\n109,446\n54,723\n120,642\n$ 13,845,000\nDevinder Kumar\n22,134\n11,067\n24,398\n$\n2,800,000\nRick Bergman\n21,343\n10,671\n23,527\n$\n2,700,000\nDarren Grasby\n23,715\n11,857\n26,141\n$\n3,000,000\nMark Papermaster\n28,458\n14,229\n31,369\n$\n3,600,000\nThe amounts reported in the 2020 Summary Compensation Table represent the grant date fair values (i.e.,\naccounting values) of these awards computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 718.\n230 \n(1)\n%\n%\n%\n%\n(2)\n%\n%\n(1)\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) approved the aggregate\nintended target value of each listed Named Executive Officer\u2019s 2020 annual long-term equity award.

The amounts reported in the\n2020 Summary Compensation Table represent the grant date fair values (i.e., accounting values) of the 2020\nlong-term equity awards computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718.\nIn approving the aggregate intended target value of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s 2020 annual long-term\nequity award, the Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) reviewed\ndata showing the market-competitive award levels based on the 2020 Executive Compensation Peer Group and\nthe potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s then-outstanding equity holdings.\nAdditionally, the Compensation Committee (the non-management members of the Board for Dr. Su) considered\nthe potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer\u2019s then-outstanding equity holdings, our\nexecutive retention objectives and continuity within senior management and the following high-level\ncorporate goals: achieve fiscal 2020 financial results, execute industry-leading roadmap and meet customer\ncommitments. The achievement of these high-level goals drive our overall Company business strategy and,\ncorrespondingly, the attainment of the performance objectives in our long-term incentive compensation\nprogram.\n2020 Annual PRSU Awards. The 2020 annual PRSU awards (the \u201c2020 Annual PRSUs\u201d) provide for a payout\nthat will range from 0% to 250% of the target number of shares of our common stock subject to the award (the\n\u201cTarget Shares\u201d). The actual number of shares earned by each Named Executive Officer will be calculated as\nfollows:\nEach Named Executive Officer will earn between 0% and 200% of his or her target number of shares\n(the \u201cInitial Earned Shares\u201d) depending on the return on our stock price relative to the return on the\nS&P 500 Index, in each case over the Performance Period.\nIn alignment with our long-term growth strategy, we used EPS growth as an upside modifier to the\naward. If we meet or exceed challenging pre-established non-GAAP EPS growth targets from our 2020\nto our 2022 fiscal year, award payouts will be increased to 125% or 150% of each Named Executive\nOfficer\u2019s Initial Earned Shares (if applicable, the \u201cAdjusted Earned Shares\u201d). In no event, however,\nwill the Named Executive Officer\u2019s Adjusted Earned Shares exceed 250% of his or her target number of\nshares.\nIf the return on our stock over the Performance Period is negative, then the total number of shares\nearned by each Named Executive Officer will be reduced to 50% of his or her Adjusted Earned Shares.\nIf the return on our stock price over the Performance Period is equal to or greater than 0%, then the\ntotal number of shares earned by each Named Executive Officer will be the number of his or her\nAdjusted Earned Shares.\nAny PRSUs that are earned will generally be settled on the later of August 16, 2023, or the date following the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s certification of our performance achievement. Each Named Executive Officer must\nbe continuously employed through the last day of the Performance Period to receive his or her earned shares,\nexcept to the extent an event triggers accelerated vesting of the 2020 Annual PRSUs under the terms of his or\nher employment or other agreement, as applicable.\nStock Options. Stock options are intended to align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the\ninterests of our stockholders because they will not realize any financial benefit from these awards unless our\nstock price increases above the exercise price over the seven-year option term. The stock options have an\nexercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, which was $84.85\nper share. The stock options vest (and become exercisable) as to 33 \u22153% of the underlying shares on each of\n231 \n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAugust 9, 2021, August 9, 2022 and August 9, 2023, subject to each Named Executive Officer\u2019s continued\nemployment with us through each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement\nwith us provides otherwise). The service-based vesting requirements are intended to further our retention\nobjectives. The stock options expire seven years after the grant date, subject to earlier expiration if the Named\nExecutive Officer\u2019s employment with us terminates.\nRSUs. RSUs are intended to encourage executive retention, manage share dilution, recognize individual\nperformance and align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with our stockholders because the value\nof the awards is tied to the market value of our common stock at the time of vesting. All of the RSUs granted\nto our Named Executive Officers in 2020 vest as to 33 \u22153% of the underlying shares on each of August 9, 2021,\nAugust 9, 2022 and August 9, 2023, subject to each Named Executive Officer\u2019s continued employment with us\nthrough each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement with us provides\notherwise).\nRetention Equity Award\u202f-\u202fDarren Grasby\nIn February 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of a retention equity award to Mr. Grasby\nhaving a target value of $4 million. The award was in recognition of his unique and significant contributions to\nour fiscal 2019 performance and to encourage his retention through 2023. The target value of the retention\nequity award was converted into a mix of 50% PRSUs and 50% time-based RSUs, which were granted on\nFebruary 15, 2020 under the terms of the 2004 Plan. The PRSUs have the same performance and service\nvesting conditions as the PRSUs granted on August 9, 2019 to our fiscal 2019 Named Executive Officers and\nwhich are described in detail in our definitive proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders\nfiled with the SEC on March 26, 2020. The time-based RSUs vest in three equal annual installments on each of\nthe first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.\nAccounting Considerations\nWe follow ASC Topic 718 for our share-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to\nmeasure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors,\nincluding stock options, based on the grant date \u201cfair value\u201d of these awards. This calculation is performed\nfor accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our Named Executive\nOfficers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize\nthe compensation cost of their share-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period\nthat a recipient is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, the accounting value of the 2020 Annual PRSUs and the retention PRSUs\nto Mr. Grasby were calculated by an outside professional valuation consultant using a Monte-Carlo simulation\nmodel and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted payoffs of a share-based\npayment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of aggregate\ncompensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under\nASC Topic 718, except no assumptions for forfeitures are included. The amounts reported in the 2020 Summary\nCompensation Table include the grant date fair values (i.e., accounting values) of the awards.\nGrant Timing Practices.\nWe have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around the grant\ndate of our annual long-term equity awards. Our annual long-term equity awards are typically granted in July\nor August. On occasion, we grant equity awards outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires, promotions,\nrecognition, retention or other purposes. These \u201coff cycle\u201d awards are granted only on a limited basis.\n232 \n1\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDeferred Compensation\nIn 2020, our U.S.-based Named Executive Officers were eligible to participate in our Deferred Income Account\nPlan (the \u201cDIA Plan\u201d). Participation in the DIA Plan is intended to assist our Named Executive Officers in their\nretirement planning as well as to restore Company contributions that are lost due to IRS limits applicable to\ncontributions in our Section 401(k) plan. The Compensation Committee believes the opportunity to defer\ncompensation is a competitive benefit that enhances our ability to attract and retain talented executives while\nbuilding plan participants\u2019 long-term commitment to AMD. Messrs. Kumar, Bergman and Papermaster\nparticipated in the DIA Plan in 2020. For further information about the DIA Plan, see the \u201c2020 Nonqualified\nDeferred Compensation\u201d table below.\nHealth, Welfare and Other Personal Benefits (Perquisites)\nIn 2020, a broad population of our U.S. employees, including our Named Executive Officers, were eligible to\nreceive the following health and welfare benefits:\nparticipation in our U.S. benefit programs, including our Section 401(k) plan, health care coverage,\npaid time-off and paid holidays\u037e\nmatching contributions under our Section 401(k) plan, which were equal to 75% of an employee\u2019s\nannual contribution, up to the first 6% of compensation deferred under the plan\u037e and\npatent awards, if earned.\nIn addition to the above, our Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive an annual physical examination\nand executive life insurance.\nThe health, welfare and other personal benefits described above are intended to be part of a competitive\noverall compensation program and help attract and retain executive talent.\nFor further information regarding the health, welfare, perquisites and other personal benefits received by our\nNamed Executive Officers during 2020, see the \u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table\u201d below.\nChange in Control Agreements and Arrangements\nOur Chief Executive Officer has an employment agreement that establishes her base salary and provides for\nannual incentive and long-term incentive awards under our approved plans (i.e., the EIP and 2004 Plan). In\naddition, the agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of certain termination of\nemployment scenarios, including following a change in control of AMD. For further information on this\nagreement, see \u201cSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements.\u201d\nWith the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, each of our other Named Executive Officers is party to a\nchange in control agreement with us. These agreements and the change-in-control provisions of Dr. Su\u2019s\nemployment agreement are designed to encourage the continued services of the covered Named Executive\nOfficer in the event of a potential change in control of AMD and to allow for a smooth leadership transition\nupon such a change in control. In addition, these agreements and the change-in-control provisions in Dr. Su\u2019s\nemployment agreement are intended to provide incentives to the covered Named Executive Officer to\neffectively execute the directives of the Board, even in the event that such actions may result in the\nelimination of the Named Executive Officer\u2019s position.\nIn April 2009, AMD adopted a policy to not enter into any new change in control agreements or arrangements\ncontaining an excise tax gross-up provision. Our Named Executive Officers\u2019 change in control agreements and\nthe change-in-control provisions of Dr. Su\u2019s employment agreement do not provide for excise tax gross-ups.\n233 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTermination of Employment Required to Trigger Payments\nUnder the terms and conditions of these change in control agreements and the change-in-control provisions\nof Dr. Su\u2019s employment agreement, each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive certain specified\npayments and benefits only if (a) a \u201cchange in control\u201d of us occurs and (b) the Named Executive Officer\u2019s\nemployment is terminated or the Named Executive Officer is constructively discharged within two years of the\nchange in control transaction (a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d arrangement). The Compensation Committee believes this\nstructure strikes a balance between our incentive arrangements and our executive hiring and retention\nobjectives without providing \u201cwindfall\u201d payments and benefits to any Named Executive Officers who continue\nemployment with an acquiring entity following a change in control of AMD.\nFor a detailed description of these agreements and arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, as well as\nan estimate of the amounts payable under such agreements and arrangements as of the last day of fiscal 2020,\nsee \u201cSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements.\u201d\nSeverance and Separation Arrangements\nAny post-employment compensation payable to our Chief Executive Officer is governed solely by her\nemployment agreement, the terms of which were the result of arms-length negotiations between her and the\nCompensation Committee. Under her employment agreement, Dr. Su is eligible to receive certain specified\npayments and benefits in the event that her employment is involuntarily terminated. The Compensation\nCommittee believes that the amount payable to Dr. Su pursuant to her employment agreement is reasonable\nand competitive and provides transition assistance in the event of her involuntary termination of employment,\nwith the goal of keeping her focused on our business rather than her personal circumstances.\nWith the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, all of our other Named Executive Officers participate in our\nExecutive Severance Plan for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents (the \u201cExecutive Severance\nPlan\u201d). The Executive Severance Plan is designed to provide uniform treatment in the event of an involuntary\ntermination of employment of our U.S. senior executives (except our Chief Executive Officer) and to provide\ntransition assistance in such instances with the goal of keeping these senior executives focused on our\nbusiness rather than their personal circumstances. A Named Executive Officer is not eligible to receive\npayments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plan if he or she receives severance payments and\nbenefits in connection with a change in control of AMD pursuant to his or her change in control agreement.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the Executive Severance Plan provides the covered executives\nimportant protections and promotes our objectives of attracting and retaining executive talent.\nFor a detailed description of the post-employment compensation arrangements of our Named Executive\nOfficers, as well as an estimate of the amounts payable under such arrangements as of the last day of fiscal\n2020, see \u201cSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements.\u201d\nOther Compensation Policies\nCompensation Recovery (\u201cClaw-back\u201d) Rights\nOur Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct provide that we may pursue all remedies available under\napplicable law to recover any incentive-based or other compensation (including equity awards) paid or\ngranted to our employees or agents in the event of such individual\u2019s direct involvement with fraud,\nmisconduct or gross negligence which contributes to an accounting restatement as a result of our material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting laws.\nIn addition, the award agreement for each stock option, RSU, and PRSU granted since May 2010 to an\nemployee at or above the level of senior vice president (which includes our Named Executive Officers) has\nincluded a compensation recoupment (\u201cclaw-back\u201d) provision. The claw-back provides the Compensation\nCommittee with the right to recover all or a portion of the compensation attributable to the award if the\nemployee\u2019s direct involvement with fraud, misconduct or his or her gross negligence contributes to or results\nin us being required to\n234 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprepare an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the federal securities laws. The claw-back does not apply to any award granted more than\n18 months before the date of the first public issuance or SEC filing of the financial document embodying the\nreporting requirement. In addition, (a) with respect to awards granted in and after August 2015, we may claw-\nback the award if the recipient violates the non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality terms of the\naward agreement as permitted under applicable law, or fails to comply with any agreement with us regarding\ninventions, intellectual property rights, or proprietary information or material, and (b) with respect to awards\ngranted after May 2019, we may claw-back the award if the recipient engages in certain workplace misconduct\n(including sexual harassment or age, sex or other prohibited discrimination) or a criminal act involving moral\nturpitude. The Compensation Committee may exercise these claw-back rights by cancellation, forfeiture,\nrepayment or disgorgement of any profits realized by the employee from the sale of our securities.\nWe continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to the development,\nimplementation and disclosure of compensation recovery provisions/policies. We expect to revise our\ncompensation recovery provisions/policies in the future if and as required by applicable law.\nStock Ownership Requirements\nOur stock ownership requirements are designed to increase our Named Executive Officers\u2019 stakes in us and to\nalign their interests more closely with those of our stockholders.\nIn August 2020, we increased our stock ownership requirements for our Named Executive Officers. These\nrequirements provide that on or before the Ownership Achievement Date (as defined below), our Chief\nExecutive Officer should attain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (a) six-times\nher then- current annual base salary or (b) 350,000 shares, and our other Named Executive Officers should\nattain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (x) 2.5 times their then-current annual\nbase salaries or (y) 80,000 shares.\nShares of our common stock counted toward the minimum stock ownership requirements include any shares\nheld directly or indirectly by a Named Executive Officer.\nThe \u201cOwnership Achievement Date\u201d is the later of August 7, 2025, or five years from first appointment as an\nexecutive officer. Until the guideline is achieved, each Named Executive Officer is encouraged to retain at least\n10% of the net shares (defined below) obtained through our stock incentive plans. For this purpose, the \u201cnet\nshares\u201d are the number of shares received from the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock\nor restricted stock unit awards, less the number of shares the Named Executive Officer sells to cover the\nexercise price of stock options or sells or has withheld to pay taxes.\nAs of December 26, 2020, each of our Named Executive Officers had satisfied his or her applicable stock\nownership requirement or has time remaining to do so.\nDeductibility of Executive Compensation\nSection 162(m) of the Code generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for federal income tax\npurposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers. While the Compensation\nCommittee may consider the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining our executive compensation,\nit also considers other factors in making its executive compensation decisions and retains the flexibility to\ngrant awards or pay compensation the Compensation Committee determines to be consistent with its goals for\nour executive compensation program, even if the awards may not be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the exception to the deductibility limit that was previously available for\n\u201cqualified performance-based compensation\u201d  (including stock option grants, performance-based cash\nbonuses and performance-based equity awards, such as the PRSUs) effective for taxable years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017. As a result, any compensation paid to certain of our Named Executive Officers for taxable\nyears beginning after December 31, 2017 in excess of $1 million will be non-deductible unless it qualifies for\ntransition relief afforded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to compensation payable pursuant to certain binding\narrangements in effect on November 2, 2017 and which are not subsequently materially modified.\n235 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAMD Compensation Policies and Practices\nIn February 2020, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for\nemployees generally and concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of management, assessed our\nexecutive and broad-based compensation and benefits programs to determine if any of them created undesired\nor excessive risks of a material nature. The assessment included (i) a review of our compensation policies and\npractices for employees generally, (ii) identification of the risks that could result from such policies and\npractices, (iii) identification of the risk mitigators and controls, and (iv) analysis of the potential risks against\nthe risk mitigators and controls and our business strategy and objectives. Although the Compensation\nCommittee reviewed our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee focused on the programs that\nhave variability of payout and in which employees could directly affect the payout of incentives. These\nprograms included the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cLTI\u201d), Sales Incentive Plan and\n2004 Plan.\nIn performing the assessment and reaching its conclusion, the Compensation Committee noted the following\nfactors that the Compensation Committee believes may reduce the likelihood of undesired or excessive risk-\ntaking:\nOur overall compensation levels are competitive with the market\u037e\nOur compensation practices and policies appropriately balance base pay versus variable pay and\nshort- term versus long-term incentives\u037e\nAlthough the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, LTI and Sales Incentive Plan have variability of payout, the\nCompensation Committee believes that any potential risks associated with such plans are controlled\nor mitigated by one or more of the following: (i) the performance goals being multi-dimensional (i.e.,\nadjusted non-GAAP net income, adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow, revenue), thereby increasing the\nrange of performance over which incentives are paid\u037e (ii) the performance goals being aligned with\nour business objectives and being quantitative financial measures\u037e (iii) the use of sliding payout\nscales, with the payouts in certain instances being linearly interpolated for performance falling\nbetween the performance levels set by the Compensation Committee\u037e (iv) the ability of the\nCompensation Committee and/or management to exercise discretion to reduce payouts\u037e (v) the\nexistence of multiple internal controls and approval processes that are intended to prevent\nmanipulation of outcomes by any employee, including the Named Executive Officers\u037e and (vi) the\nincentive opportunities being capped\u037e\nAlthough the grant of equity awards under the 2004 Plan could motivate our employees to, among\nother things, focus on increasing our short-term stock price rather than the creation of long-term\nstockholder value, the Compensation Committee believes that potential risks are controlled or\nmitigated by one or more of the following: (i) awarding a combination of PRSUs, RSUs and stock\noptions\u037e (ii) three-year vesting and performance period for PRSUs awarded in fiscal 2019 and 2020\n(with the exception of the Value Creation Equity Awards granted in fiscal 2019, which have a five-year\nperformance period)\u037e (iii) the vesting provisions of stock options and RSUs occurring over multi-year\nperiods\u037e (iv) caps on performance-based compensation opportunities\u037e and (v) our stock ownership\nguidelines for our executive officers. In addition, we prohibit our employees, including Named\nExecutive Officers, from engaging in hedging transactions in our securities\u037e and\nWe have implemented claw-back provisions and policies, as described in more detail in\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d above.\n236 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAMD Executive Compensation\nThe following table shows, for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the compensation for our Named Executive Officers.\nMessrs.

Participants may defer up to 50% of annual base salary and/or 100% of commissions and\nbonuses. Earnings on the deferred accounts are based on the performance of the investment funds selected\nby the participants. Participants make a deferral election, prior to the year in which the compensation is\nearned, that may not be terminated or changed during the year for which it was made. Generally, we make a\ndiscretionary contribution to the participant\u2019s account if his or her annual base salary, minus his or her\nSection 401(k) contribution before the deferral, is greater than the annual compensation limit for Section 401(k)\nplans. The contribution, if any, is equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of the deferred compensation credited to the\nparticipant\u2019s account for the year or (ii) a discretionary percentage of the participant\u2019s base salary in excess of\nthe eligible Section 401(k) compensation limit for the year minus the participant\u2019s Section 401(k) contributions.\nFor 2020, our discretionary contribution percentage under option (ii) above was 4.5%. Participants are 100%\nvested in the value of their accounts. Participants may select their desired benchmark investment fund(s) in\nwhich their accounts are deemed to be invested and may change their investment elections at any time, with\nsuch change effective as of the next business day. The amount of investment gain or loss that is credited to\nthe participant\u2019s account depends on the participant\u2019s investment election. For 2020, we utilized investment\nfunds in an array of asset classes, substantially aligned to those offered under our Section 401(k) plan. We\nhave placed assets in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the DIA. For 2020, the investment\nreturn credited to Messrs.

This investment return was calculated by\ntaking the aggregate gain in fiscal 2020 and dividing it by the aggregate balance as of the beginning of fiscal\n2020.\nThe DIA accounts are distributed following a participant\u2019s termination of employment with us unless the\nparticipant has elected an in-service withdrawal (scheduled or hardship withdrawal). At the time a participant\nmakes his or her deferral election, he or she may elect a different form of distribution for such year\u2019s deferred\ncompensation. The participant may elect a single lump sum distribution or annual installment distributions\nover three to ten years. The default form of distribution is a single lump sum. A participant may change the\nform of distribution election, subject to the terms of the DIA.\nA participant may elect to withdraw all or part of his or her account while employed by us, subject to the terms\nof the DIA. The in-service withdrawal date must be at least two years after the plan year in which the election\nwas made. An in-service withdrawal date may be changed, subject to the terms of the DIA. An unscheduled\npayment may also be made, subject to the terms of the DIA.\nSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements\nWe have entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Su, our current President and Chief Executive Officer.\nIn addition, Messrs. Kumar, Bergman, Grasby and Papermaster participate in the Executive Severance Plan and\nhave each entered into a change in control agreement with us.\nThe Executive Severance Plan and change in control agreements are designed to (i) implement a uniform\nprocess for handling potential future involuntary departures of the Named Executive Officers, and (ii)\nencourage the Named Executive Officers\u2019 continued services in the event of a potential change in control of\nus and to allow for a smooth transition upon such a change in control. In addition, these arrangements are\nintended to provide incentives to the Named Executive Officers to effectively execute the directives of the\nBoard, even in the event that such actions may result in the elimination of a Named Executive Officer\u2019s\nposition. Under the terms of the change in control agreements, a Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive\ncertain specified compensatory payments and benefits only if (i) a \u201cchange in control\u201d occurs, and (ii) the\nNamed Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated, or the Named Executive Officer is constructively\ndischarged, within two years of that change in control.\nDr. Su\u2019s Employment Agreement. Pursuant to Dr. Su\u2019s at-will employment agreement (the \u201cSu Employment\nAgreement\u201d), setting forth Dr. Su\u2019s duties and obligations as our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Su\nEmployment Agreement may be terminated by (i) us for Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement),\n(ii) Dr. Su\u2019s Involuntary Termination Without Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iii) Dr.\nSu\u2019s Constructive Termination (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iv) Dr. Su\u2019s voluntary election\nto terminate her employment with us, or (v) Dr. Su\u2019s death or disability.\nExcept as otherwise described in the next paragraph, in the event of Dr. Su\u2019s Involuntary Termination Without\nCause or Constructive Termination, subject to Dr. Su\u2019s execution of a full release of claims, which remains\neffective, following such termination:\nDr. Su will be credited with an additional 12 months of service for purposes of calculating the service-\nbased vesting of any unvested equity awards granted to Dr. Su on or after October 8, 2014 and 24\nmonths of service for purposes of calculating the service-based vesting of any unvested equity\nawards granted to Dr. Su before October 8, 2014. Any performance-based equity award for which the\nservice-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of termination will continue in\naccordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement and will be earned or forfeited based on\nactual performance for the applicable performance period. The settlement of any earned performance-\nbased equity award will occur at such time as such performance-based equity award would have been\nsettled had Dr. Su continued her employment with us\u037e\n244 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times her then base\nsalary\u037e\nWe will pay Dr. Su the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP, based on actual\nperformance for the year of termination and paid at the time annual bonuses are paid to other\nexecutives\u037e and\nWe will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA\npremium for continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group\nmedical and dental plans on a monthly basis.\nIn the event of Dr. Su\u2019s Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination between the\npublic announcement of a transaction that results in our Change of Control (as defined in the Su Employment\nAgreement) and 24 months after such Change of Control, subject to Dr. Su\u2019s execution of a full release of\nclaims, which remains effective, following such termination:\nWe will pay Dr. Su her earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and all other\namounts to which Dr. Su is entitled under any of our compensation plans or practices on the date of\ntermination\u037e\nAll unvested equity awards then held by Dr. Su will accelerate and be deemed fully vested, and all\nsuch equity awards then-outstanding that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, other\nthan Dr. Su\u2019s Value Creation Equity Award, will be deemed achieved at the target levels set forth in the\napplicable award agreement\u037e\nWe will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times her base salary plus\ntwo times her target annual bonus, in each case at the rate in effect immediately before the date of\ntermination or, if higher, the rate in effect six months before the date of termination\u037e\nWe will pay Dr. Su the pro rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the EIP assuming\nperformance at target levels for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination\u037e and\nWe will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA\npremium for continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group\nmedical and dental plans on a monthly basis. In addition, we will pay Dr. Su $4,000 per month for 12\nmonths following the date of termination for financial planning and tax planning services.\nUnder the terms of the Su Employment Agreement, upon a termination of employment in connection with a\nchange in control, Dr. Su\u2019s severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount\nas would result in no portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the\nCode (relating to Section 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax\nbasis (i.e., a parachute payment cut-back).\nExecutive Severance Plan for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents. With the exception of\nDr. Su, all of the Named Executive Officers participated in the Executive Severance Plan as of the end of 2020.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Plan, any participant who (i) is involuntarily terminated other than\nfor cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) or as a result of death or disability (as defined in the\nExecutive Severance Plan) and (ii) is not offered a job with one of our affiliates or a successor of us, will be\nentitled to the following benefits, subject to the participant\u2019s execution of a full release of claims, which\nremains effective, following such termination:\nWe will make a lump-sum cash payment to the participant in an amount equal to 12 months of base\nsalary\u037e\nWe will, for 12 months following the date of termination, pay COBRA premiums for continuation\ncoverage under our group medical and dental plans\u037e and\nWe will allow participants to use our Employee Assistance Plan for up to 12 months.\n245 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditionally, we will seek reimbursement on a pro rata basis, of severance benefits if we re-employ a\nparticipant during the 12 months following receipt of a severance payment under the SVP Severance Plan.\nThe Executive Severance Plan is intended to represent the exclusive severance benefits payable to a\nparticipant by us. Accordingly, any Participant who is entitled to receive severance benefits payable in\nconnection with a change of control pursuant to a change in control agreement may not also receive\nseverance benefits under the SVP Severance Plan. In other words, a participant may not collect severance\nbenefits under the SVP Severance Plan if he or she receives benefits under a change in control agreement with\nus.\nAlthough we expect to maintain the Executive Severance Plan indefinitely, we may amend, modify or terminate\nthe Executive Severance Plan at any time. Therefore, severance benefits under the Executive Severance Plan\nare not guaranteed and may be eliminated in the future. The form of release agreement used under our\nExecutive Severance Plan includes a customary non-disparagement agreement and a one-year employee non-\nsolicitation agreement.\nChange in Control Agreements. We entered into change in control agreements with Messrs. Kumar, Bergman,\nGrasby and Papermaster designed to encourage their continued services in the event of a change in control.\nFor purposes of these change in control agreements, a change in control generally means any of the following\nevents:\nthe acquisition by any person representing more than 50% of our then outstanding shares of stock or\nthe combined voting power of our voting securities\u037e\na change of the majority of the Board during any two consecutive years, unless certain Board\napproval conditions are met\u037e\na merger or consolidation of us into any other corporation, where immediately after the merger or\nconsolidation 50% or less of the combined voting power is held by holders of our voting securities\nimmediately before such merger or consolidation\u037e or\nthe stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or there is a consummated a sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets.\nThe change in control agreements provide that, if within two years after a change in control, the Named\nExecutive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated by us without cause or they are constructively discharged, the\nNamed Executive Officer will receive:\na lump sum severance benefit equal to the sum of two times the executive\u2019s rate of annual base\ncompensation at the rate in effect immediately before the date of termination or, if higher, the rate in\neffect six months before the date of the change in control, plus two times the target annual bonus in\nthe year of termination\u037e\nall unvested equity will vest and be exercisable, and options may be exercised for the period of one\nyear from the date of termination or the original option term, whatever is shorter\u037e\npayment of the executive\u2019s prorated accrued bonus assuming performance at target levels for the\nportion of the year prior to the date of termination\u037e\nreimbursement of personal financial and tax planning up to $4,000 for twelve months following the\ndate of termination\u037e and\n12 months\u2019 continued health and welfare benefits comparable to those in effect at termination and a\ngross-up for any income taxes due as a result of the payment by us for such health and welfare\nbenefits.\nThe payments and benefits pursuant to the change in control agreements are subject to the executive\u2019s\nexecution of a release of claims. Further, upon a termination of employment in connection with a change in\ncontrol, the executive\u2019s severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount as\nwould result in\n246 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nno portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (relating to\nSection 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax basis (i.e., a\nparachute payment cut-back).\nAMD Policies. In April 2009, we adopted a policy to, in general, not enter into any new change in control\nagreements or arrangements containing an excise tax gross-up provision. Dr. Su\u2019s change in control agreement\ndoes not provide for an excise tax gross-up.\nIn March 2010, we also adopted a policy to not enter into any new change in control agreement or\narrangement with any executive officer that provides for a cash severance payment (upon both our change in\ncontrol and a subsequent termination of employment) in excess of (i) two times the sum of the respective\nexecutive officer\u2019s base salary and annual target bonus, plus (ii) a prorated annual target bonus for the year in\nwhich the termination of employment occurs. Dr. Su\u2019s change in control agreement complies with this\nlimitation.\nVesting of Awards. All RSUs and stock options granted under our equity incentive plans become fully vested\n(i) if our successor refuses to assume or substitute similar awards for outstanding awards, upon a change in\ncontrol, or (ii) if our successor assumes or substitutes similar awards for outstanding awards and the\nparticipant\u2019s employment is terminated by our successor for any reason (other than for misconduct) or by the\nparticipant due to a constructive termination within one year following a change in control, upon such\ntermination of employment. All PRSUs vest to the extent the applicable performance criteria were achieved.\nUpon a change in control, the Compensation Committee shall determine and approve the Company\u2019s\nperformance with respect to the applicable performance vesting conditions as of the effective date of the\nchange in control and the participant will be deemed to have earned that number of PRSUs, which will be\nconverted automatically into an equal number of RSUs that will vest as of the first to occur of (i) the one-year\nanniversary of the change in control or (ii) the last day of the originally scheduled performance period. All\nremaining unearned PRSUs will be automatically forfeited without consideration. If the participant\u2019s\nemployment or service with the Company is involuntarily terminated for any reason (other than misconduct)\nafter a change in control, then all such converted RSUs will become fully vested as of the date of termination.\nUpon death or disability, the participant or the participant\u2019s estate shall have the right for a period of twelve\n(12) months following the date of death or termination of status as a service provider to exercise any stock\noptions to the extent the participant was entitled to exercise such stock options on the date of death or\ntermination. For the Value Creation Equity Awards, if Dr. Su incurs a \u201ccovered termination\u201d  (as defined in her\nemployment agreement) or if Mr. Papermaster\u2019s employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated\n(other than for misconduct) during the performance period, then (a) the unvested earned Value Creation Equity\nAwards held by Dr. Su or Mr. Papermaster, as applicable, that were scheduled to vest on or before the one-\nyear anniversary of the termination date will immediately vest and (b) the unvested unearned Value Creation\nEquity Awards held by Dr. Su or Mr. Papermaster, as applicable, will remain outstanding for 12 months (or, if\nearlier, until August 9, 2024 or the date of a change in control) and vest if such Value Creation Equity Awards\nwould have vested had he or she remained employed in a covered position for such period.\nPotential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. The following table presents the amount of\ncompensation and benefits payable to Dr. Su under her employment agreement in the event of (i) an\ninvoluntary termination without cause or a constructive termination (without a change in control), (ii) an\ninvoluntary termination without cause or a constructive termination immediately following the consummation\nof a change in control and (iii) a separation due to death. As required by SEC rules, the amounts shown\nassume that the termination or death was effective as of December 26, 2020, exclude amounts earned through\nthat time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to Dr. Su. For purposes of the below\ncalculations, the value of each share of our common stock underlying an option, RSU or PRSU is assumed to\nbe $91.81, the last reported sales price of our common stock on December 24, 2020, the last trading day of our\nfiscal 2020.\n247 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n(5) \n(6) \n(7) \n(8) \n(9) \n(10) \n(11) \n(12) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe actual amounts to be paid out to Dr. Su can only be determined at the time of Dr. Su\u2019s separation from us.\nName\nType of \nBenefit\nInvoluntary \nTermination\nWithout \nCause/Constructive\nTermination \n($)\nQualifying \nTermination\nFollowing a \nChange in \nControl \n($)\nSeparation Due \nto Death or\nDisability \n($)\nLisa T.

Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the PRSUs convert into a\nnumber of time-based RSUs determined based on achievement as of the date of the change in control. These time-\nbased RSUs would immediately vest upon Dr. Su\u2019s qualifying termination immediately following the change in\ncontrol.\nAmount represents our cost of paying COBRA premiums on behalf of Dr. Su and her dependents for 24 months\nfollowing her termination based on rates for a current employee.\nPursuant to our Executive Life Insurance Benefit Plan, amount reflects a life insurance payout equal to three times\nDr. Su\u2019s base salary of $1,055,000, subject to a maximum of $2,000,000.\nPursuant to Dr. Su\u2019s employment agreement, she is entitled to $4,000 per month in financial planning for a 12-month\nperiod following termination.\nIn the event that the severance and other benefits provided would be subject to excise taxes imposed by Section\n280G and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such amount will either be delivered in full or reduced so as\nnot to be subject to excise taxation, whichever amount is higher, pursuant to the terms of Dr. Su\u2019s Employment\nAgreement.\nThe following table presents the amount that would be payable to Messrs.

This ratio is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934.

We annualized base pay and estimated bonus for any regular employees who commenced\nwork during 2020 and did not annualize these amounts for temporary and seasonal employees. The annual\ntotal compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of the CEO were calculated in\naccordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and the median employee\u2019s annual\ntotal compensation was converted to U.S. dollars using a currency exchange rate as of December 26, 2020.\nFor additional details on the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, see \u201cCompensation Discussion\nand Analysis.\u201d\n251 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAMD Equity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table provides information as of December 26, 2020 with respect to shares of our common stock\nthat may be issued under our existing equity compensation plans.

Xilinx stockholders\u2019 rights are also governed by the Xilinx charter and bylaws. If the merger is\ncompleted, the rights of Xilinx stockholders who become AMD stockholders will be governed by the AMD\ncharter and bylaws.\nAs AMD and Xilinx are both Delaware corporations, the rights of AMD and Xilinx stockholders are not\nmaterially different. However, there are certain differences in the rights of AMD stockholders under the AMD\ncharter and bylaws and of Xilinx stockholders under the Xilinx charter and bylaws, as summarized in the table\nbelow. This summary does not purport to be a complete statement of all the differences, or a complete\ndescription of the specific provisions referred to. Further, the identification of specific differences is not\nintended to indicate that other equally or more significant differences do not exist. AMD and Xilinx\nstockholders should carefully read the relevant provisions of the AMD charter, the AMD bylaws, the Xilinx\ncharter, the Xilinx bylaws and the DGCL.
