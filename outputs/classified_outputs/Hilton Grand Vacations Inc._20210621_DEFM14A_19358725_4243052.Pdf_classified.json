        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS AND SPECIAL MEETING\nThe following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have about the proposals being considered at the special meeting of our\nstockholders, which we refer to as the \u201cspecial meeting.\u201d We urge you to carefully read this entire proxy statement, including its Annexes, and the other\ndocuments to which this proxy statement refers or incorporates by reference, because this section does not provide all of the information that might be\nimportant to you. Also see the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference\u201d beginning on page 155 of this\nproxy statement.\n \nQ:\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\n \nA:\nOn March 10, 2021, we, HGV Borrower, Diamond, the Apollo Investors, and the other stockholders of Diamond entered into the merger agreement,\na copy of which is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. The merger agreement provides that we will acquire Diamond in a series of\ntransactions (the \u201cmerger\u201d). After the completion of the merger, Diamond will cease to exist as a separate company and all of its assets and\nliabilities will be assumed by HGV Borrower, the surviving entity of the merger, and HGV Borrower will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof HGV.\nIf the merger is completed, the Diamond stockholders are currently expected to receive an aggregate of approximately 34,746,298 shares (based on\ncalculations as of June 1, 2021) of our common stock par value $0.01 per share (\u201cour common stock\u201d), subject to certain adjustments as a result of\nchanges in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing. As a result, based on Diamond\u2019s current capitalization, Diamond\nstockholders are expected to receive approximately 0.32022 shares of our common stock (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021) for each share\nof Diamond Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cDiamond common stock\u201d), other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in the merger\nagreement), treasury shares and shares owned directly or indirectly by Diamond, that they own immediately before the merger, subject to\nadjustment as a result of changes in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing of the merger in accordance with the terms of\nthe merger agreement (such ratio, the \u201cexchange ratio\u201d), plus cash for any fractional shares, without interest.\n \nQ:\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\n \nA:\nYou are receiving this proxy statement because you are a stockholder of record of HGV on the record date. This proxy statement serves as the\nproxy statement through which we will solicit proxies to obtain the necessary stockholder approval for the proposed issuance of our common\nstock to Diamond stockholders in connection with the merger. The merger itself does not require any HGV stockholder approval.\nThe Diamond stockholders have already approved the merger agreement and the merger, pursuant to a written consent dated March 10, 2021.\nAccordingly, there will not be a separate meeting for Diamond stockholders. In addition, Diamond does not file reports with the SEC nor is its\ncommon stock publicly traded on any exchange.\nThis proxy statement, including its Annexes, contains and incorporates by reference important information about us and Diamond, the merger and\nthe special meeting. You should read all the available information carefully and in its entirety.\nYour vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible.\n \nQ:\nWhen and where will the special meeting be held?\n \nA:\nThe special meeting will be held at 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Orlando, Florida 32839, on July 28, 2021 at 9:00  a.m., Eastern time.\n \nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nOnly holders of record of outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on June 1 , 2021, which we refer to as the record\ndate, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.\n \n3Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nIn accordance with Delaware law (the law under which we are incorporated) and our bylaws, the presence of the holders of a majority in voting\npower of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is required to\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, or if there are not sufficient votes at the time\nof the special meeting to approve the stock issuance proposal, the special meeting may be adjourned to allow more time for obtaining additional\nproxies or votes without further notice other than by announcement of the time and place of the adjourned meeting at the special meeting, unless\nthe adjournment is for more than thirty days in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to\nvote at the adjourned meeting. If after the adjournment, a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, our\nboard of directors will fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting and will give notice of the adjourned meeting to each\nstockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any such\nadjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. At\nany subsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original\nconvening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn before the adjourned meeting.\nAbstentions (shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from voting) will be\nincluded in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum has been achieved. However, broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock\nrepresented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.\n \nQ:\nHow do I vote my shares of common stock?\n \nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote in person by attending the special meeting, or, to ensure your shares are\nrepresented at the special meeting, in advance of the special meeting you may authorize a proxy to vote by:\n \n \n\u2022\n accessing the internet website specified on your proxy card and following the on-screen instructions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n signing, dating and mailing your proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.\nIf you are a beneficial owner who holds shares of our common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a stock brokerage account or through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your shares are\nrepresented at the special meeting. Beneficial owners may vote at the special meeting only if they obtain a legal proxy from their bank, broker or\nother nominee before the special meeting.\n \nQ:\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\n \nA:\nOur board of directors, after careful consideration of the various factors described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\u201d beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously\ndetermined that the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders, authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance\nof shares of our common stock in the merger, and the other transactions contemplated thereby by a unanimous vote, and adopted resolutions\ndirecting that the stock issuance proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration and approval.\n \n4\nTable of Contents\nAccordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the stock issuance proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nIn relation to the compensation proposal, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to\nterminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger and, accordingly, we do not anticipate making any change in control\npayments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to our other named executive officers as a result of the merger.\n \nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve each proposal and how are abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes treated?\n \nA:\nThe approval of the stock issuance proposal and the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes\ncast and entitled to vote on each proposal. The approval of the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of\nthe stockholders of a majority in voting power present if a quorum is not present or, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the votes cast. Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the stock issuance\nproposal, compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\n \nQ:\nMy shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or other nominee. Will my bank, broker or other nominee automatically vote my\nshares for me?\n \nA:\nNo. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial holder\u201d of the shares held for you in\nwhat is known as \u201cstreet name.\u201d You are not the \u201crecord holder\u201d of such shares. If this is the case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to\nyou by your bank, broker or other nominee. As the beneficial holder, unless your bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority over\nyour shares, you generally have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority.\nThis is often called a \u201cbroker non-vote.\u201d With respect to the special meeting, your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\nYou should therefore provide your bank, broker or other nominee with instructions as to how to vote your shares of our common stock.\nPlease follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee so that it may vote your shares on your behalf. Please note\nthat you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to us or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you\nfirst obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \nQ:\nWhat will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?\n \nA:\nIf you properly complete and sign your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the\nshares of our common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as our board of directors recommends and, therefore, will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d\neach of the proposals being submitted to a vote of our common stockholders at the special meeting.\n \nQ:\nCan I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card?\n \nA:\nYes, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of\nrecord, you can do this in one of three ways.\n \n \n\u2022\n you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date, including by telephone or through the internet before the closing of those voting\nfacilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021\u037e\n \n5\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n you can send a signed notice of revocation to Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839,\nAttention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n you can attend and vote at the special meeting, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given. Simply attending the special\nmeeting without voting at the special meeting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or otherwise change your vote.\nIf you have submitted a proxy for your shares by telephone or via the internet, you may revoke your prior telephone or internet proxy by any\nmanner described above.\nIf you are a \u201cbeneficial holder\u201d who holds shares of our common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to\nchange your vote.\n \nQ:\nDo I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than voting for the proposals at the special meeting?\n \nA:\nNo. If the merger is consummated, you are not required to take any action with respect to your shares of our common stock.\n \nQ:\nDo I have appraisal rights?\n \nA:\nNo. You, as an HGV stockholder, do not have appraisal rights as a result of the merger.\n \nQ:\nHow will HGV stockholders be affected by the merger?\n \nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, each HGV stockholder will hold the same number of shares of our common stock that such stockholder held\nimmediately prior to completion of the merger. As a result of the merger, our stockholders will own shares in a larger company with more assets.\nHowever, because HGV will be issuing additional shares of our common stock to Diamond stockholders in exchange for their shares of Diamond\ncommon stock, each outstanding share of our common stock immediately prior to the merger will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate\nnumber of shares of our common stock outstanding after the merger. Our common stock will continue to be traded on the New York Stock\nExchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) following consummation of the merger.\n \nQ:\nWhen does HGV expect to complete the merger?\n \nA:\nWe are currently expecting to complete the merger in early August 2021. However, we cannot predict the actual date on which the merger will be\ncompleted, nor can we assure you that the merger will be completed, because completion is subject to conditions beyond either company\u2019s\ncontrol. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 102 of this proxy\nstatement.\n \nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\n \nA:\nIf the stock issuance proposal is not approved by our stockholders or the merger is not completed for any other reason, Diamond\u2019s stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for shares of Diamond common stock that they own. Instead, we will not issue any shares of our common stock as\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, we will continue to conduct our operations as currently conducted, and Diamond will remain an\nindependent company.\nUnder specified circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee upon termination of the merger agreement, as described under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees and Expenses\u201d beginning on page 104 of this proxy statement.\n \n6\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWho will own HGV immediately following the merger?\n \nA:\nWe estimate that, upon completion of the merger, our stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger will own approximately 72% and Diamond\nstockholders will own approximately 28% of our total shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021).\n \nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to HGV stockholders?\n \nA:\nHolders of our common stock will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger related to their ownership of our common stock.\n \nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\n \nA:\nIf you have questions about the merger, the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or how to submit a proxy, or if you desire\nadditional copies of this proxy statement or additional proxy cards, you should contact Okapi Partners LLC, our proxy solicitor, at:\nOkapi Partners LLC\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor\nNew York, New York 10036\nBanks and brokers call: +1-212-297-0720\nStockholders and all others call toll-free: (888) 785-6707\nEmail: info@okapipartners.com\n \n7\nTable of Contents",

In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of HGV and Diamond\nbecause those risks will also affect us on a combined basis after giving effect to the merger. Those risks that relate to us can be found in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and any\namendments thereto, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on\nForm 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement\nand the other documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. See the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information and\nIncorporation by Reference\u201d beginning on page 155 of this proxy statement. Finally, because Diamond is privately owned, it does not file SEC reports.\nAccordingly, included in the following risks are those that relate specifically to Diamond under \u201c\u2014Risks Related to Diamond.\u201d Due to the fact that our\nand Diamond\u2019s businesses are similar, Diamond is also subject to substantially all of the risks that are related to our business that are noted under \u201c\u2014\nRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d When reviewing such risks related to our business, you should assume all such risks also relate to Diamond and its\nbusiness and operations.\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nThe exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in our stock price.\nThe calculation of the exchange ratio is pre-determined such that each share of Diamond common stock (other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in\nthe merger agreement), treasury shares, and shares owned directly or indirectly by Diamond) is currently expected to be converted into the right to\nreceive 0.32022 shares of our common stock in connection with the merger (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021), subject to certain adjustments as a\nresult of changes in certain liabilities and other items between signing and closing of the merger. This exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in\nthe market price of our common stock between the date of signing the merger agreement and completion of the merger.\nChanges in the price of our common stock before the closing of the merger will affect the market value of our common stock that Diamond common\nstockholders will receive at the closing of the merger. The price of our common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from their prices on the date\nthe merger agreement was executed, on the date of this proxy statement and on the date of the special meeting. As a result, the value represented by the\nexchange ratio will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of our common stock during the period from March 9, 2021, the last\ntrading day before public announcement of the merger agreement, through June 17, 2021, the latest practicable trading date before the date of this proxy\nstatement, the exchange ratio represented a value ranging from a high of $14.72 to a low of $12.16 for each share of Diamond common stock, as\ndetermined by reference to the value of merger consideration to be received for each share of Diamond common stock in the merger.\nThese variations could result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of Diamond or HGV before or following the merger, regulatory\nconsiderations, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond our and Diamond\u2019s control. The merger may be\ncompleted a considerable period after the date of the special meeting. Therefore, at the time of the special meeting, stockholders will not know with\ncertainty the value of the shares of our common stock that will be issued upon completion of the merger.\n \n22Table of Contents\nWe are subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions, including pending litigation and the risk of additional litigation, while the\nmerger is pending, which may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, vendors,\ncustomers or others.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on relationships with our employees, suppliers, vendors, customers, or others may have an adverse\neffect on us. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Diamond\u2019s and our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause suppliers, vendors, customers,\nand others that deal with us to seek to change, not renew or discontinue existing business relationships with us.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be challenging before the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may have\nuncertainty about their future roles with HGV after the merger. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or prospective key\nemployees are unwilling to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain\nwith us, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process\ncould adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, the merger agreement restricts us and Diamond, without the other party\u2019s consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other\nspecified actions until the merger closes or the merger agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us and Diamond from pursuing otherwise\nattractive business opportunities and making other changes to our respective businesses before completion of the merger or termination of the merger\nagreement. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conduct of Business\u201d beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the merger is the absence of any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, having\nbeen entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or\nprohibition that prevents the consummation of the merger. We and our board of directors were named as defendants in lawsuits brought by purported\nHGV stockholders challenging the adequacy of the public disclosures related to the merger and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin us\nfrom completing the merger. If a settlement or other resolution is not reached in these lawsuits and any of the plaintiffs in such pending litigation or in\npossible future lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger, then such injunction may prevent the\nmerger from being completed, or delay it from being completed within the expected time frame.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and the future of our business and financial results.\nIf the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to several risks, including the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n being required to pay a termination fee to Diamond under certain circumstances as provided in the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n having to pay certain costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and other fees and expenses\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n our common stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be\ncompleted\u037e and\n \n23\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n having had the focus of our senior management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to\nus and our stockholders.\nIf the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial results and stock price.\nOur ability to complete the merger is subject to certain closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which\nmay impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the merger to be abandoned.\nThe merger agreement contains certain closing conditions, including, among others:\n \n \n\u2022\n the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement, subject to the qualifications\ndescribed in more detail herein\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the other party having performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the absence of a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d impacting the other party\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the approval of the stock issuance proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our common stock at a\nstockholders\u2019 meeting duly called and held for such purpose\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the absence of any judgment, order, law or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that\nprevents the consummation of the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the approval for listing by the NYSE of the shares of our common stock issuable in the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the receipt of all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, or expirations of waiting periods imposed\nby, the COFECE under the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law and the Federal Competition Authority under the Austrian Cartel\nAct and the Competition Act\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n certain ancillary agreements having been delivered and not having been rescinded or repudiated by certain parties\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the absence of defaults under Diamond\u2019s unsecured notes and absence of defaults and sufficient availability under Diamond\u2019s warehouse\nfacilities.\nWe cannot assure you that the various closing conditions will be satisfied, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect us\nfollowing the merger or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger.\nWe may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the merger, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we anticipate certain cost savings from the consummation of the merger, our ability to achieve such estimated cost savings in the timeframe\ndescribed, or at all, is subject to various assumptions by our management, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in\nour operations that offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize cost savings within the timeframe\nexpected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings. Failure to achieve the expected cost\nsavings could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the merger and adversely affect us.\n \n24\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement. We expect to continue to incur non-recurring costs associated with consummating the merger, combining the\noperations of the two companies and achieving the desired cost savings. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The\nsubstantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the merger and include, among others, fees paid to financial,\nlegal and accounting advisors, employee benefit costs and filing fees. These costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results following the consummation of the merger and many of these costs\nwill be borne by us even if the merger is not consummated.\nAny delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits that we expect to achieve.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion\nof the merger. We cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize\nsome or all of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within the expected time frame. See the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Completion of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 102 of this proxy statement.\nOur directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders\ngenerally.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, and our board of directors unanimously recommended\nthat our stockholders vote in favor of the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. These directors and\nexecutive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders. These interests include the\ncontinued employment of our executive officers after the merger, the continued service of all of our directors following the merger, and other rights held\nby our directors and executive officers. Our stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider our board of directors\u2019 recommendation\nthat they vote in favor of the stock issuance proposal and the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting.\nOur board of directors was aware of these potential interests and considered them in making its recommendations to approve the stock issuance\nproposal and the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting. The interests of our directors and executive officers are described in more\ndetail in the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 74 of this proxy\nstatement.\nThe opinion obtained by our board of directors from its financial advisor does not and will not reflect changes in circumstances after the date of\nsuch opinion.\nOn March 9, 2021, BofA Securities delivered an opinion to our board of directors that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject\nto the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in BofA Securities\u2019 opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to HGV. Changes in the operations and prospects of Diamond or HGV, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may\nbe beyond our control, and on which the opinion of BofA Securities was based, may alter our or Diamond\u2019s value or the price at which shares of our\ncommon stock are traded by the time the merger is completed. We have not obtained, and we do not expect to request, an updated opinion from our\nfinancial advisor. BofA Securities\u2019 opinion does not speak to the time when the merger will be completed or to any date other than the date of such\nopinion. As a result, the opinion does not and will not address the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by us in\nthe merger pursuant to the merger agreement at the time the merger is completed or at any time other than the date when opinion was rendered. For a more\ncomplete description of the opinion that our board of directors received from our financial advisor and a summary of the material financial\n \n25\nTable of Contents\nanalyses BofA Securities provided to our board of directors in connection with rendering such opinion, please refer to \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Our\nFinancial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement and the full text of such written opinion included as Annex B to this proxy statement.\nRisks if the Merger is Completed\nWe may not be able to integrate successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining us and Diamond may not be realized.\nWe entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including, among other things, operating\nefficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of HGV and\nDiamond can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.\nIt is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of\neach company\u2019s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation\narrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Our results of operations could also be\nadversely affected by any issues attributable to Diamond\u2019s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur before the closing of the\nmerger. We may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to\na number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure\nto achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected net income and could adversely affect our\nfuture business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nFurthermore, we have agreed with Hilton to develop a mutually agreeable plan pursuant to which the Diamond properties are to be operated during\nthe integration period, and with respect to those Diamond properties that will not be converted to our brand. If we fail to develop such a plan with Hilton,\nsuch properties may remain subject to a number of restrictions related to how they are operated, and such restrictions may reduce the efficiencies\nanticipated in connection with the merger.\nWe will take on additional indebtedness to finance the merger, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations, including by decreasing our business flexibility, as well as our ability to meet payment obligations under our indebtedness.\nIn connection with the completion of the merger, we intend to significantly increase our level of indebtedness. As part of such plan, we closed an\nunregistered offering of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2029 and priced an unregistered offering of $500 million in\naggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2031, which is expected to close on June 28, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Our\nincreased level of debt, together with certain covenants and restrictions that will be imposed on us in connection with incurring this indebtedness, will,\namong other things: (a) require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of debt\u037e (b) reduce funds\navailable for strategic initiatives and opportunities, dividends, share repurchases, working capital and other general corporate needs\u037e (c) limit our ability\nto incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness, which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business, industry and\neconomic conditions and increase borrowing costs\u037e (d) create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels and\n(e) increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. These covenants and restrictions may limit how our business is\nconducted. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants and restrictions and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain\nwaivers thereto and/or amend these covenants and restrictions. Our failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions could result in an event of\ndefault, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay such indebtedness before its due date or to have to negotiate\namendments to or waivers thereof, which may have unfavorable terms or result in the incurrence of additional fees and expenses.\n \n26\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to make scheduled cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our\nability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,\nlegislative, regulatory and other factors, including the continued adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, that are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on\nour indebtedness.\nIn addition, our credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings will reflect\neach rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations on a combined basis with\nDiamond. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, operating results and share and debt prices,\nas well as our obligations with respect to our capital efficient inventory acquisitions.\nThe pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our\nfinancial condition or results of operations after the merger.\nOur operating results after the merger may be materially different from those shown in the pro forma financial information presented in this proxy\nstatement, which does not purport to represent what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would actually have been if the merger had\noccurred as of the date indicated or what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would be for any future periods. The pro forma\nfinancial information contained in this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only, is based on various adjustments, assumptions,\njudgments, and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our future financial condition or results of operations resulting from the merger for\nseveral reasons. See the section entitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information of HGV and Diamond\u201d beginning on\npage 136 of this proxy statement. The actual financial condition and results of operations of us following the merger may not be consistent with, or\nevident from, this pro forma financial information. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be\naccurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the completion of the merger. Any potential decline in our\nfinancial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in our stock price after merger. The costs, fees and expenses related to the\nmerger could be higher than currently estimated. Further, because the determination of fair value is dependent upon valuations that must be performed as\nof the date the merger is consummated, the valuations underlying the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement may be\nrevised after the date hereof. Any such adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value could be material.\nFollowing the completion of the merger, our vacation ownership business will depend on the quality and reputation of the brands associated with\nthe portfolios of each of HGV and Diamond, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could adversely affect our market\nshare, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing completion of the merger, we intend to offer vacation ownership products and services under the Hilton Vacation Club brand, a new\nupscale HGV sub-brand that will consist of rebranded Diamond properties, all pursuant to the Amended and Restated License Agreement with Hilton (the\n\u201cA&R Hilton license agreement\u201d). If the quality of any of these brands deteriorates, or the reputation of these brands declines, including as the result of\nactions by Hilton, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See \u201cRisks\nRelated to our Relationship with Hilton\u201d below.\n \n27\nTable of Contents\nThe maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties depends on maintenance fees paid by the owners of VOIs.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our and Diamond\u2019s VOIs by property owners\u2019 association boards are used to maintain and\nrefurbish the vacation ownership properties, to maintain reserves for capital expenditures, and to keep the properties in compliance with applicable brand\nstandards. Property owners\u2019 association boards may elect to not levy sufficient maintenance fees, or owners of VOIs may fail to pay their maintenance\nfees for reasons such as financial hardship, dissatisfaction with the merger or because of damage to their VOIs from natural disasters such as hurricanes.\nIn these circumstances, not only could our and Diamond\u2019s management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the vacation ownership properties could\nfall into disrepair and fail to comply with applicable brand standards. If a resort fails to comply with applicable brand standards, Hilton could terminate our\nright under the A&R Hilton license agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which could result in the loss of management fees,\ndecreased customer satisfaction and impairment of our ability to market and sell products at the non-compliant locations. See \u201cRisks Related to Our\nRelationship with Hilton\u201d below.\nIf maintenance fees at our or Diamond\u2019s resorts are required to be increased, our or Diamond\u2019s products could become less attractive and our or\nDiamond\u2019s business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our and Diamond\u2019s VOIs by property owners\u2019 association boards may increase as the costs to\nmaintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties, to maintain reserves for capital expenditures, and to keep the properties in compliance with\nbrand standards increase. A similar situation may arise with respect to fees imposed on owners of VOIs with respect to new properties added to our\nportfolio following the completion of the merger. Increased maintenance fees could make our or Diamond\u2019s products less desirable, which could have a\nnegative impact on sales of our or Diamond\u2019s products and could also cause an increase in defaults with respect to our or Diamond\u2019s vacation ownership\nnotes receivable portfolio.\nWe will incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the merger.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring expenses both before and after completing the merger, including fees for third party legal, investment\nbanking and advisory services, the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in\nconnection with the merger, obtaining necessary consents and approvals and combining the operations of the two companies. These fees and costs will\nbe substantial. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in our integration of Diamond. Although it is expected that the elimination of certain\nduplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction\nrelated costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Further, if the merger is not completed, we would have to recognize\nthese expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. See \u201c\u2014Risks Related to the Merger\u2014The pro forma financial information included\nin this proxy statement is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations after the\nmerger\u201d above.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the completion of the merger and will exercise less influence over\nmanagement of us as compared to currently.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of\nthe merger, each Diamond stockholder who receives shares of our common stock will become our stockholder. It is currently expected that the former\nDiamond stockholders as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 28% of the shares of our common stock on a fully diluted\nbasis immediately after the completion of the merger. As a result, our current stockholders as a group will own approximately 72% of the shares of our\ncommon stock on a fully diluted\n \n28\nTable of Contents\nbasis immediately after the completion of the merger. Because of this, our stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the\ncombined company than they now have on the management and policies of us prior to the merger.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of the merger.\nFollowing the completion of the merger, the size of our business will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or Diamond\u2019s\ncurrent operations. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, including in non-US jurisdictions where we\ndo not currently have operations, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring\nof new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may also need to obtain approvals of developers or HOAs in various instances to\ninclude additional resorts in the Diamond Collections or increase maintenance fees or impose additional requirements in order to meet our brand and\noperating standards. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and\nother benefits currently anticipated from the transactions. In addition, there will be increased compliance and regulatory risk as a result of the expanded\nsize of our business.\nWe may not be able to retain our and/or Diamond personnel successfully after the merger is completed.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by us and\nDiamond. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with us or Diamond, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with us after the\nmerger is consummated.\nIf key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business\nactivities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Diamond to hiring suitable replacements,\nall of which may cause our business to suffer. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either\ncompany, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.\nWe and Diamond may be subject to complaints, litigation or reputational harm due to dissatisfaction with, or concerns related to, the merger from\nour current owners.\nOur current owners may be concerned about the actual or perceived impact of the merger on their VOIs, including related to a reduced quality of\nresorts and product offerings due to the increased size of the business and addition of new owners, or increase or change in HOA or other fees.\nDiamond\u2019s current owners may have similar concerns related to a decline in the quality of product offerings or increase in fees as a result of the merger\nand increase in size of the business. Complaints or litigation brought by existing owners following the completion of the merger could harm our\nreputation, discourage potential new owners and adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Diamond\u2019s Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and will likely continue to have a significant adverse impact on, the business, financial condition and\nresults of operations of Diamond for the foreseeable future.\nTourism and travel-related industries continue to face significant disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It may be an extended period of\ntime before the business operations of Diamond and its affiliates return to full operational capacity or occupancy, particularly if there remains lingering\nactual and/or perceived concern and perception of significant transmission and infection risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Diamond has implemented\nnew social distancing, hygiene protocols, and enhanced cleaning measures at its resorts, sales centers, and corporate offices in accordance with\nguidelines from federal, state and local authorities. Diamond\n \n29\nTable of Contents\nand its subsidiaries\u2019 management implemented and trained team members on the \u201cDiamond Standard of Clean.\u201d These measures, which are intended to\nprotect human life, may result in additional costs, operational inefficiencies, and fewer revenue opportunities.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various governmental mandates and orders for business closure, Diamond temporarily closed\noperations at substantially all of their resorts and closed substantially all of their sales centers. With the lifting or easing of such restrictions in certain\nlocations in the United States, Diamond has re-opened the majority of its resorts and sales centers, albeit at reduced capacity levels and revenue has not\nreturned to pre-pandemic levels. However, any re-opening of the resorts may be delayed, interrupted or reversed depending on government orders or\nrecommendations or based on assessments of the state of the pandemic. It may be an extended period of time before the resorts return to pre-pandemic\noperational capacity or occupancy, particularly if there remains lingering actual and/or perceived concern and perception of significant transmission and\ninfection risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in connection with any variant strains of the virus.\nAny sustained materially adverse impact on Diamond\u2019s revenues, net income and other operating results due to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic could cause Diamond to breach its operating and financial covenants under certain of its debt obligations, which may mean lenders have the\nright to terminate their commitments under certain debt agreements and declare outstanding loans immediately due and payable.\nDiamond operates in a number of locations outside the United States and is subject to certain additional risks related to international operations\nthat are not applicable to our current business.\nDiamond manages resorts in and sells VOIs in countries outside of the United States, including in Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom and\nseveral countries in the European Union, which are subject to a number of risks, including compliance with local regulations and laws, regulations\nrestricting the sale of VOIs, compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, exposure to local economic\nconditions, potential adverse changes in the political or economic relation of foreign countries with the United States, withholding and restrictions on\ntaxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Diamond is and may in the future be subject to litigation in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn Mexico, the developer of certain of Diamond\u2019s resorts have agreed to requirements that they consider themselves as Mexican nationals with\nrespect to certain property and agree to not invoke the protection of their governments in matters relating to the property. Generally, rules in Mexico limit\nownership of land near Mexico\u2019s borders and beaches to Mexican citizens and companies, unless granted the right by the Mexican government. If the\ndeveloper of Diamond\u2019s resort in Mexico fails to comply with the agreement with the Mexican government, it would forfeit the land back to Mexico.\nWe do not currently have operations in several of the non-US jurisdictions in which Diamond operates and may lack knowledge or familiarity with\nthe rules and regulations, as well as experience and resources, related to operating such business in these countries.\nInterests in Diamond\u2019s resorts are offered through a trust system, which is subject to a number of regulatory and other requirements.\nThe Diamond Collections located in the United States are alternatives to traditional deeded timeshare ownership, inasmuch as they create a\nnetwork of available resort accommodations at multiple locations. For those United States-based Diamond Collections, title to the units available through\nthe Diamond Collections is held in a trust or similar arrangement that is administered by an independent trustee (the \u201cCollection Trustee\u201d). A purchaser of\na timeshare interest in a Collection does not receive a deeded interest in any specific resort or resort accommodation, but acquires a membership in the\ntimeshare plan which is denominated by an annual or biennial allotment of points. Owners of Diamond\u2019s timeshare interests are allowed to use their\nallocated points to reserve\n \n30\nTable of Contents\naccommodations at the various component site(s)/participating resort(s) within the Diamond Collections, thereby giving the members greater flexibility to\nplan their vacations. Owners may also elect to reserve accommodations at resorts that are not part of their Collection through Diamond\u2019s exchange\nprograms.\nThe Diamond Collections are registered pursuant to, exempted from, or otherwise in compliance with, the applicable statutory requirements for the\nsale of timeshare plans in a growing number of jurisdictions. Such registrations and formal exemption determinations for the Diamond Collections confirm\nthe substantial compliance with the filing and disclosure requirements of the respective timeshare statutes by the developer of the applicable Diamond\nCollection. It does not constitute the endorsement of the creation, sale, promotion or operation of the Diamond Collections by any regulatory body nor\nrelieve the developer of a Diamond Collection or any affiliates of such developer of any duty or responsibility under other statutes or any other\napplicable laws. Registration under a respective timeshare act (or other applicable law) is not a guarantee or assurance of compliance with applicable law\nnor an assurance or guarantee of how any judicial body may interpret the Diamond Collections\u2019 compliance therewith. A determination that specific\nprovisions or operations of the Collections do not comply with relevant timeshare acts or applicable law may have a material adverse effect on the\ndeveloper, the Collection Trustee and the related non-profit members association for each of the Diamond Collections.\nIncreased activity by third-party exit companies on Diamond and its owners may cause distractions and adversely impact our integration.\nDiamond and other timeshare companies continue to be significantly targeted by organized activities of third parties that actively pursue timeshare\nowners claiming to provide timeshare interest transfers and/or \u201cexit\u201d services. Any increases in the level of participation by the Diamond owners in\nresponse to such overtures and/or delinquencies or defaults with respect to the timeshare loans owed by such owners may disrupt Diamond\u2019s business,\naffect cash flow from collections on the timeshare loans, and generally adversely affect our integration plans of Diamond. In addition, exit companies may\ntarget HGV owners to a greater extent than they already do in light of the proposed merger with Diamond.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Hilton\nOur future results may suffer if Hilton seeks to modify or terminate the A&R Hilton license agreement.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Hilton under which we license substantially all of the trademarks, brand names and intellectual property\nused in our business. The A&R Hilton license agreement also permits us to utilize the Hilton Honors program, which is a valuable asset for lead\ngeneration. These assets are critical to our business and the modification or amendment the A&R Hilton license agreement or any exercise by Hilton of its\ntermination or other rights under the A&R Hilton license agreement will materially impact our business. The termination or amendment of the A&R Hilton\nlicense agreement in whole or in part could result in the loss of the right of HGV to use the Hilton brands in our business as currently conducted as well\nas in connection with our post-combination business, and in related services offered by Hilton, including marketing channels and guest loyalty programs.\nThe loss of such rights will materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our VOI products and maintain\nour competitive position, and will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, it is likely to be\nvery challenging for us to find or develop a comparable replacement for the Hilton brand and the A&R Hilton license agreement. In addition, we may\nincur liabilities if any such termination results from our alleged breach of the A&R Hilton license agreement.\nIf the A&R Hilton license agreement is terminated, we may lose our rights to certain brands developed by us in connection with the integration of the\nDiamond business.\nPursuant to the A&R Hilton license agreement, Hilton would be the sole owner of certain licensed marks related to new brands associated with the\nDiamond portfolio that are developed by us in connection with our\n \n31\nTable of Contents\npost-combination business. If, following the completion of the merger, we default under the A&R Hilton license agreement, we could lose the right to use\none or more of such new brands. The loss of these rights and/or certain other related rights could materially adversely affect our ability to generate\nrevenue and profits from the vacation ownership business associated with the Diamond portfolio. The termination of the A&R Hilton license agreement\nfollowing completion of the merger would materially harm our combined business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our\nproducts and maintain our competitive position.\nOur ability to integrate the Diamond business and otherwise expand our business and remain competitive could be harmed if Hilton does not\nconsent to the use of their trademarks in connection with the conversion of Diamond properties and/or new resorts that we may acquire or develop in\nthe future.\nUnder the terms of the A&R Hilton license agreement, we must obtain Hilton\u2019s approval to use the Hilton brand names and trademarks in\nconnection with the conversion of the Diamond properties to branded properties using the Hilton marks, as well as for the branding of timeshare\nproperties that we acquire or develop in the future. If Hilton does not permit us to use its trademarks in connection with such conversion and integration\non a timely basis or at all, or in connection with any other timeshare properties that we may acquire in the future pursuant to any future development or\nacquisition plans, or if we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and operate Diamond properties that are not approved by Hilton,\nour ability to successfully integrate Diamond and otherwise expand our business and remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. The\nrequirement to obtain approval for such conversion and integration of Diamond properties and any future expansion plans, or the need to identify and\nsecure alternative solutions because we cannot obtain such approval, may delay implementation of our integration and/or expansion plans or cause us to\nincur additional expense related to the branding of our properties.\nOur ability to integrate the Diamond business depends on our compliance with the A&R Hilton license agreement, including the \u201cSeparate\nOperations\u201d provisions and certain prohibitions on doing business with competitors. While the parties intend to provide some revisions to the\napplicable requirements, strict compliance with such provisions will negatively impact the synergies and efficiencies related to the Diamond\nacquisition.\nFor now, we have agreed with Hilton to operate the Diamond business as a \u201cSeparate Operation\u201d under the A&R Hilton license agreement.\nComplying with that requirement can be costly and difficult and will likely significantly diminish the efficiencies and synergies that are critical to our\nsuccessful integration of the Diamond business. In addition, the A&R Hilton license agreement requires Hilton\u2019s approval in connection with our\nanticipated conversion of the Diamond properties into our branded properties and/or Hilton Vacation Club or another new brand of properties, and the\ncreation of any such new brand also requires Hilton\u2019s consent. While we and Hilton have agreed to modify the Separate Operations requirements, with\nsuch modifications to be made in Hilton\u2019s sole discretion, so as to allow us to achieve greater operating efficiency and synergy than currently provided\nfor, any failure of the parties to do so will adversely impact such operating efficiency and synergy. In addition, any failure to obtain Hilton\u2019s approval with\nrespect to the creation of any new brand or the conversion of the Diamond properties into such new brand or existing branded properties will\nsignificantly harm our ability to integrate the Diamond business and its properties. If we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and\noperate Diamond properties that do not currently or will not in the future meet the Hilton brand standards, then we will be required to continue to operate\nthem as separate operations.\nIn addition, the A&R Hilton license agreement contains a number of prohibitions on us entering into certain agreements and arrangements with\ncompetitors of Hilton. As a result of the merger, we will assume Diamond\u2019s contracts with third parties, a number which are with competitors of Hilton and\nare prohibited under the A&R Hilton license agreement. The A&R Hilton license agreement provides for a cure period for agreements or arrangements\nrelated to the Diamond business that would result in a violation or breach of provisions in the A&R Hilton license agreement. However, to the extent we\nare not able to terminate such agreements within the cure period or we are unable to obtain a waiver from Hilton, we may breach the A&R Hilton license\nagreement.\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business\nYou should read and consider risk factors specific to our businesses that will also affect the combined company after the completion of the merger.\nThese risks are described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and Part II, Item IA of our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and in other documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.\nSee the section entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference\u201d beginning on page 155 of this proxy statement for the\nlocation of information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.\n \n33\nTable of Contents",

This\nproxy statement and the information incorporated by reference herein provides our stockholders with the information they need to know to be able to\nvote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting.\nDate, Time and Place\nThe special meeting is scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, on July 28, 2021 at 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Orlando, Florida 32839.\nPurpose of the HGV Special Meeting\nAt the special meeting, and any adjournments or postponements thereof, you will be asked to consider and vote on:\n \n \n\u2022\n the stock issuance proposal\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the compensation proposal\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock\nissuance proposal.\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors, after careful consideration of the various factors described under \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation\nof Our Board of Directors\u201d beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement, at a meeting held on March 8, 2021, unanimously determined that the merger\nagreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and\nin the best interests of us and our stockholders\u037e authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance of shares of our common stock in the\nmerger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by a unanimous vote\u037e and adopted resolutions directing that the stock issuance\nproposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration.\nIn evaluating the merger, our board of directors consulted with and received the advice of our outside legal and financial advisors, held discussions\nwith our management and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its decision to enter into the merger agreement. These factors\nincluded, but were not limited to, those listed in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of Our Board of Directors\u201d beginning on\npage 56 of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the stock issuance proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nIn relation to the compensation proposal, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to\nterminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger and, accordingly, we do not anticipate making any change in control payments,\naccelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to our other named executive officers as a result of the merger.\nRecord Date\u037e Stockholders Entitled to Vote\nOnly holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on June 1, 2021, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to\nnotice of, and to vote at, the special meeting, or any adjournment or\n \n38Table of Contents\npostponement thereof. At the close of business on the record date, 85,718,663 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and held by six\nholders of record. In addition, many brokers, banks and other institutions hold shares of common stock as nominees for beneficial owners that deposit\nthese shares of common stock in participant accounts at the Depository Trust Company.\nHolders of record of our common stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share at the special meeting on each proposal. A list of the\nnames of our stockholders of record will be open to the examination by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the special meeting for ten days\nbefore the special meeting during regular business hours at our headquarters, 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839. The HGV\nstockholder list will also be available at the special meeting for examination by any stockholder present at such meeting.\nVoting by our Directors and Executive Officers\nAt the close of business on the record date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote 1,483,245 shares of our common stock, or\napproximately 1.7% of the shares of our common stock outstanding on that date. We currently expect that all of our directors and executive officers will\nvote their shares in favor of each proposal being submitted to a vote of our stockholders at the special meeting, although none of them has entered into\nany agreement obligating them to do so.\nQuorum\nNo business may be transacted at the special meeting unless a quorum is present. The presence of the holders of a majority in voting power of the\nstock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is required to constitute a quorum for\nthe transaction of business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present, or if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to\napprove the stock issuance proposal, the special meeting may be adjourned to allow more time for obtaining additional proxies or votes. At any\nsubsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of\nthe special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn before the adjourned meeting.\nAbstentions (shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from voting) will be\nincluded in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum has been achieved. However, broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock represented\nat the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.\nRequired Vote\nThe approval of the stock issuance proposal and the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes\ncast. The approval of the adjournment proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the stockholders of a majority in voting\npower present if a quorum is not present, or, if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast. Failures to vote and\nbroker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the stock issuance proposal, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.\nFailure to Vote, Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions\nIf your shares of our common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d in a stock brokerage account or by another nominee, you must provide the record\nholder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other\nnominee. You may not vote shares of our common stock held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to HGV or by voting at the special meeting\nunless you provide a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d which you must first obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.\n \n39\nTable of Contents\nBanks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares of our common stock in street name for a beneficial owner typically have the authority to vote in\ntheir discretion on \u201croutine\u201d proposals, even when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers or other\nnominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are determined to be \u201cnon-routine\u201d without specific instructions from the\nbeneficial owner. A \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d is a vote that, in accordance with stock exchange rules, is not cast by a broker on a non-routine matter because the\nbank, broker or other nominee has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and the bank,\nbroker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.\nUnder the written rules of the NYSE, banks, brokers or other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals to be\nvoted upon at this special meeting. Therefore, if you are an HGV stockholder who holds shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not instruct your bank,\nbroker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares on any of these proposals, and the\nresulting broker non-vote will have no effect on these proposals.\nInstructions to \u201cABSTAIN\u201d for each proposal to be voted upon at the special meeting will be counted for purposes of determining the number of\nshares present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Abstentions will not be included in the vote totals for each proposal and will\nhave no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposals. If you return your signed proxy card but do not mark the boxes indicating how you wish to\nvote, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the stock issuance proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal, on an advisory basis, and, if necessary or\nappropriate, \u201cFOR\u201d any proposal to adjourn the special meeting.\nVoting at the Special Meeting\nWhether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote your shares. If you are a registered or \u201crecord\u201d holder, which means your shares\nare registered in your name with EQ Shareowner Services, our transfer agent, you may vote in person at the special meeting or be represented by proxy. If\nyour shares are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d which means your shares are held of record in an account with a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow\nthe instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote, and must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee in order\nto vote in person at the special meeting. Please contact your bank, broker or other nominee for further information on how to obtain such legal proxy. You\nwill not be able to vote your shares at the special meeting without a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not plan to attend the\nspecial meeting or do not wish to vote at the special meeting, you may authorize proxies to vote your shares by written proxy, by telephone or over the\ninternet.\nVoting by Proxy\nYou should vote your proxy in advance of the meeting even if you plan to attend the special meeting. If you are an HGV stockholder of record, a\nproxy card is enclosed for your use. If you wish to authorize proxies to vote your shares by telephone or over the internet, you may use the toll-free\ntelephone number or access the electronic link to the proxy voting site by following the instructions on the proxy card. Our stockholders of record may\nalso submit their proxies through the mail by completing the enclosed proxy card, and signing, dating and returning it in the enclosed, pre-addressed,\npostage-paid envelope. To be valid, a returned proxy card must be signed.\nIf you hold your shares of our common stock in street name (i.e., through a bank, broker or other nominee), you will find enclosed instructions from\nyour bank, broker or other nominee that you must follow in order to vote your shares. You may authorize proxies to vote your shares by telephone or\nover the internet if your bank, broker or other nominee makes these methods available, as detailed on the enclosed voting instruction form. You may also\nreturn your voting instructions by signing, dating and returning the enclosed voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided.\nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDINGLY, PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR PROXY PROMPTLY, BY TELEPHONE, INTERNET OR MAIL\nWHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING.\n \n40\nTable of Contents\nHow Proxies are Counted\nAll shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner specified by\nthe stockholders giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals\ncovered by this proxy statement.\nOnly shares affirmatively voted for the proposals, and properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions, will be counted as \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe proposals submitted by us as described in this proxy statement. Abstentions will not be included in the vote totals for each proposal and will have no\neffect on the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals. Failures to vote and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of any of the\nproposals.\nRevocation of Proxies\nYou can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record,\nyou can do this in one of three ways:\n \n \n\u2022\n you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date, including by telephone or through the internet before the closing of those voting\nfacilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n you can send a signed notice of revocation to Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., 5323 Millenia Lakes Boulevard, Suite 120, Orlando, Florida 32839,\nAttention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on July 27, 2021\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n you can attend and vote at the special meeting, which will revoke any proxy previously given. Simply attending the special meeting without\nvoting will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given or otherwise change your vote.\nA registered stockholder may revoke a proxy by any of these methods, regardless of the method used to deliver the stockholder\u2019s previous proxy.\nIf you are a \u201cbeneficial holder\u201d who holds shares of our common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to\nchange your vote. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you decide to change your vote by attending the special\nmeeting and voting in person at the special meeting, you will not be able to vote unless you have obtained and present a legal proxy issued in your name\nfrom the record holder (your bank, broker or nominee).\nTabulation of Votes\nA representative of Broadridge will serve as the Inspector of Election for the special meeting and will independently tabulate affirmative and\nnegative votes and abstentions.\nSolicitation of Proxies\nWe are soliciting proxies for the special meeting from our stockholders.

        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAfter our spin-off from Hilton in January 2017 to become an independent, publicly-traded company, our newly constituted board of directors and\nsenior management focused on ensuring appropriate corporate governance and board oversight, financial reporting, internal controls over financial\nreporting, investor communications, and other significant areas that are critical to the success of a new public company. With oversight from our board of\ndirectors, our senior management prioritized proper execution and management of our core business and fully leveraging our license arrangement with\nHilton. During the course of 2017 and early 2018, two of our significant stockholders, The Blackstone Group and its affiliates (\u201cBlackstone\u201d), which\nowned an aggregate of approximately 40% of our common stock immediately after the spin-off, and HNA Group and its affiliates (\u201cHNA\u201d), which owned\n24% of our common stock as a result of their purchase of our shares of common stock from Blackstone, sold all of their interests in us in multiple public\nofferings. As a result, one director who was designated by Blackstone and two directors (one independent and one affiliate) designated by HNA had\neither resigned from our board of directors or elected not to stand for re-election by May 2018.\nThereafter, our board of directors and senior management focused on the overall strategic direction of the company, and on an ongoing basis, our\nboard of directors and senior management team reviewed our performance and future growth prospects, and considered potential opportunities to\nstrengthen our businesses and enhance stockholder value, including the review of our strategy on a standalone basis and potential opportunities for\nbusiness combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives.\nStarting in the summer of 2019, as part of our ongoing strategic evaluation, we explored different potential strategic alternatives, including\nacquisitions, combinations, sale and similar transactions, and engaged in discussions with several interested parties, including with Apollo and Diamond.\nAs part of such discussions with Apollo and Diamond, Mr. Mark Wang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Michael Flaskey, Chief Executive\nOfficer of Diamond, and Mr. David Sambur, Co-Lead Partner of Private Equity at Apollo, considered our and Diamond\u2019s respective businesses, as well as\npotential opportunities, including a combination structure involving us and Diamond.\n \n43Table of Contents\nAs part of such discussion to explore a potential transaction, we, Apollo and Diamond entered into confidentiality agreements in September 2019.\nIn addition, we, together with BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA Securities\u201d), our financial advisor for such strategic evaluation, and our legal advisors, and\nApollo and Diamond, together with their financial and legal advisors, conducted due diligence of each other. Our discussions and mutual diligence with\nApollo and Diamond lasted through the end of 2019 and into March of 2020. At the time, our board of directors had selected BofA Securities to act as our\nfinancial advisor based on, among other things, its qualifications, expertise and reputation, and its knowledge of our business and affairs and familiarity\nwith us and the industry in which we operate. Among other experiences, BofA Securities had significant hospitality, gaming and real estate M&A and\ncapital markets experience. BofA Securities and its affiliates also had served as a key lead bank in our credit facility syndicate of banks and lead\nunderwriter under our ABS program. As part of such engagement, our board of directors evaluated whether BofA Securities had any material conflicts\nwith respect to the parties involved or potentially involved.\nWhile such discussions and strategic explorations were continuing, in late February 2020 and early March 2020, positive cases of the COVID-19\nvirus began to proliferate rapidly around the world. During the same period, global travel, leisure, hospitality, and other related sectors began to\nexperience significant disruptions due to the continued unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continued to spread, more and more\ncountries began to impose quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and similar restrictions, including restrictions on travel, which only exacerbated already\nsignificant disruptions on the global health, social, economic, and political sectors. Between mid-February 2020 through March 2020, the global stock\nmarkets began to experience significant volatility due to the pandemic and its widespread impact. On March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n(\u201cDJIA\u201d) lost more than 2,000 points in one day, the biggest one-day drop in its history. In barely four trading days, the DJIA plunged 6,400 points, an\nequivalent to approximately 26% of the total market value. Foreign stock markets experienced similar drops and volatility, including London\u2019s FTSE 100\nwhich lost more than 7.7% in one trading day.\nThe pandemic triggered a worldwide health, financial and economic crisis, including in the United States. During the ensuing months, as more and\nmore U.S. local and state government agencies adopted quarantine and similar orders, a substantial number of hospitality, travel, and leisure businesses\nwere forced to shut down.\nThe impact on our business and our stock price was no less severe. Our stock price dropped more than 68% from $32.97 on February 14, 2020, prior\nto the onset of the pandemic, to $10.53 on March 18, 2020. By the end of April 2020, in response to the pandemic and the governmental quarantine and\nsimilar orders, we closed virtually all of our properties and sales center operations. Like many other companies, we began to take a number of significant\nsteps to preserve our business and liquidity in response to the pandemic and protect our stockholders, including drawing on our available amounts\nunder our credit facility to maximize liquidity, making significant cuts to capital and inventory spending, amending our credit and warehouse facilities to\nprovide temporary relief from financial and other covenant compliance, implementing furloughs and, eventually, workforce reductions, implementing\nsalary cuts, including for our executive officers and directors, and adopting a stockholder rights plan. Our focus rapidly pivoted to safeguarding our\nowners, guests and team members, and, eventually, re-opening properties, sales locations and offices while protecting our owners, guests and team\nmembers, while implementing steps to create incremental value, including repeat owner sales with new inventory offerings, preservation of future tours\nby extending travel dates, ongoing work on new product offerings and partnerships, and expansion of our new virtual sales model. Accordingly, during\nthis time, we ceased all review and exploration of, and discussions with third parties regarding potential strategic alternatives, financing and similar\ntransactions.\nAs we began to re-open our properties, sales locations and offices in early June 2020 and worked towards returning to more normal business\noperations and conditions, Mr. Wang and the rest of our senior management team evaluated our strategic and capital allocation goals and options,\nincluding the possible acquisition of Diamond. Mr. Wang believed that combining our and Diamond\u2019s businesses could help further drive our business to\nreturn to growth and achieve faster recovery from the pandemic in light of the complementary mix of\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nproperties between the two companies and resort locations. In early June, Mr. Wang discussed with representatives from BofA Securities the possibility\nof us acquiring Diamond. Shortly thereafter, BofA Securities contacted Mr. Sambur on our behalf to gauge Apollo\u2019s interest in selling all of the Apollo\nInvestors\u2019 interests in Diamond to us, with Mr. Sambur indicating that he would be interested in exploring such a transaction.\nOn June 9, 2020, Mr. Sambur presented to Mr. Wang Apollo\u2019s preliminary thoughts on a hypothetical all-stock combination transaction involving\nHGV and Diamond that could potentially create significant value for both companies\u2019 stockholders and achieve certain synergies on a combined basis.\nBeing keenly aware of the disruption that the pandemic had caused in the travel, leisure and lodging sectors, they agreed there could be potential added\nbenefits of combining the two companies once the severity of the pandemic receded and consumers re-commenced leisure travel. Afterwards, Mr. Wang\nand the rest of our senior management discussed with BofA Securities the possibility of our acquisition of Diamond, potential valuation, and structure.\nBetween June 19, 2020 and June 25, 2020, our senior management met with representatives of BofA Securities numerous times to discuss the\npotential acquisition, synergies, capital structure, and diligence involving Diamond.\nBased on such discussions, on June 25, 2020, BofA Securities, on our behalf, presented to Apollo an illustrative transaction structure whereby we\nwould acquire 100% of the equity interest in Diamond in an all-stock transaction in exchange for approximately 29% of the total ownership in the\ncombined company representing an equity value of approximately $935.0 million at the then-current trading price comprised of an upfront payment in our\ncommon stock valued at $497.0 million for approximately 22% equity interest, plus deferred contingent payment of $438.0 million for an additional 7%\nequity interest in the form of warrants or similar instruments, which would be payable in a series of tranches when our stock price crosses certain\nthresholds, for 50% of the value of the expected cost synergy. Such structure and potential consideration were based on limited financial information and\nprior to any formal financial or legal diligence, and were intended for further discussion and evaluation purposes only.\nBetween June 26, 2020 and July 31, 2020, our senior management continued to meet with representatives of BofA Securities numerous times to\ndiscuss the potential acquisition involving Diamond.\nOn August 5, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting, our board of directors met with representatives of our senior management to discuss the state\nof the timeshare industry during the pandemic, the potential recovery timeline, a potential acquisition of Diamond, and other potential value-creating\nopportunities with respect to an acquisition involving Diamond. Following discussion, our board of directors agreed our senior management should\ncontinue to explore such an opportunity with Apollo and Diamond\u2019s management.\nOn August 11, 2020, our senior management informed senior management of Hilton that we were considering a potential acquisition of Diamond.\nOur senior management and the senior management of Hilton discussed the strategic merits and risks of the proposed transaction. Among other matters,\nwe discussed Hilton\u2019s consent that would be required under the license agreement for the acquisition, and the need to explore certain modification to the\ncurrent license agreement to allow us to achieve desired synergy and value in connection such potential transaction.\nOn August 14, 2020, our senior management, BofA Securities, and certain representatives of Apollo held a telephone conference to discuss\npreliminary scope of due diligence, including our initial critical request list.\nShortly afterwards, on August 18, 2020, our senior management, BofA Securities, representatives of Apollo, and senior management of Diamond\nheld a call to discuss an overview of our rebranding and brand integration planning and strategy as part of any acquisition of Diamond by us.\nStarting on August 21, 2020, we and BofA Securities were given access to Diamond\u2019s electronic data room. Our senior management, certain of our\nsenior team members who were privy to such evaluation, and BofA Securities commenced financial diligence of Diamond based on available information\nin the data room.\n \n45\nTable of Contents\nBetween August 27, 2020 and September 25, 2020, certain representatives from our senior management, Apollo, Diamond, BofA Securities, and\nCredit Suisse, financial advisor to Diamond, participated in a number of telephonic meetings to continue our discussions on exploring a possible\nacquisition transaction and covered a number of topics, including operational and financial diligence, financial projections, valuations and potential\nsynergies.\nOn September 23, 2020, as we continued our discussions with Apollo and Diamond, Diamond provided us with financial forecasts through the\nelectronic data room for our review and evaluation. Our senior management reviewed the materials, together with other existing materials, and continued\nto discuss the potential valuation and feasibility of a transaction with representatives of BofA Securities.\nOn October 5, 2020, our senior management met again with senior management of Hilton to present our rebranding and repositioning strategy to\nintegrate Diamond. During the meeting, we discussed the potential that the transaction might cause our timeshare business to grow, to the benefit of both\nHGV and Hilton. We also discussed a \u201cramp-up\u201d of the license fee under the Hilton license agreement that would be applicable with respect to the\nintegration of the Diamond business into our platform.\nOn October 9, 2020, our board of directors discussed via teleconference with our senior management and representatives of BofA Securities to\nreceive an update from our senior management and BofA Securities regarding general strategic and financial considerations relating to a potential\nacquisition of Diamond and related discussions with Apollo and Diamond. Our senior management discussed with our board of directors preliminary\nstrategic and economic rationales, as well as potential risks, for pursuing such acquisition. In addition, our senior management, together with\nrepresentatives from BofA Securities, provided to our board of directors an overview of the Diamond projections, our and BofA Securities\u2019 preliminary\nrevisions to such projections, our projections, and preliminary valuation of Diamond. In addition, based on such preliminary evaluation, our senior\nmanagement presented an overview of a potential all-stock acquisition of Diamond at an equity value of approximately $840.0 million, comprised of\nupfront and deferred contingent payments. Our board of directors agreed that our senior management should continue to explore a possible acquisition\nof Diamond and to submit a preliminary, non-binding proposal to Apollo reflecting such structure.\nOn October 19, 2020, BofA Securities presented to Apollo and Credit Suisse a non-binding proposal on behalf of HGV regarding a potential\nacquisition by us of 100% of the equity interests of Diamond in an all-stock transaction whereby the former Diamond stockholders would own an\naggregate of approximately 28% of the total ownership in the combined company (representing an equity value of approximately $838.0 million at the\nthen-current trading price), comprised of an upfront payment in our common stock valued at $466.0 million for approximately 20% equity interest, plus a\ndeferred contingent payment of $372.0 million for an additional 8% equity interest in the form of warrants or similar instruments for 50% of the value of the\nexpected cost synergy. As an alternative, the warrants could be payable in a series of tranches when our stock price crossed certain thresholds.\nIn addition, on October 19, 2020, our senior management again met with senior management of Hilton during which our senior management\npresented a preliminary ramp-up license fee structure proposal with respect to the Diamond acquisition during the integration of the Diamond business\nand other related matters, and discussed Hilton\u2019s consent that would be required under the license agreement for the acquisition.\nOn October 23, 2020, our senior management held a telephonic call with representatives from Apollo and Diamond to discuss both companies\u2019\nprojections, business prospects, and potential cost and revenue synergies.\nThroughout October 2020, our senior management continued to refine synergy assumptions, Hilton license fee modeling, and rebranding strategy.\nWe responded to information requests from Apollo, Diamond, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, Diamond\u2019s tax and accounting advisor, as well\nas Hilton. We also made information and diligence requests to Apollo, Diamond and its advisors. During this time, our senior\n \n46\nTable of Contents\nmanagement also engaged in discussions with BofA Securities regarding financial and cost synergies of the transaction, as well as debt financing\nstrategy to consummate the Diamond acquisition, including bridge financing.\nOn November 3, 2020, at a regularly scheduled meeting, our board of directors met with our senior management to discuss further updates on\ndiscussions between us and Apollo and Diamond regarding our potential acquisition of Diamond.\nOn November 10, 2020, Diamond and Credit Suisse presented certain updates to Diamond\u2019s forecast of 2022 adjusted EBITDA and explained the\nbasis for such changes to our senior management and BofA Securities, noting that such changes were being principally driven by changes in their own\nprojections based on favorable recovery trends from the pandemic disruptions. Our senior management and BofA Securities continued to discuss and\nevaluate such changes presented by Diamond, including forming their own independent views of the recovery trends and basis for such changes in the\nDiamond projections.\nOn November 15, 2020, Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, delivered a non-binding proposal for a transaction whereby we would acquire\nDiamond for a consideration to be comprised of a combination of our common stock and $250.0 million of convertible notes with a 25% conversion\npremium. In exchange, assuming full conversion of the convertible notes, the former Diamond stockholders would own approximately 37% of our\noutstanding shares of common stock (having an equity value of approximately $1.22 billion). The shares of our common stock to be issued upfront would\nbe equal to approximately 33% of our outstanding stock after the transaction (having an equity value of approximately $1.039 billion based on our stock\u2019s\nvolume weighed average price for a 2 week-period prior to the date of the offer), plus an additional 4% of our outstanding stock after the transaction\n(having an additional equity value of approximately $183.0 million) assuming full conversion of the convertible notes.\nOn November 17, 2020, Mr. Wang and Mr. Sambur spoke about the November 15 proposal and the November 10 forecast. Subsequently, on\nNovember 20, 2020, Mr. Wang received from Mr. Sambur certain supplemental information with respect to the November 10 forecast. Our senior\nmanagement and BofA Securities continued to discuss and evaluate such changes, together with such additional information provided by Diamond, and\ncontinued to form and apply their own independent views for the basis of such changes and the supplemental information.\nAfter further discussion with BofA Securities and internal discussions and evaluation, our senior management authorized BofA Securities to inform\nApollo that we were not willing to proceed on the terms outlined in the November 15 offer and instead instructed BofA Securities to present, on\nNovember 30, 2020, a counteroffer to Apollo of a transaction whereby the former Diamond stockholders would own approximately 29% of our\noutstanding shares of common stock (having an equity value of approximately $975.0 million at the then-current market price), but with no convertible\nnote feature. This counteroffer was reiterated by Mr. Wang directly to Mr. Sambur via telephone conversation on November 30.\nOn December 4, 2020, our senior management met again with Hilton\u2019s senior management to present a revised license fee structure proposal with\nrespect to the Diamond acquisition. Among other items, the proposal reflected the ramp-up fee structure over the initial five-year period following the\nclosing of the transaction based on sales of new brand club membership and property revenues associated with Diamond properties that convert into\nHGV/Hilton licensed properties.\nOn December 6, 2020, we received from Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, a counteroffer to our November 30 offer that reflected the former\nDiamond stockholders acquiring approximately a 33% interest in our company upon the closing of the transaction (having an equity value of\napproximately $1.20 billion at the then-current market price). Subsequently, on December 8, 2020, Mr. Wang spoke to Mr. Sambur about the latest\ncounteroffer and indicated that we were unwilling to proceed or continue our discussions based on such valuation.\n \n47\nTable of Contents\nOn December 11, 2020, our senior management, Diamond\u2019 senior management, and representatives from BofA Securities and Credit Suisse held a\ntelephone meeting to discuss certain preliminary financing considerations in connection with a possible transaction, including scope and structure of\npotential financing alternatives.\nOn December 14, 2020, Credit Suisse, on behalf of Diamond, presented an updated version of its December 6 counteroffer that reflected the former\nDiamond stockholders acquiring approximately a 31% interest in our company (having an equity value of approximately $1.115 billion at the then-current\nmarket price). Apollo also proposed an alternative financing structure whereby all existing indebtedness of HGV and Diamond would remain outstanding\nafter the transaction other than the redemption of our outstanding $300.0 million senior notes, for which the Apollo Funds would provide a backstop to\neliminate our need for bridge financing. However, after diligence, we concluded that it would not be feasible nor desirable to have all of Diamond\u2019s\nindebtedness remain outstanding after the transaction due to a number of reasons, including change in control and similar triggers, unfavorable pricing,\nand terms of such indebtedness. Apollo and Credit Suisse also provided an estimated timeline for completing all financial and legal due diligence and\npotential signing of a definitive agreement.\nAfter evaluation and consultation with our advisors, including with BofA Securities, on December 15, 2020, our senior management responded to\nApollo with a non-binding, \u201cbest and final\u201d offer of an all-stock acquisition that would result in the former Diamond stockholders acquiring approximately\na 29.7% interest in the combined company (reflecting an equity value of approximately $1.05 billion at the then-current market price) upon the closing of\nthe transaction. Apollo preliminarily accepted the offer, subject to continued diligence by both parties. Afterwards, the parties agreed to accelerate their\nrespective financial and legal diligence efforts and, subject to our board of directors\u2019 concurrence, work towards a definitive agreement on an expedited\nbasis.\nOn December 18, 2020, our senior management met with representatives of PJT Partners, a financial advisor that we had retained to assist us in\nexploring different financing alternatives, to discuss potential debt structures for the transaction. Subsequently, our senior management continued to\nexplore various financing structures and alternatives for the transaction in parallel to our discussions with Apollo regarding our acquisition of Diamond.\nOn December 22, 2020, a special meeting was convened for our board of directors at which our senior management and representatives of BofA\nSecurities updated the board on the recent discussions and negotiations with Apollo and Diamond that culminated with the non-binding offer on\nDecember 15. After consideration, our board of directors instructed management to continue exploring a possible transaction on the terms outlined in the\nDecember 15 proposal. BofA Securities summarized for our board of directors the process to date and the likely timeline leading to a definitive acquisition\nagreement. Both our senior management and BofA Securities also updated our board of directors on a detailed review of Diamond and the strategic and\nfinancial considerations of a transaction, as well as the diligence efforts expended to date and the expected expansion and acceleration of the overall\ntimeline for completing all diligence. At the special meeting, Mr. Charles R. Corbin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, reviewed with our board\nits fiduciary duties with regard to its evaluation of a possible acquisition transaction involving Diamond.\nStarting on December 30, 2020, our senior management and other team members, BofA Securities, and our legal advisors, Alston & Bird LLP\n(\u201cAlston & Bird\u201d), Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (\u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d), and Foley & Lardner LLP (\u201cFoley\u201d), as well as our independent auditor and tax\nconsultant, Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cE&Y\u201d), were provided access to Diamond\u2019s electronic diligence data room, conducted a substantial amount of diligence,\nand engaged in a series of diligence conference calls with representatives from Apollo, Diamond, Credit Suisse, and Apollo\u2019s and Diamond\u2019s outside legal\nadvisors, including Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d).\nBetween December 30, 2020 and March 5, 2021, we and our financial, legal, and accounting and tax advisors held over forty separate due diligence\ncalls with representatives of Apollo, Diamond, and their financial,\n \n48\nTable of Contents\nlegal, and accounting and tax advisors lasting up to several hours per call. During these calls, the parties discussed and covered a number of different\nareas of Diamond\u2019s business and the Apollo Funds\u2019 ownership in Diamond, including topics pertaining to treasury, inventory and rental activities,\naccounting and financial, resort operations and HOAs, sales and marketing, business operations, loan portfolio, IT infrastructure, call center and\nmarketing, US and foreign tax, labor, employment and human resources, financial accounting, software, legal, consumer licensing and regulatory,\nsecuritization and debt capital, and property and development.\nDuring a portion of the same period, Apollo\u2019s principals, Diamond\u2019s senior management, and their financial, legal and accounting and tax advisors\nconducted their own additional business and legal diligence of us and, between January 11, 2021 and February 9, 2021, they and we and our advisors held\nseveral \u201creverse\u201d due diligence calls regarding our business.\nBeginning in late December 2020, our senior management and our outside legal advisors began to prepare a draft merger agreement for the\ntransaction contemplated by the December 15 proposal.

It also did not contain any type of restriction on our ability to solicit transactions involving an acquisition of HGV.

Among other items, the term sheet addressed board and governance rights, transfer restrictions, preemptive rights,\nregistration rights, and consent rights, but did not include standstill or noncompetition provisions. All of these topics were the subject of numerous\ndiscussions and negotiations among the parties in the next several weeks.\nOn January 20, 2021, BofA Securities provided to us a proposal for a $2.3 billion of debt financing commitment for the transaction, which our senior\nmanagement began to review and evaluate.\nOn January 21, 2021, our senior management and senior management of Hilton met in person to discuss and tentatively agreed to the final\neconomic terms of the previously discussed ramp-up license fee structure for the integration of the Diamond properties.\nOn January 23, 2021, Paul Weiss provided to us comments to the draft merger agreement. In Paul Weiss\u2019s draft, Apollo proposed a \u201cpublic\ncompany\u201d style agreement, with no adjustment to the purchase price for working capital, transaction expenses, debt or other liabilities at Diamond unlike\nthe January 15 draft merger agreement that Simpson Thacher had provided. Also, Paul Weiss\u2019s draft did not include an indemnity construct. These\nproposals were the subject of numerous discussions and negotiations among the parties in the coming weeks leading up to the signing of a definitive\nagreement.\n \n49\nTable of Contents\nOur senior management, BofA Securities and our outside legal advisors engaged in a number of discussions and analysis regarding the key issues\nand positions of Apollo and their advisors as reflected in the January 23 comments to the merger agreement. Concurrently, our legal advisors continued\nto revise the draft merger agreement and prepare a draft stockholders agreement. During this time, we, our senior management, and our outside advisors\ncontinued to conduct various diligence of Diamond and Apollo.\nAt the same time, our senior management, together with BofA Securities and PJT Partners, continued to evaluate various debt financing\nalternatives and work towards securing necessary debt commitments for the transaction. In furtherance of such effort, on January 26, 2021, our senior\nmanagement requested proposals from several financial institutions (Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Truist) for debt financing commitments for the\ntransaction, to which we received preliminary term sheets and financing strategies from such parties on January 29, 2021.

Mr. Wang also noted to Mr. Sambur that, while we were open to continuing to negotiate and discuss such items, it was critical from\nour board of directors\u2019 and management\u2019s perspective to continue to focus on our year-end\n \n50\nTable of Contents\nmatters, particularly given the number of significant gaps that remained on the parties\u2019 negotiations.

As such, our board of directors authorized and approved the merger agreement, the issuance of\nshares of our common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby by a unanimous vote of its directors, and adopted resolutions\ndirecting that the stock issuance proposal be submitted to our stockholders for their consideration. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously\nrecommends that HGV stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the stock issuance proposal.\nHGV\u2019s board of directors considered many reasons in making its decision to approve the merger agreement and the issuance of shares of our\ncommon stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and in making its recommendation to the HGV stockholders that they\napprove the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger. In arriving at its decision, our board of directors consulted with our senior\nmanagement, legal advisors, financial advisors and other advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information, and concluded in its business judgment\nthat the proposed merger is likely to result in significant strategic and financial benefits to HGV and its stockholders, including the following anticipated\nbenefits (which are not exclusive or listed in any relative order of importance):\nPotentially Positive Considerations\n \n \n\u2022\n Combining HGV and Diamond would create a leading vacation ownership company with locations in key destinations and create a more\nglobally diversified company, with increased scale, geographic presence, diversity of revenue streams and product offerings, particularly as\nthe travel and leisure industry continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n HGV and Diamond have historically focused on different customer pools, and acquiring Diamond will allow HGV to dramatically expand its\npotential customer base\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation that HGV would achieve a minimum of $125 million of targeted annual cost synergies by leveraging operational and general\nand administrative cost efficiencies\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation that the merger will increase recurring EBITDA streams and drive overall cash flow, with adjusted free cash flow per share\naccretion in year one (excluding one-time transaction-related expenses)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation that adding a new brand within HGV as part of the Diamond integration represents a strong strategic fit in conjunction with\nHilton generated opportunities and enhances our ability to capitalize on leads and tours sourced from Hilton\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation that adding the Hilton Vacations Club Brand to the Diamond portfolio of resorts will add significant credibility and enhance\nthe value of the Diamond portfolio and existing owners within the existing Diamond business\u037e\n \n56Table of Contents\n \n\u2022\n The expectation that the merger will accelerate the launch of a HGV-branded trust product offering by rebranding Diamond\u2019s trust, Club, and\nproperties to drive further revenue growth in a new customer segment\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation that the free cash flow from the combined businesses after the merger would be strong and allow for us to advance further\ngrowth prospects, enhance stockholder returns and/or repay debt\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The expectation of sales growth with respect to Diamond\u2019s vacation ownership business and properties, and potential for further\nimprovement when combined with opportunities provided by our agreements with Hilton\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The fact that Hilton has provided its irrevocable consent as required under the Hilton license agreement (subject to certain limited\nconditions), and we and Hilton have entered into the A&R license agreement and other arrangements that will facilitate our integration of\nDiamond\u2019s business and properties, as more fully described in \u201cOther Agreements\u2014Hilton Agreements and Consent\u201d beginning on page\n109 of this proxy statement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The fact that because the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the merger agreement is fixed (with certain\nadjustments) and will not be adjusted for fluctuations in the market price of shares of our common stock, we have greater certainty as to the\nnumber of shares of our common stock to be issued in the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Based on our outstanding shares as of June 1, 2021, our stockholders would own approximately 72% of the combined company on a fully\ndiluted basis immediately following the closing of the merger and, therefore, will continue to participate in potential appreciation in equity\nvalue of the combined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The continuity of our board of directors and their familiarity with, and understanding of, our company and the timeshare industry, as\naugmented by the expected addition of two members designated by Apollo, which will only add to our board of directors\u2019 understanding\nand knowledge of Diamond and add additional experience with the timeshare industry\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The oral opinion of BofA Securities to our board of directors on March 8, 2021, and the written opinion of BofA Securities to our board of\ndirectors, dated March 9, 2021, and related financial analysis presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors on such dates, to the\neffect that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the\nmerger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to us. A copy of that written opinion is included as\nAnnex B to this proxy statement and described under \u201c\u2014Opinion of our Financial Advisor,\u201d beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The belief of our board of directors, following consultation with our senior management, and based in part upon the debt financing\ncommitments that we obtained, that it was likely that we would be able to obtain the necessary financing to refinance our debt and existing\nDiamond indebtedness, if necessary, and that after the completion of the merger, HGV would be able to repay and service any indebtedness\nthat is expected to form the interim or permanent financing of the merger and, with respect to such indebtedness, to comply with the\nfinancial covenants applicable to such indebtedness, after its review and discussion of various factors, including the expected terms of the\nproposed interim and permanent financing for the merger (including fees and interest)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The fact that Diamond\u2019s remedy in the event we are not able to obtain the proceeds of our committed debt financing in connection with the\nmerger could be limited to a reverse termination fee of $73.5 million\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The terms and conditions of the merger agreement reflect our and Diamond\u2019s commitment to closing\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The ability of our board of directors, under certain circumstances, to make a change in their recommendation of the merger agreement in\nresponse to certain intervening events favorable to us\u037e\n \n57\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n The fact that the merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the shares of HGV common stock, and that stockholders have\nthe ability to reject the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n We purchased a representation and warranty insurance policy in connection with Diamond\u2019s representations and warranties in the merger\nagreement and obtained certain indemnities from the Apollo Investors, which protects us against certain downside risk\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The terms of the transaction were heavily negotiated over the course of a long period of discussions with an Apollo affiliate, and the Apollo\naffiliate agreed to price and post-closing recourse terms that our board of directors thought were attractive\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The fact that Apollo is a sophisticated investor and Apollo\u2019s willingness to have the Apollo Funds invest in the combined company by\ntaking stock consideration, which our board of directors viewed as validation of the combined company\u2019s prospects\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Apollo agreed to certain company favorable governance terms under the stockholders agreement, including (a) limited approval rights and\n(b) a standstill and our ability to adopt a poison pill that would prevent the Apollo Funds from acquiring control of the combined company\nwithout negotiating with the full board of directors of the combined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Our ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the merger agreement, to engage in discussions with a third party that was interested\nin acquiring HGV or the combined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Apollo agreed to certain restrictions in the stockholders agreement on the manner and timing of the Apollo Funds\u2019 ability to exit HGV stock,\nand such restrictions could be favorable to our stockholders\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n The merger agreement includes a condition that we will not be obligated to close the merger if a material adverse effect on Diamond has\noccurred and is continuing.\nPotentially Negative Considerations\nIn the course of its deliberations, our board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative\nconsiderations relevant to the transaction, including the following (which are not exclusive or listed in any relative order of importance):\n \n \n\u2022\n The restrictions on the conduct of our business during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the completion of the\nmerger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The costs associated with completing the merger and realizing the benefits we expect to obtain in connection with the merger, including\nmanagement\u2019s time and energy and potential opportunity cost\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The challenges in absorbing the effect of any failure to complete the merger, including potential termination fees and stockholder and market\nreactions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The potential earnings dilution to our stockholders following the closing of the merger if synergies are not achieved\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Our stockholders, who currently own all of the equity interests in HGV, will own approximately 72% of the equity interest in the combined\ncompany on a fully diluted basis (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The challenges inherent in combining two businesses of the size and complexity of HGV and Diamond, including the possible diversion of\nmanagement and employee attention for an extended period of time\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The potential for diversion of management and employee attention during the period before completion of the merger, and the potential\nnegative effects on our and our combined company\u2019s business\u037e\n \n58\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n The extent to which our increased leverage could result in restrictions on our uses of cash, which could cause us to reduce capital\nexpenditures, limit financing offered to customers (which could result in reduced sales) and dedicate an unsustainable level of its cash flow\nfrom operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that certain provisions in certain of our and Diamond\u2019s contracts may constrain or delay the timing for realizing, operational and\ndevelopment plans, synergies, cost savings and other anticipated benefits expected to result from a combination of us and Diamond\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that regulatory agencies may object to and challenge the merger or may impose terms and conditions in order to resolve those\nobjections that adversely affect our financial results on a combined basis\u037e see the section entitled \u201c\u2014Regulatory Clearances Required for\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Hilton\u2019s right to terminate or take other actions with respect to the A&R license agreement with us following the consummation of the\nmerger if we fail to comply with its terms as we integrate the Diamond business\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Hilton\u2019s ability to revoke its consent of the merger in the event that the merger agreement is materially amended or the final form of the\nstockholders agreement is modified between the date of the merger agreement and the closing\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement and Diamond\u2019s ability to terminate the agreement and seek payment of a\ntermination fee in the event we are not able to obtain the proceeds of our committed debt financing in connection with the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The potential that the fixed exchange ratio under the merger agreement could result in us delivering greater value to Diamond stockholders\nthan had been anticipated by HGV should the value of the shares of our common stock increase from the date of the execution of the merger\nagreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that the travel and leisure industry will not recover as quickly or as much as we expect or would hope from the COVID-19 pandemic,\nor that the pandemic will continue to cause significant disruptions and adverse effect on our business, Diamond\u2019s business, the travel and\nleisure industry, and the global economy in general, making it very difficult for us to achieve positive benefits from the merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk of significant decline in value of Diamond\u2019s business during the period between signing and closing\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that the Apollo Funds exit the stock of the combined company which could drive down the share price of the stock of the\ncombined company\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that adding two members to the board of directors of the combined company could alter the dynamics of the board of directors in\nunproductive ways\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that Diamond employees may not successfully integrate into our culture\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that our existing customers may not accept or use the Diamond properties as part of our overall network of properties after the\nintegration\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that an Apollo affiliate may end up competing with the combined company through other investments\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n The risk that our stockholders will be diluted in the short term before expected synergies are achieved\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Acquirors often face a decline in their stock price immediately post-announcement.\nFurther, our board of directors considered that some members of our board of directors and certain executive officers may have interests in the\nproposed merger as individuals that are in addition to, and that may\n \n59\nTable of Contents\nbe different from, the interest of our stockholders generally, as described under \u201c\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 73 of this proxy statement.\nAfter considering the factors described above, our board of directors unanimously concluded that the potentially positive reasons relating to the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of shares of our common stock to Diamond stockholders,\noutweighed the potentially negative reasons.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by our board of directors is not exhaustive but is intended to reflect the\nmaterial reasons considered by our board of directors in its evaluation of the merger. In view of the complexity, and the large number, of the reasons\nconsidered, our board of directors, both individually and collectively, did not find it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or assign any relative\nor specific weight to the various reasons. Rather, our board of directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and\nconsidered by it. In addition, individual members of our board of directors may have given different weight to different reasons.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by our board of directors is forward-looking in nature. This information\nshould be read in light of the reasons described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page 22 of this proxy statement and \u201cSpecial Note About Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement.\nOpinion of Our Financial Advisor\nHGV has retained BofA Securities to act as HGV\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Securities is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated\nunderwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. As\npreviously noted, HGV selected BofA Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Securities\u2019 experience in\ntransactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community, and its familiarity with HGV, Diamond, and their respective businesses, and\nits significant hospitality, gaming and real estate M&A and capital markets experience.\nOn March 8, 2021, at a meeting of HGV\u2019s board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Securities delivered to HGV\u2019s board of directors an\noral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 9, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to\nvarious assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to HGV.\nOn April 8, 2021, HGV notified BofA Securities that the Net Synergies/Cost Savings (as defined below) used by BofA Securities in connection with\nits fairness opinion should have assumed only the synergies that would be achieved subsequent to the anticipated closing of the transaction of July 1,\n2021, rather than a January 1, 2021 closing. Specifically, the estimated cost savings for fiscal year 2021 should have been stated as $25 million rather than\n$59 million as reflected in the Net Synergies/Cost Savings. Consequently, (i) BofA Securities\u2019 discounted cash flow analysis using the original Net\nSynergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below, resulted in a range of implied equity value for Diamond of $1,260 million to $1,950 million instead of\n$1,230 million to $1,930 million, and (ii) BofA Securities\u2019 pro forma relative ownership analysis based on discounted cash flow using the original Net\nSynergy/Cost Savings estimates, as described below, resulted in a range of pro forma ownership by Diamond\u2019s shareholders of the combined company of\n22.2% to 38.6% instead of 21.8% to 38.4%. On April 9, 2021, BofA Securities confirmed in writing to HGV\u2019s board of directors that had BofA Securities\nissued its opinion on the basis of the actual Net Synergies/Cost Savings, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in such opinion.\nThe full text of the written opinion of BofA Securities to the HGV board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\n \n60\nTable of Contents\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of the written opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to the HGV board of directors for the benefit and use of the HGV\nboard of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration provided for in the merger\nfrom a financial point of view.

With respect to the Diamond Forecasts, BofA Securities were advised by Diamond,\nand BofA Securities assumed with the consent of HGV, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best available estimates and good faith\njudgments of the management of Diamond as to the future financial performance of Diamond. With respect to the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, the HGV\nForecasts and the Net Synergies/Cost Savings, BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of HGV, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting\nthe best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of HGV as to the future financial performance of Diamond and HGV and the\nother matters covered thereby and, based on the assessments of the management of HGV as to the relative likelihood of achieving the future financial\nresults reflected in the Diamond Forecasts and the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, BofA Securities relied, at the direction of HGV, on the Adjusted\nDiamond Forecasts for purposes of its opinion. BofA Securities relied, at the direction of HGV, on the assessments of the management of HGV as to\nHGV\u2019s ability to achieve the Net Synergies/Cost Savings and were advised by HGV, and assumed, that the Net Synergies/Cost Savings will be realized in\nthe amounts and at the times projected. BofA Securities did not make, nor were they provided with, any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets\nor liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Diamond or HGV, nor did BofA Securities make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Diamond or\nHGV. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Diamond or HGV under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without\nwaiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,\nregulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture\nrequirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Diamond, HGV or the contemplated benefits of the\nmerger. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the merger will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization under the\nprovisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of HGV, that the final\nexecuted merger agreement did not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.\nBofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger consideration to\nthe extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any adjustments to the merger\nconsideration, or any terms, aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to\nthe merger or otherwise.

BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for Diamond and\nfour publicly traded companies in the timeshare industry. BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded\ncompanies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on March 5, 2021, plus debt, plus preferred stock, plus minority interest, and less\ncash and cash equivalents, as a multiple of calendar year 2019 and estimated calendar year 2022 (which years were selected by BofA Securities in an effort\nto analyze financial characteristics of Diamond unaffected by COVID-19) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization, unburdened for\nnet construction deferrals, non-operating gains, share-based compensation expenses and one-time, non-recurring expenses including impairment\nexpenses, which is consistent with the management of HGV\u2019s methodology and which is referred to herein as Adj. EBITDA. The mean and median\nenterprise value / calendar year 2019 Adj. EBITDA multiple observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 9.4x and 9.0x, respectively, and the\nmean and median enterprise value / estimated calendar year 2022 Adj.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances\nand, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses\nsummarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or\nfocusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been\nreferred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many\nof which are beyond the control of HGV and Diamond. The estimates of the future performance of HGV and Diamond in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019\nanalyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or\nthose suggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to HGV\u2019s board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have\ntraded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis\ndescribed above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of HGV or\nDiamond.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between HGV and Diamond, rather than by any\nfinancial advisor, and was approved by HGV\u2019s board of directors. The\n \n68\nTable of Contents\ndecision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of HGV\u2019s board of directors. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were\nonly one of many factors considered by HGV\u2019s board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of\nthe views of HGV\u2019s board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the merger consideration.\nHGV has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of up to $35 million, of which (a) $1.5 million\nwas payable in connection with its opinion, and (b) $31.0 million base fee and up to $2.5 million discretionary fee are contingent upon the completion of\nthe merger. HGV also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify\nBofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against\nspecified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset\nand investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals.

In all affected forecast years, our\nmanagement\u2019s adjustments resulted in lower Adjusted Diamond Forecasts as compared to forecasts provided by Diamond.\nOur management, after discussions with Diamond, also estimated that the projected realization of (i) annual EBITDA synergies would be\n$25.1 million, $117.1 million, $135.7 million, $133.4 million and $119.8 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively, and (ii) discrete costs\n \n70Table of Contents\nwould be $25 million, $106.1 million, $104.5 million, $111.7 million and $10.5 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and\n2025, respectively, in each case assuming a July 1, 2021 closing date (which we refer to as the \u201cNet Synergies/Cost Savings\u201d). Such synergies are not\nreflected in the HGV Forecasts or the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts but they are reflected in the HGV Combined Company Forecasts (as defined below). In\naddition, our management prepared certain projections of future financial and operating performance for the combined company for the fiscal years\nending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 by combining the HGV Forecasts, the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts and the Net Synergies/Cost\nSavings. Such projections are referred to in this proxy statement as the \u201cHGV Combined Company Forecasts.\u201d The HGV Combined Company Forecasts\nwere provided to our board of directors and BofA Securities.\nThe HGV Forecasts, the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts, the Net Synergies/Cost Savings and the HGV Combined Company Forecasts are sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201cHGV Forward Looking Financial Information.\u201d\nWith our approval, BofA Securities utilized the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information for its financial analysis and for purposes of its opinion\n(summarized in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of Our Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement). The HGV Forward Looking\nFinancial Information (i.e., prospective financial information) was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with\nthe guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of\nour and Diamond\u2019s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments. In addition, the\nHGV Forward Looking Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-\nlooking statements or GAAP. Instead, such information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments,\nand presents, to each of our and Diamond\u2019s respective management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future\nfinancial performance of each of us, Diamond, and us and Diamond on a combined basis for the purposes of evaluating the merger. A summary of this\ninformation is presented below.\nThe HGV Forward Looking Financial Information covers multiple years and by their nature become less reliable with each successive year. While\nthe HGV Forward Looking Financial Information was prepared in good faith, no assurance can be made regarding future events. The estimates and\nassumptions underlying these financial forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and\nfinancial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant business, economic,\ncompetitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic\nconditions affecting the industries in which we and Diamond operate, and the risks and uncertainties described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d (as well as those\nthat are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement) and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d all of which are difficult to predict\nand many of which are outside our and Diamond\u2019s control and will be beyond the control of the combined company. We urge our stockholders to review\nour SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to our business, as well as the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d There can be no assurance that\nthe underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized, and actual results likely will differ, and may differ\nmaterially, from those reflected in the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information, whether or not the merger is completed. The inclusion in this proxy\nstatement of the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information below should not be regarded as an indication that we, Diamond, our respective boards of\ndirectors or our respective financial advisors considered, or now considers, these forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. The HGV\nForward Looking Financial Information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. In addition, both the HGV Forecasts and the Adjusted Diamond Forecasts assume that each of\nHGV and Diamond would continue to operate as standalone companies, without giving effect to the merger or other transactions discussed in this proxy\nstatement and as if the merger and other transactions had not been contemplated by us or Diamond.\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nThe HGV Forward Looking Financial Information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as\npresented in this proxy statement may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by us, Diamond or other companies. The footnotes to the tables\nbelow provide certain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (our\nindependent registered public accounting firm) nor any other independent registered public accounting firm (including Deloitte & Touche LLP, as\nDiamond\u2019s independent auditors) has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information\ncontained in these financial forecasts and, accordingly, none of Ernst & Young LLP, Deloitte & Touche LLP and any other independent registered public\naccounting firm has expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto and no independent registered public accounting\nfirm assumes any responsibility for the prospective financial information. Neither firm assumes any responsibility for, and each disclaims any association\nwith, such information. The Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte & Touche LLP reports incorporated by reference or included in this proxy statement relate to\nthe historical financial information of HGV and Diamond, respectively. Those reports do not extend to the financial forecasts and should not be read to do\nso. The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information forecasts were prepared by HGV solely for use by our board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of HGV\u2019s acquisition of Diamond, and BofA Securities in connection with their financial analysis and opinion and, Diamond and Diamond\u2019s\nfinancial advisor in connection with Diamond\u2019s consideration of the merger. Such forecasts are subjective in many respects.\nBy including in this proxy statement the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information below, none of HGV, Diamond or any of our or their respective\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of HGV or Diamond compared to the information\ncontained in the financial forecasts. Further, the inclusion of HGV Forward Looking Financial Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an\nadmission or representation by us that this information is material. The HGV Forward Looking Financial Information summarized in this section reflected\nthe best estimates, judgments and assumptions available to our management at the time such information was prepared and have not been updated to\nreflect any changes since the dates each was prepared. Neither us nor, after completion of the merger, the combined company undertakes any obligation,\nexcept as required by law, to update or otherwise revise the HGV Forward Looking Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing since their\npreparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error,\nor to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions.\nHGV Forward Looking Financial Information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding HGV contained in our filings with the SEC.\nThe summary of the financial forecasts is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the stock\nissuance proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting\u037e it is included because HGV Forward Looking Financial Information\nwas made available to our board of directors and our financial advisor and, in the case of the HGV Forecasts, to Diamond and Diamond\u2019s financial\nadvisor.\n \n72\nTable of Contents\nHGV Forecasts\nThe following table presents a summary of the HGV Forecasts prepared by our management.

These interests may create the appearance of conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was aware of these potential\nconflicts of interest during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in making its decisions to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the\nstock issuance.\nEach of the current members of our board of directors and our senior management team will continue as our director or executive officer,\nrespectively, following the completion of the merger and will hold office from and after the completion of the merger until his or her successor is duly\nelected and qualified or until his or her earlier\n \n74\nTable of Contents\ndeath, resignation, retirement or removal, except that, as previously announced, we and our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer have\nagreed to separate after the consummation of the merger as part of our planned integration of the Diamond business and synergy in connection with the\nmerger.\nThe merger will technically constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of our currently outstanding equity-based awards and current executive\nseverance agreements. However, as our obligations to make or confer any change in control payments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements\nunder such agreements and arrangements are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d (i.e., such benefits are triggered only as a result of a qualifying termination within a certain\nperiod of time after a \u201cchange in control\u201d event), and, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer as described above,\nwe do not intend to terminate any of our executive officers in connection with the merger, we do not anticipate any change in control payments,\naccelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to be triggered for our executive officers by the merger. The merger also will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d\nunder our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, pursuant to which certain of our executive officers have elected to defer salary and/or bonus amounts.\nPursuant to the terms of such plan, we are required to distribute to all plan participants all deferred amounts within thirty (30) days following the closing\nof the merger. However, all deferred compensation accounts are fully vested and only comprise those earned amounts that our executive officers have\nelected to defer. The merger does not result in any benefit enhancements under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.\nMerger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information\nabout certain compensation and benefits payable to each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.\nThe compensation shown in this table and described in the footnote to the table is the subject of a non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders\nat the special meeting, as described in \u201cProposal No. 2: Compensation Proposal\u201d beginning on page 152. The compensation reflected in the table below\nwould be triggered by the merger only if and upon the named executive officer\u2019s \u201cqualifying termination\u201d (as defined below) within certain periods of time\nafter the consummation of the merger as specified in such table. However, as noted previously, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and\nChief Marketing Officer, for whom we have already disclosed the pending separation, we do not intend to terminate any of our named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not expect to make any such payments to our named executive officers other than to our Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Marketing Officer in connection with her separation, and the information below is provided solely to comply with the applicable\ndisclosure requirements as noted above. In addition, with respect to the cash severance payments, our named executive officers would be entitled to\nsuch amounts in any event upon a qualifying termination in accordance with the terms of the severance agreements even without the consummation of\nthe merger. None of the information below represents any additional or enhanced benefits for our named executive officers other than those that already\nexist and have been previously disclosed.\nThe amounts reflected in the table relate to each named executive officer\u2019s existing severance agreement and equity awards, which arrangements\nwe have previously disclosed in our proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. The amounts indicated below are estimates based on\nmultiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below, and do not\nreflect certain compensation actions that may occur before the effective time of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed\n(i) August 1, 2021 as the closing date of the merger: (ii) a termination of each named executive officer\u2019s employment without cause or resignation for good\nreason, effective as of immediately following the effective time of the merger\u037e and (iii) a price per share of our common stock of $40.14 (the average closing\nmarket price of our common stock over the first 5 business days following the public announcement of the merger on March 10, 2021).\n \n75\nTable of Contents\nGolden Parachute Compensation\n \nNamed Executive Officer\n  \nCash ($)\n(1)\n   \nEquity ($)\n(2)\n   \nPension/NQ\nDC (3)\n   \nPerquisites/\nBenefits ($)(4)   \nTotal ($)\n \nMark.

The severance agreements provide that a\n\u201cqualifying termination\u201d means a termination of employment either by us without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason,\u201d each as defined in the applicable\nseverance agreement. An executive is not deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination as a result of (a) his or her death or disability or (b) solely as a result of a\nseverance agreement. An executive is not deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination as a result of (a) his or her death or disability or (b) solely as a result of a\nchange in control. Under the applicable severance agreement, in the event of a qualifying termination within 24 months of a change in control, each NEO would be\nentitled to receive a cash severance amount equal to 2.5 times (in the case of Mr. Wang) or 2.0 times (in the case of the other NEOs) the sum of the executive\u2019s annual\nbase salary at the rate in effect at the time of such termination and annual target cash incentive award under the short-term incentive plan for the year in which such\ntermination occurs. The NEO also would be entitled to a pro rata bonus for the year in which his or her qualifying termination occurred. For purposes of this table, we\nhave assumed that the NEOs received a pro rata target bonus for 2021.\n \n(2)\nReflects double-trigger equity acceleration benefits. The merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended. If the NEO\u2019s\nemployment is terminated by us \u2018\u2019without cause\u201d or by the NEO for \u201cgood reason\u201d within 12 months following a change in control, then (i) all unvested service-based\nRSUs will immediately vest\u037e (ii) all unvested stock options will immediately vest and become exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the options or 90 days after\nthe termination date\u037e and (iii) the performance-based RSUs will immediately vest at actual performance, or at target if performance cannot reasonably be assessed. For\nthe purposes of this table, we have assumed that the performance-based RSUs vested at target.\n \n(3)\nThe merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cEDCP\u201d), pursuant to which certain of our named executive\nofficers have elected to defer salary and/or bonus amounts. Pursuant to the terms of such plan, we are required to distribute to all plan participants all deferred amounts\nwithin thirty (30) days following the closing of the merger. However, all deferred compensation accounts are fully vested and only comprise those earned amounts that\nour executive officers have elected to defer. The merger does not result in any benefit enhancements under the EDCP.\n \n(4)\nReflects double-trigger benefits under the severance agreements. Under the applicable severance agreements for our NEOs, upon a \u201cqualifying termination,\u201d each NEO is\nentitled to continued healthcare coverage in an amount equal to the excess of the cost of the coverage over the amount that the executive would have had to pay if the\nexecutive remained employed for 18 months following the date of termination. In addition, to the extent we provide the executive\u2019s life insurance coverage immediately\nprior to the qualifying termination and this coverage is eligible for post-termination continuation or conversion to an individual policy, each NEO is entitled to receive a\ncash payment equal to the amount required to continue such coverage as an individual policy for a period of 12 months following the termination date (and, if we deem\nnecessary or advisable, to convert such coverage to an individual policy), payable in a single lump sum within 60 days following the termination date.\n \n(5)\nAs previously disclosed, Ms. Silver will separate from the Company after the consummation of the merger as part of our planned integration of the Diamond business and\nsynergy in connection with the merger.\n \n(6)\nMs. Hollkamp separated from the Company effective July 31, 2020.\nOur Board of Directors Following the Merger\nUpon the effective time of the merger, our board of directors will expand from its current size of seven members to nine members. All seven members\nof our board of directors prior to the merger will remain on our\n \n76\nTable of Contents\nboard of directors following the merger, and, pursuant to the stockholders agreement, two new members designated by the Apollo Investors will be\nappointed to our board of directors at the effective time of the merger. See \u201cOther Agreements\u2014Stockholders Agreement\u201d below, for more information\nabout the stockholders agreements and Apollo\u2019s right to appoint certain designees to our board of directors.\nRegulatory Clearances Required for the Merger\nWe and Diamond have agreed to use each of our reasonable best efforts to obtain all governmental and regulatory clearances and approvals\nrequired to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including our reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve such objections, if any,\nas may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) take all such actions as may be required\nto obtain all antitrust approvals as promptly as possible after the execution of the merger agreement and no later than the merger agreement Termination\nDate, including such action that would (A) require the divestiture of any businesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, of HGV, Diamond, or\nany of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, (B) limit HGV\u2019s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, Diamond and its\nsubsidiaries or affiliates or any of their businesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, or any of HGV\u2019s or its subsidiaries or affiliates\u2019 other\nbusinesses, properties, rights or assets, or portions thereof, or (C) limit HGV\u2019s ability to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to\nDiamond and its subsidiaries or affiliates, provided that (x) such action is conditioned on consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement and (y) such action would not require HGV to sell, divest, assign, dispose of or hold separate any businesses, properties, rights or assets of\nHGV, Diamond or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, or agree to, or enter into any conditions or mitigation agreements or other remedies with\nrespect to, any businesses, properties, rights or assets of HGV, Diamond or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, that (together with all other\nbusinesses, properties, rights and assets that are subject to antitrust remedies) generated more than $75,000,000 in revenues during the parties\u2019 respective\nmost recently completed fiscal years.\nUnited States Antitrust.

Upon issuance of such senior notes into escrow, the commitments in respect of the bridge facility were terminated.\nOn June 14, 2021, we priced an unregistered offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2031, which is\nexpected to close on June 28, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.\nTerm Loan Facility\nPursuant to the terms of the commitment letter, the proceeds of the loans under the term loan facility will be available upon the satisfaction of\nseveral limited conditions precedent on completion of the merger and will be used, together with the proceeds of the 2029 notes and the 2031 notes to\nfinance the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of HGV and Diamond and to pay fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the\nmerger. The loans under the term loan facility will mature on the seven-year anniversary after funding thereof.\nConditions Precedent\nThe commitment parties\u2019 obligation to fund the loans under the term loan facility is subject to several limited conditions, including completion of\nthe merger substantially concurrently with the funding of the term loan facility, the non-occurrence of a company material adverse effect (as such term is\ndefined in the merger agreement) on Diamond, the accuracy in all material respects of certain representations and warranties related to both HGV and\nDiamond, the delivery of certain financial statements of HGV and Diamond and other customary conditions more fully set forth in the commitment letter.\nInterest\nAt the option of HGV Borrower, borrowings under the term loan facility will bear interest at either a base rate or at an annual rate equal to the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), for deposits with a corresponding term in U.S. dollars adjusted for applicable statutory reserve requirements\n(such rate as so adjusted is referred to in this proxy statement as the \u201creserve adjusted Eurodollar rate\u201d), plus, in each case, an applicable margin and\nsubject to a 0.50% LIBOR floor. The applicable margin for the term facility will be 2.00% per annum with respect to base rate borrowings, and 3.00% per\nannum with respect to the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate borrowings.\nIf the base rate option is selected by HGV Borrower, interest will be at the base rate plus the applicable margin, calculated on the basis of the actual\nnumber of days elapsed in a year of 360 days (or 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, in the case base rate loans based upon the \u201cprime rate\u201d) and\npayable quarterly in arrears. The base rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the rate publicly announced by the\nadministrative agent as its \u201cprime rate\u201d, (ii) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (iii) the one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate\n(provided, that the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus 1.00% and (iv) 1.00%.\n \n \n79\nTable of Contents\nIf the reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate option is selected by HGV Borrower, interest will be determined based on interest periods to be selected by\nHGV Borrower of one, three or six months or (if agreed by all relevant lenders under the term loan facility) twelve months or, to the extent agreed to by the\nadministrative agent, a shorter period and for each interest period will be at an annual rate equal to LIBOR, for deposits with a term equivalent to such\ninterest period in U.S. dollars adjusted for applicable reserve requirements, plus the applicable margin. Interest will be paid at the end of each interest\nperiod (and at the end of every three months, in the case of interest periods longer than three months) and will be calculated on the basis of the actual\nnumber of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.\nCovenants and Events of Default\nThe commitment letter provides that the definitive financing agreement documenting the term loan facility, which is referred to in this proxy\nstatement as the \u201cterm loan credit agreement\u201d, will contain covenants substantially similar to the covenants in credit agreement, dated as of December 28,\n2016, among HGV Borrower, the guarantors party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended prior to the date of the\ncommitment letter, the \u201cexisting credit agreement\u201d), which, in each case, relate to, among other things, the following subjects:\n \n \n\u2022\n legal existence\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n payment of taxes\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n maintenance of insurance\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n performance of obligations\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n maintenance of property\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n observance of legal requirements\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n delivery of financial statements and other information\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n books and records\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on indebtedness\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on liens\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on dispositions of assets\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on affiliate transactions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on mergers, consolidations, amalgamations, liquidations and dissolutions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on restricted payments\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n limitations on investments\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n limitation on negative pledges.\nThe commitment letter also provides that the term loan credit agreement (if executed and delivered) will contain events of default substantially\nsimilar to the events of default in the existing credit facility, limited to nonpayment of principal, interest or fees (with grace periods for interest, fees and\nother amounts)\u037e failure to perform negative covenants (and affirmative covenants to provide notice of default or maintain HGV Borrower\u2019s corporate\nexistence)\u037e failure to perform other covenants subject to a 30-day cure period after notice by the agent\u037e any representation or warranty incorrect in any\nmaterial respect when made\u037e cross-default of, and cross-acceleration to, other indebtedness, subject to a threshold amount\u037e bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceedings\u037e final monetary judgments, subject to a threshold amount\u037e ERISA events, subject to material adverse effect\u037e invalidity (actual or asserted in\nwriting by HGV Borrower) of the applicable operative documents or material portion of collateral\u037e and change of control.\n \n80\nTable of Contents\n2029 Notes\nOn June 4, 2021, the Escrow Issuers issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of\n5.000% per annum and mature on June 1, 2029.

        "Section Header": "Stockholders Agreement",
        "Section Text": "Stockholders Agreement\nHGV, the Apollo Investors and, for certain limited purposes, Hilton, have agreed to a \u201cform of\u201d stockholders agreement, which the parties will enter\ninto as of the effective time of the merger. This stockholders agreement will govern the terms of the Apollo Investors\u2019 investment in HGV post-closing.\nThe following is a summary of the terms of the stockholders agreement.\nBoard and Governance Terms\nBoard Seats\nThe Apollo Investors will initially be entitled to designate two individuals (the \u201cApollo Designees\u201d) to serve on our board of directors (out of a\ntotal of nine directors). The Apollo Investors have indicated that the initial designees will be David Sambur and Alex van Hoek. The Apollo Investors\nalso have the right to designate replacements for the initial Apollo Designees, subject to undergoing a customary evaluation process by our nominating\nand corporate governance committee.\nIf we increase the size of our board of directors, for every three additional directors added, the Apollo Investors may appoint the third such\ndirector, so long as the Apollo Investors (or their affiliates who have executed a joinder agreement to become party to the stockholders agreement, which\nwe refer to in this section, collectively, as the \u201cApollo parties\u201d) still hold a number of shares equal to 20% of our total outstanding shares of common\nstock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing.\nThe right to designate members of our board of directors will step down as the Apollo parties\u2019 ownership decreases. When the Apollo parties no\nlonger own a number of the shares received at the closing of the merger equal to (i) 15% of our total outstanding shares of common stock immediately\nafter the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, one Apollo Designee will be required to resign and (ii) 10% of our total outstanding\nshares of common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, the second Apollo Designee will be required to\nresign and the Apollo Investors will no longer be entitled to any representation on our board of directors. The Apollo Investors cannot buy back into the\nright to designate any Apollo Designees to our board of directors. The shares are not fungible, so the Apollo parties must retain the relevant number of\nshares from those received in the merger at closing.\nBoard Committees\nOne Apollo Designee will be entitled to serve on the Audit Committee, subject to satisfaction of all eligibility requirements (including\n\u201cindependence\u201d requirements) for membership on the Audit Committee as mandated by applicable law, the rules of the NYSE and the charter of the Audit\nCommittee. Additionally, each of the Apollo Designees will have observation rights and will be entitled to notice of, and to attend, committee meetings\nexcept when such attendance would reasonably be expected to present an actual or likely conflict of interest for the Apollo Designees in the good faith\nopinion of the applicable committee. However, the Apollo Designees (except with respect to an Apollo Designee who is a member of the Audit\nCommittee) will not be entitled to a vote at such committee meetings.\n \n106Table of Contents\nTransfer Restrictions\nThe Apollo parties are subject to a 180 day lock-up period post-closing. Only certain \u201cPermitted Transfers\u201d (as such term is defined in the\nStockholders Agreement) are allowed during this period, including transfers to affiliates (subject to such affiliates executing a joinder agreement) and\ntransfers pursuant to a bona fide loan or other financing arrangement.\nAfter the lock-up period, the Apollo parties may freely transfer their shares, so long as such transfers (i) comply with the volume and manner of\nsale restrictions in Rule 144, (ii) (a) are to any person or group are of less than 5% of the total outstanding stock, and (b) are not to certain competitors of\nHGV or Hilton, known holders of 5% or more of HGV\u2019s common stock or known activists, or (iii) are pursuant to an underwritten offering or a broker-\nfacilitated block trade, in each case, so long as the Apollo parties direct the applicable underwriter(s) or broker(s) to comply with the restrictions set forth\nin clause (ii) of this sentence.\nHGV will have certain pre-emptive rights on transfers by the Apollo parties, and the Apollo parties will provide HGV with two days\u2019 prior written\nnotice in advance of consummating a proposed transfer (unless the notice is delivered before 9:00 am on a Friday, in which case the notice period only\nlasts until 4:00 pm on such day), and during the notice period will consider in good faith any written offer made by HGV to purchase all or any portion of\nthe HGV stock that the Apollo party proposes to transfer.\nStandstill Obligations\nThe Apollo parties will be subject to standstill obligations so long as (i) the Apollo parties own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total\noutstanding shares of our common stock at closing or (ii) the Apollo parties have the right to designate at least one director, including, subject to certain\nexceptions, prohibitions against:\n \n \n\u2022\n acquiring shares or debt of HGV\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n publicly offering to acquire HGV\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n soliciting proxies or influencing any voting of our common stock\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n seeking to control or influence of Board (including removal/election) or HGV management\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n initiating HGV stockholder proposals or seeking action by HGV stockholders\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n forming or joining a \u201cgroup\u201d with respect to the common stock of HGV (other than a group consisting solely of Apollo parties)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n seeking to control or influence HGV management or policies (alone or with others)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n advising, assisting, encouraging or entering into arrangements with anyone with respect to any of the above\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n arranging or providing any financing for the acquisition of common stock or assets of HGV by anyone generally (other than as permitted by\nthe stockholders agreement)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n publicly disclosing any intention, plan, or arrangement inconsistent with any of the above that an Apollo party knows, or would reasonably\nbe expected to know, would require HGV to make a public announcement regarding any of the foregoing activities\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n contesting the validity of the above restrictions or challenging any \u2018poison pill\u2019 or similar anti-takeover device.\nIf the Apollo parties no longer own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, the standstill provision\nwill terminate on the later of (i) the day after the next annual stockholders meeting and (ii) 90 days after the first date on which the Apollo parties\u2019\nownership falls below such 5% level.\n \n107\nTable of Contents\nThe Apollo parties will be permitted to acquire additional shares of HGV common stock, so long as such acquisitions do not exceed the lower of\n(i) the Apollo Investors\u2019 ownership level of HGV common stock at the closing of the merger and (ii) the Apollo Investors\u2019 ownership level of HGV\ncommon stock at the closing of the merger less the number of shares of HGV common stock transferred by the Apollo parties to a person other than\nanother Apollo Entity (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) plus 2% of the total outstanding shares of HGV common stock\nimmediately prior to such purchase.\nVoting Matters\nSo long as the Apollo parties own a number of shares equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock at closing, the Apollo\nparties are obligated to vote all of their shares as recommended by our board of directors with respect to routine matters (including contested or\nuncontested elections of directors, \u201csay on pay\u201d votes, approval of equity compensation plans and ratification of the selection of HGV\u2019s auditors).\nAdditionally, as described under \u201cStandstill Obligations\u201d above, the Apollo parties will agree to customary restrictions with respect to solicitation\nof proxies and voting of shares in contested elections. Otherwise, the Apollo parties will be free to vote their shares in their sole discretion up to the\nnumber of shares that represents the Apollo Investors\u2019 ownership percentage at the closing of the merger. If at any time the Apollo parties\u2019 ownership\npercentage exceeds what it was at the closing of the merger (due to share repurchases or another reduction in the total number of shares outstanding),\nthen any excess shares must be voted pro rata with other HGV stockholders.\nConsent Rights\nSo long as the Apollo parties hold a number of shares equal to at least 10% of our total outstanding shares of common stock immediately after the\nclosing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing, the consent of the Apollo parties will be required to (i) amend HGV\u2019s charter or bylaws in a\nmanner that would require stockholder approval and would materially, disproportionately and adversely affect the rights of the Apollo parties or\n(ii) increase the size of our board of directors to exceed twelve directors\u037e provided, that the Apollo parties have no such consent right for amendments to\nHGV\u2019s charter or bylaws to adopt poison pills approved by our board of directors.\nAdditionally, the stockholders agreement may not be amended without the written consent of both HGV and the Apollo Investors (and, in some\ncases, Hilton).\nRegistration Rights\nThe Apollo parties can make up to six demands to have HGV register the shares of our common stock received in connection with the\nconsummation of the merger, subject to standard carve-outs. Certain affiliates of Reverence Capital Partners (the \u201cReverence parties\u201d) and the other\nselling stockholders have the right to participate in any of the demand registrations, and the Reverence parties and Apollo parties have \u201cpiggyback\u201d\nrights allowing them to participate in registered public offerings by HGV.\nIf eligible to file a Form S-3, HGV must file the requested registration statement within 45 days of the written demand for registration. If not eligible,\nHGV must file a registration statement on another form as expeditiously as possible. HGV must keep the registration effective for at least 180 days after\nthe effective date (or such shorter period during which all registrable securities have been sold), subject to extension in the event of any required\nsuspension of sales.\nThe Apollo parties are responsible for paying all expenses for the registration of their shares.\n \n108\nTable of Contents\nPre-emptive Rights\nThe Apollo parties will have limited preemptive rights on certain future equity issuances, subject to customary carve-outs and limitations, so long\nas the Apollo parties own an aggregate of 10% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to\nthe stock issuance at closing. The Apollo parties will be able to participate in such issuances up to an amount equal to their then-current ownership\npercentage.\nConfidentiality and Non-Use\nThe Apollo Designees will sign a customary confidentiality and non-use agreement in substantially the same form as signed by other members of\nour board of directors.\nIn addition, Apollo Designees who serve, or have served in the preceding twelve months, on HGV\u2019s Board shall not serve on the board of directors\nof certain competitors of HGV or Hilton, or serve on the board of directors of any Apollo Entity (as defined in the stockholders agreement) that has a\nsignificant interest in such competitors. The Apollo parties are also prohibited from acquiring a significant interest in such competitors that would result\nin such competitor becoming an affiliate of any Apollo Entity.\nTermination\nGenerally, the stockholders agreement terminates when the Apollo parties no longer own a number of shares equal to 5% of our total outstanding\nshares of common stock immediately after the closing after giving effect to the stock issuance at closing\u037e provided, that certain provisions have earlier\ntermination dates as noted above.\nHilton Consent to Certain Amendments or Waivers\nHilton will be a party to the stockholders agreement solely for the purpose of requiring its consent prior to any amendments to or waivers of certain\nprovisions that govern (a) corporate governance matters, (b) voting matters, (c) transfer restrictions and (d) standstill obligations.",

        "Section Text": "MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF DIAMOND\nBusiness Overview\nDiamond and certain of its subsidiaries were established to complete the merger of DRI with certain Apollo affiliates, which was completed on\nSeptember 2, 2016 (the \u201cApollo Merger\u201d). DRI is a holding company, the principal asset of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in\nits subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described\nbelow. See \u201cNote 1:\u2014 Business, Background and Basis of Presentation\u201d to the audited consolidated and unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements of Diamond included in this proxy statement.\nDiamond is a global leader in the hospitality and vacation ownership industry, with a vast resort network of global vacation destinations located\naround the world, including the continental U.S., Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New\nZealand and Africa.\nDiamond\u2019s operations consist of two interrelated businesses:\n \n \n\u2022\n Vacation Interests sales and financing, which includes marketing and sales of VOIs and consumer financing for purchasers of our VOIs.\nDiamond derives a majority of its revenue and operating cash flows from the VOI sales and financing segment, primarily driven by sales and\nmarketing efforts at channels that predominately include managed resorts, on-site sales centers at affiliated resorts and local venues\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Hospitality and management services, which includes operations related to the management of the homeowners associations (the \u201cVOAs\u201d),\nmulti-resort trusts and the Diamond Collections, operations of the exchange programs, operation of certain resort amenities and the\nprovision of other hospitality and management services.\nSignificant Events\nHilton Grand Vacation Merger Agreement\nOn March 10, 2021, HGV, Merger Sub, Dakota Holdings, and certain stockholders of Dakota Holdings entered into the merger agreement. The\nmerger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein and in accordance with applicable law, Dakota Holdings\nwill merge with Merger Sub with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity after the merger.\nDiamond\u2019s board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\nincluding the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interest of Dakota Holdings and its stockholders, and authorized, approved and declared\nadvisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.\nThe Apollo Investors and the Dakota Holdings\u2019 other stockholders are expected to receive 34.7 million of HGV common shares, valued at\napproximately $1.6 billion (based on calculations as of June 1, 2021), subject to customary adjustments. Upon closing of the merger, existing HGV\nstockholders will own approximately 72% of the combined company and Apollo and the other Diamond stockholders will own approximately 28% of the\ncombined company on a fully diluted basis, subject to adjustments under the merger agreement. In connection with the merger, HGV intends to repay\nDiamond\u2019s Senior Facilities and First Lien Notes at the closing of the merger.\nAmong other things, the closing is subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV common shares in\nconnection with the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matter at a special\nmeeting of stockholders. See \u201cNote\n \n111Table of Contents\n25\u2014Subsequent Events\u201d to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this proxy statement for additional information\nrelated to terms and conditions of the merger agreement.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020 the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The results of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31. 2021 include impacts related to COVID-19 which have had a negative impact on Diamond and\nthe travel and hospitality industry. In response to social distancing directives and significant restrictions on travel caused by COVID-19, Diamond\ninitially closed most of its resorts and suspended its onsite sales and marketing operations. Diamond has taken several steps to enhance liquidity,\npreserve cash, reduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility, and the company\u2019s management is continuing to assess the evolving situation and\nwill take actions as appropriate. These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary reductions in salaries by\nits executive leadership team\u037e unpaid employee furloughs\u037e temporary elimination of 401(k) matching\u037e and deferral of all -non-essential operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nBeginning in May 2020, as governmental authorities began to lift restrictions, Diamond worked with health experts in establishing reopening safety\nprotocols. Diamond implemented and trained team members on the \u201cDiamond Standard of Clean.\u201d Since late May 2020, Diamond has re-opened the\nmajority of its North American Portfolio Properties and onsite sales centers, albeit at reduced capacity levels and revenue has not returned to pre-COVID-\n19 levels. Although certain of the Diamond Club offerings and member benefits, such as cruise itineraries, remain unavailable, Diamond expects total\nrevenue to recover to pre-COVID-19 levels late in 2021. Diamond continues to monitor travel restrictions and prioritize the safety of our customers and\nemployees. This involves a continuous assessment of whether the closure of resorts is necessary due to potential tightening of government restrictions,\nstay-at-home orders and the potential resurgence of coronavirus cases.\nDiamond considered the income tax accounting and disclosure implications of the relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act enacted on March 27, 2020. The effect of tax law changes is generally required to be recognized in the interim period in which the\nlegislation is enacted and reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2020, Diamond evaluated the income tax\nprovisions of the CARES Act and determined there to be an immaterial effect on the December 31, 2020 computation of the effective income tax rate for\nthe year. Diamond will continue to evaluate the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and monitor the developments in the jurisdictions where\nDiamond has significant operations for tax law changes that could have income tax accounting and disclosure implications. Diamond recorded $6.6 million\nof employee retention payroll tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act and similar foreign government programs in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBased on Diamond\u2019s current estimates regarding the magnitude and length of the disruptions to its business, it does not anticipate these\ndisruptions will impact its ability to meet its obligations when due or is ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants for at least the next 12 months.\nHowever, the ultimate magnitude and length of time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This uncertainty will require\nDiamond\u2019s management team to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions. Accordingly,\nDiamond\u2019s estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the company\u2019s results of operations, cash\nflows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.\nDebt Amendments\nDeutsche Bank Conduit Facility\nOn July 15, 2020, Diamond amended the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility to reduce the maximum commitment amount for aggregate borrowings from\n$250.0 million to $200.0 million and provide flexibility with respect to satisfying certain financial covenants through the first quarter of 2021 due to the\nongoing and uncertain future impact of COVID-19.\n \n112\nTable of Contents\nCapital One Conduit Facility\nOn August 4, 2020, Diamond entered into an amendment and waiver agreement related to its warehouse loan facility with Capital One, National\nAssociation (the \u201cWaiver\u201d).

Diamond paid $29.3 million to redeem the remaining aggregate principal amount of commitments outstanding.\nEarly Redemption of DROT 2016-1\nOn January 20, 2021, Diamond gave notice to exercise early redemption of the securitization notes outstanding under Diamond Resorts Owner\nTrust 2016-1 (\u201cDROT 2016-1\u201d) in the amount of $19.0 million, which includes aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest. The redemption was\ncompleted on February 22, 2021.\nMerger Signing Amendments\nOn March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments and a commitment letter relating to the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility for the\npurpose of amending the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Deutsche Bank Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be\nfurther amended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.\nOn March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments relating to the Capital One Conduit Facility for the purpose of amending the terms of\nthe operative legal documents relating to the Capital One Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be further amended in the future, to\naccommodate for changes relating to the Merger.\n \n113\nTable of Contents\nOn March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments and a commitment letter relating to the Credit Suisse Conduit Facility for the\npurpose of amending the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Credit Suisse Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be further\namended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.\nOn March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments and a commitment letter relating to the Credit Suisse Premium Yield Facility for the\npurpose of amending the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Credit Suisse Premium Yield Facility, as of the date thereof and as may be\nfurther amended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.\nOn March 10, 2021, Diamond entered into various amendments and a commitment letter relating to the Natixis Conduit Facility for the purpose of\namending the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Natixis Conduit Facility, as of the date thereof and as further amended on May 6,\n2021, as set forth below, and as may be further amended in the future, to accommodate for changes relating to the Merger.\nNatixis Conduit Facility\nOn May 6, 2021, Diamond amended the Natixis Conduit Facility to renew a line of credit provided by Natixis, New York Branch with a maximum\ncommitment amount of $125 million and to amend the terms of the operative legal documents relating to the Natixis Conduit Facility to accommodate\nchanges relating to the Merger.\nSubsequent Events\nIssuance of DROT 2021-1\nOn April 20, 2021, Diamond completed a securitization transaction involving the issuance of $319.2 million of securities (the DROT 2021-1 Notes\u201d).\nThe DROT 2021-1 Notes consists of four tranches of Vacation Interest notes receivable that include $134.1 million of Class A tranche notes, $83.2 million\nof Class B tranche notes, $65.4 million of Class C tranche notes and $36.5 million of Class D tranche notes. The interest rates for the Class A tranche\nnotes, the Class B tranche notes, the Class C tranche notes and the Class D tranche notes are 1.51%, 2.05%, 2.70% and 3.83% respectively. The overall\nweighted average interest rate of the DROT 2021-1 Notes is 2.16%.\nThe proceeds of the DROT 2021-1 Notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under certain Funding Facilities in the amount of $134.1 million\nin principal and accrued interest. The DROT 2021-1 Notes allow for a prefunding amount of $79.8 million which is available to draw subject to eligible\nVacation Interests notes receivable requirements as outlined in the DROT 2021-1 indenture. The remaining proceeds were used to fund reserve accounts\nand pay costs associated with the transaction with the remaining cash transferred to Diamond for general corporate purpose.\nSegment Reporting\nFor financial reporting purposes, Diamond presents its results of operations and financial condition in two reportable segments: Vacation Interests\nsales and financing and hospitality and management services, which include the operations as discussed above in \u201c\u2014Business Overview.\u201d Certain line\nitems reflected on its statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) fall completely into one of these reportable segments, while other line\nitems relate to both segments\u037e specifically, other revenue and loan portfolio expense, which are allocated to the appropriate segment based on the nature\nof the underlying transactions. Certain expense items, principally corporate interest expense, depreciation and amortization and provision for income\ntaxes, are not, in management\u2019s view, allocable to either of these reportable segments as they apply to all operations of the business. In addition, general\nand administrative expenses are not allocated to either of Diamond\u2019s reportable segments because historically management has not allocated these\nexpenses for purposes of evaluating our different operational divisions. Accordingly, these expenses are presented under corporate and other.\n \n114\nTable of Contents\nDiamond also provides financial information for our geographic segments based on the geographic locations of our subsidiaries in \u201cInformation\nRegarding Geographic Areas of Operation.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 ($ in millions).\n \n \n  \nThree Months Ended\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nMarch 31, 2021  \nMarch 31, 2020  \n$ Change  \n% Change \nRevenues:\n  \n \n \n \nVacation Interests sales, net of provision of $28.8 and $100.6, respectively\n  \n$\n98.9  \n$\n82.3  \n$\n16.6  \n \n20.2% \nManagement and member services revenue\n  \n \n100.3  \n \n108.6  \n \n(8.3)  \n \n(7.6)% \nConsumer financing interest\n  \n \n25.6  \n \n27.9  \n \n(2.3)  \n \n(8.2)% \nOther\n  \n \n16.7  \n \n21.1  \n \n(4.4)  \n \n(20.9)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal revenues\n  \n \n241.5  \n \n239.9  \n \n1.6  \n \n0.7% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCosts and Expenses:\n  \n \n \n \nVacation Interests cost of sales\n  \n \n19.6  \n \n19.1  \n \n0.5  \n \n2.6% \nAdvertising, sales and marketing\n  \n \n70.5  \n \n103.1  \n \n(32.6)  \n \n(31.6)% \nVacation Interests carrying cost, net\n  \n \n26.2  \n \n19.4  \n \n6.8  \n \n35.1% \nManagement and member services expense\n  \n \n45.1  \n \n55.9  \n \n(10.8)  \n \n(19.3)% \nLoan portfolio\n  \n \n6.9  \n \n8.7  \n \n(1.8)  \n \n(20.7)% \nGeneral and administrative\n  \n \n46.7  \n \n41.1  \n \n5.6  \n \n13.6% \nDepreciation and amortization\n  \n \n29.8  \n \n29.4  \n \n0.4  \n \n1.4% \nGoodwill impairment\n  \n \n\u2014    \n \n103.4  \n \n(103.4)  \n (100.0)% \nImpairments and other write-offs\n  \n \n\u2014    \n \n14.1  \n \n(14.1)  \n (100.0)% \nConsumer financing interest expense\n  \n \n8.6  \n \n9.2  \n \n(0.6)  \n \n(6.5)% \nGain on disposal of assets, net\n  \n \n\u2014    \n \n(0.6)  \n \n0.6  \n (100.0)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal operating costs and expenses\n  \n \n253.4  \n \n402.8  \n \n(149.4)  \n \n(37.1)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest income\n  \n \n(0.2)  \n \n(0.9)  \n \n0.7  \n \n(77.8)% \nCorporate indebtedness interest expense\n  \n \n40.3  \n \n51.1  \n \n(10.8)  \n \n(21.1)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoss before benefit for income taxes\n  \n \n(52.0)  \n \n(213.1)  \n \n161.1  \n \n(75.6)% \nBenefit for income taxes\n  \n \n(7.0)  \n \n(27.0)  \n \n20.0  \n \n(74.1)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet loss\n  \n$\n(45.0)  \n$\n(186.1)  \n$\n141.1  \n \n(75.8)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsolidated Results\nTotal revenues increased $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily from\na combination of the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n $10.3 million of higher revenues in the Vacation Interests sales and financing segment resulting from a $16.6 million increase in Vacation\nInterests sales, net, due to a decrease in the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $71.8 million, which was primarily due to\nan incremental loan loss included in the provision, related to COVID-19 of $0.0 million and $45 million for the three months ended March 31,\n2021 and 2020. The remaining decrease was due to lower gross Vacation Interests sales\u037e which was partially offset by a decrease in\nconsumer financing interest revenue of $2.3 million primarily due to a reduction in the balance of the notes receivable portfolio from the prior\nperiod and a decrease in other revenue of a $4.4 million due to reduction in closing costs revenue from gross Vacation Interests sales and\nlower business levels due to COVID-19.\n \n115\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\n $8.7 million of lower revenues in the hospitality and management services segment primarily resulting from a decrease in management and\nmember services revenue of $8.3 million mainly as a result of a decrease in room, food and beverage, and ancillary revenue primarily driven\nby reduced resorts\u2019 capacity and ongoing travel restrictions related to COVID-19.\nTotal operating costs and expenses decreased $149.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2020 primarily from a combination of the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n $145.1 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the Vacation Interests sales and financing segment primarily attributable to a\ndecrease in advertising, sales and marketing expense of $32.6 million largely driven by the decrease in gross Vacation Interests sales\u037e and\ncost reduction efforts related to COVID-19\u037e a decrease in goodwill impairment charge related to the NA VISF reporting unit of $103.4 million\nand a decrease in incremental allowance for credit losses related to the Acquired Notes of $14.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by\nan increase in Vacation Interests carrying costs, net of $6.8 million, which was primarily driven by lower rental revenues of $13.3 million,\ndecrease in usage of sales incentives, and partially offset by a decrease in inventory carrying costs of $6.5 million.\n \n \n\u2022\n $10.9 million of lower operating costs and expenses in the hospitality and management services segment primarily as a result of a decrease\nin management and member services expense of $10.8 million mainly as a result of a reduction in resorts\u2019 capacity and ongoing travel\nrestrictions related to COVID-19.\n \n \n\u2022\n $6.6 million of higher unallocated corporate costs primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expense of $5.6 million\nprimarily driven by acquisition related expenses for the HGV Merger.\nOur effective income tax rate of 13.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of\ncertain foreign income and losses included in U.S. taxable income, the impact of valuation allowances applied to certain foreign losses and permanent\nbook-tax differences.\nSee the following discussion by business segment for additional details.\n \n116\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Segment Results\nFollowing is a discussion of the results of each of our two business segments and corporate and other for the periods presented below.\nVacation Interests Sales and Financing ($ in millions, except as otherwise noted)\n \n \n  \nThree Months Ended\n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \nMarch 31, 2021   \nMarch 31, 2020   \n$ Change   \n% Change \nRevenues:\n  \n  \n  \n  \nVacation Interests sales, net\n  \n$\n98.9   \n$\n82.3   \n$\n16.6   \n \n20.2% \nConsumer financing interest\n  \n \n25.6   \n \n27.9   \n \n(2.3)   \n \n(8.2)% \nOther revenue\n  \n \n14.7   \n \n18.7   \n \n(4.0)   \n \n(21.4)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal revenues\n  \n \n139.2   \n \n128.9   \n \n10.3   \n \n8.0% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExpenses:\n  \n  \n  \n  \nVacation Interests cost of sales\n  \n \n19.6   \n \n19.1   \n \n0.5   \n \n2.6% \nAdvertising, sales and marketing\n  \n \n70.5   \n \n103.1   \n \n(32.6)   \n \n(31.6)% \nVacation Interests carrying cost, net\n  \n \n26.2   \n \n19.4   \n \n6.8   \n \n35.1% \nLoan portfolio\n  \n \n6.1   \n \n7.8   \n \n(1.7)   \n \n(21.8)% \nGoodwill impairment\n  \n \n\u2014     \n \n103.4   \n \n(103.4)   \n \n100.0% \nOther impairments and write-offs\n  \n \n\u2014     \n \n14.1   \n \n(14.1)   \n \n100.0% \nConsumer financing interest expense\n  \n \n8.6   \n \n9.2   \n \n(0.6)   \n \n(6.5)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal expenses\n  \n$\n131.0   \n$\n276.1   \n$\n(145.1)   \n \n(52.6)% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber of Tours\n  \n \n29,273   \n \n47,159   \n (17,886)   \n \n(37.9)% \nNumber of Tours\n  \n \n29,273   \n \n47,159   \n (17,886)   \n \n(37.9)% \nVPG ($ not in millions)\n  \n$\n4,687   \n$\n3,740   \n$\n947   \n \n25.3% \nGross Vacation Interests sales decreased by $55.2 million, or 30.2%, primarily due to a decrease in tours of 17,886 resulting from lower arrivals due to\nCOVID-19 partially offset by higher VPG of $947 driven primarily by an increase in average transaction price.

Vacation\nInterests sales, net primarily attributable to a decrease in tours due to COVID-19, partially offset by an decrease in the provision for\nuncollectible Vacation Interests sales of $8.2 million primarily due to lower gross Vacation Interests sales which is partially offset by\n$45.0 million incremental provision attributable to higher expected defaults resulting from economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19\npandemic\u037e and a $33.0 million decrease in other revenue largely due to decrease in insurance settlements received in as a result of Hurricane\nIrma as well as

related to the\nAcquired Notes\u037e and a $64.7 million increase in Vacation Interests carrying costs, net driven mainly by lower rental revenues and usage of\nsales incentives and lower costs associated with these items.\n \n \n\u2022\n $40.5 million of lower operating costs and expenses in Diamond\u2019s hospitality and management services segment primarily as a result of a\ndecrease in

attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $24.8 million\ndriven largely by a $12.5 million decrease in legal and professional costs related to corporate development activities as well as a reduction in\npayroll and related costs due to employee furloughs and cost saving measures as a result of COVID-19.\nCorporate indebtedness interest expense increased $4.3

These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary\nreductions in salaries by Diamond\u2019s executive leadership team\u037e unpaid employee furloughs\u037e temporary elimination of 401(k) matching\u037e and deferral of\nall non-essential operating expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, which is primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of undeveloped land which closed in January 2020.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2019. The increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds on securitization notes and Funding Facilities.\nComparison of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018 which is primarily due to $16.6 million of proceeds received under our business interruption insurance policies for resort closures as a\nresult of Hurricane Irma in 2019 and cash used to defend and settle dissenting stockholder lawsuits raised subsequent to the Apollo Merger in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $222.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018, primarily as a result of cash paid to acquire the Modern in April 2018.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the issuance of a principal amount of $200.0 million incremental term loans under the 2016\nSenior Credit Facility for the acquisition of the Modern hotel in April 2018, partially by an offset by increase in net payments on securitization notes and\nFunding Facilities in 2019.\nVOI Inventory\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, Diamond used cash totaling $15.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively, for acquisitions\nof VOI inventory, including administrative costs of recovery. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, these amounts include $14.3 million\nand $14.9 million, respectively, for the settlement of related party payables for acquisitions of VOI inventory pursuant to Diamond\u2019s assignment and\nrecovery agreements (\u201cIRAAs\u201d). These related party payables have been settled against related party receivables balances where we have a legal right of\noffset.\n \n128\nTable of Contents\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Diamond used cash totaling $32.6 million, $62.1 million and $72.6 million, respectively, for\nacquisitions of VOI inventory, including administrative costs of recovery. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, these amounts include\n$27.3 million, $42.2 million and $52.3 million, respectively, for the settlement of related party payables for acquisitions of VOI inventory pursuant to our\nIRAAs. These related party payables have been settled against related party receivables balances where Diamond has a legal right of offset.\nThe acquisition (including recovery) and development of VOI inventory are key factors in maintaining inventory for future sales. The amounts of\ninventory that may be purchased or developed in future periods may vary due to a wide variety of factors, some of which are not within Diamond\u2019s\ncontrol\u037e however, Diamond expects that significant future funds will be committed towards the purchase or development of VOI inventory. Such amounts\nmay or may not be consistent with cash used for these purposes in prior periods. Diamond believes that its VOI inventory on-hand as of March 31, 2021\nis sufficient to support sales over the next year giving Diamond flexibility in when it would acquire additional VOI inventory to support sales beyond that\ntime frame.\nLiquidity and Future Capital Requirements\nThe ability to monetize eligible Vacation Interest notes receivable has been critical to Diamond\u2019s continued liquidity. Access to public asset-backed\nsecurity funding has slowed as COVID-19 negatively impacted the capital markets. The impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets may have an impact\non the availability of this type of funding in the near term and the near future.\nAs of March 31, 2021, Diamond had $541.5 million of availability under the Funding Facilities, subject to $187.1 million of eligible notes receivable,\nand $92.0 million of availability under its Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn April 2021, Diamond completed a securitization transaction involving the issuance of $319.2 million of securities (the \u201cDROT 2021-1 Notes\u201d). The\nDROT 2021-1 Notes proceeds were used to fund reserve accounts, pay costs associated with the transaction, and repaid amounts outstanding of\n$134.1 million in principal and accrued interest under the Funding Facilities, with the remaining cash of $93.3 million transferred to Diamond for general\ncorporate purposes.\nDiamond believes that its current net cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and its existing non-recourse securitizations and\nFunding Facilities provide it with sufficient liquidity to meet its ongoing cash needs for the near future. Based on Diamond\u2019s current estimates regarding\nthe magnitude and length of the disruptions to its business, it does not anticipate these disruptions will impact its ability to meet its obligations when due\nor its ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants for at least the next 12 months.\nThe ultimate magnitude and length time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This uncertainty will require\nDiamond\u2019s management team to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions. Accordingly,\nDiamond\u2019s estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the company\u2019s results of operations, cash\nflows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.\nIndebtedness\nAs of March 31, 2021, Diamond had $2.0 billion of recourse indebtedness (excluding debt issuance costs), which included $862.8 million of term\nloans under the Senior Facilities, $500.0 million of the First Lien Notes, and $591.0 million of the Senior Notes. Diamond also had $569.5 million of non-\nrecourse indebtedness of our special-purpose subsidiaries (excluding debt issuance costs) in connection with its securitization program and Funding\nFacilities.\nDiamond\u2019s indebtedness could limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, strategic\ninitiatives or other purposes. In addition, the Senior Facilities and the\n \n129\nTable of Contents\nindentures governing the Existing Diamond Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit its ability to engage in activities that may be in its long-term\nbest interest.\nSecuritization notes and Funding Facilities, net. Diamond monetizes a substantial portion of the Vacation Interests notes receivable it generates\nthrough asset-backed bank Funding Facilities and periodically accesses the capital markets by issuing asset-backed securities through its securitization\nprogram. Diamond generally expects to securitize its Vacation Interests notes receivable at least once a year. The asset-backed facilities are non-recourse.\nDiamond has depended on the availability of credit to finance the consumer loans that it provides to its customers for the purchase of their VOIs.\nAccordingly, the availability of financing for the sale or pledge of these receivables to generate liquidity is a critical factor in its ability to meet its short-\nterm and long-term cash needs. Diamond has historically relied upon its ability to monetize receivables in the securitization market in order to generate\nliquidity and create capacity in its Funding Facilities. Any disruption to the asset-backed securities market or Diamond\u2019s ability to access such markets\ncould adversely impact Diamond\u2019s ability to obtain such financings.\nAs noted previously, Diamond had $541.5 million available under the Funding Facilities as of March 31, 2021, which has reduced its reliance on the\nsecuritizations market.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Funding Facilities had commitment amounts ranging from $125.0 million to $200.0 million. The advance rate for the\nVacation Interests notes receivable varies based on the characteristics of the eligible notes receivable with an overall limit range of 80% to 86%.\nBorrowings under the Funding Facilities bear variable interest rates of 1.75% to 3.00% plus LIBOR and are subject to non-use fees. The facilities generally\nhave a four-year maturity with a two- to three-year advance period and one- to two-year amortization period. Additionally, the facilities contain customary\nperformance triggers and financial covenants. The inability to meet these triggers and financial covenants could impact the monthly residual cash\nDiamond receives, limit its ability to draw on one or more of the Funding Facilities and potentially limit its ability to secure additional borrowings under\nthe Funding Facilities. Diamond was in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2021.\nIn general, the cost of financing related to Diamond\u2019s securitization notes and Funding Facilities fluctuates consistent with macroeconomic\nconditions and is not directly impacted by the delinquency or default rates of its VOI consumer loans. Delinquency and default rates generally are\nrelevant factors to be considered when negotiating the credit enhancement terms of Diamond\u2019s securitization notes and Funding Facilities, such as\nadvance rates. Diamond\u2019s weighted average effective interest rate on its securitization notes and Funding Facilities was 3.4% as of both March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively.\nDiamond\u2019s ability to secure short-term and long-term financing in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including its future profitability, the\nperformance of its consumer loan receivable portfolio, its relative levels of debt and equity, the credit ratings of its corporate indebtedness and\nsecuritization notes and Funding Facilities, net and the overall condition of the credit and securitization markets. There can be no assurances that any\nsuch financing will be available to Diamond. If Diamond is unable to secure short-term and long-term financing in the future or if cash flows from\noperations are less than expected, Diamond\u2019s liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected, it may be required to curtail our sales\nand marketing operations, and it may not be able to implement its growth strategy.\nDiamond monitors the capital markets and its capital structure and makes changes from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility,\npreserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. From time to time Diamond may elect to continue to repurchase additional amounts of\nits outstanding debt, including repurchases of Senior Notes or First Lien Notes, for cash through open market repurchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions with certain of its debt holders, although there is no assurance it will do so.\n \n130\nTable of Contents\nSee \u201cNote 16\u2014 Borrowings\u201d, \u201cNote 12\u2014Borrowings\u201d and \u201cNote 19\u2014Subsequent Events,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this proxy statement for additional details related to Diamond\u2019s borrowings, including details related to its securitization notes and Funding\nFacilities.\nDeferred Taxes\nAs of the tax period ended December 31, 2020, Diamond had $500.5 million of unused federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carry-forwards,\n$300.8 million of unused state NOLs and $150.0 million of foreign NOLs with expiration dates from 2020 through 2038 (except for certain foreign NOLs that\ndo not expire) that may be applied against future taxable income, subject to certain limitations. As of March 31, 2021, there have been no material changes\nto Diamond\u2019s deferred taxes from December 31, 2020.\nDiamond expects the rate at which it pays cash taxes to be less than the statutory tax rate for the foreseeable future.

To prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Diamond must make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements. Diamond regularly evaluates these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas it\nconsiders to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on its results of operations,\nfinancial position or cash flows. By their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from\nour estimates. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements included with this\nproxy statement for further detail on these critical accounting policies as well as the discussion that follows.\nVacation Interests Sales, Net\u2014Diamond sells VOIs through its sales centers which are primarily located in North America. Typical contracts\ninclude the sale of points-based VOIs, certain sales incentives in the form of additional points for use over a specified period of time, and membership in\nits points-based vacation programs, each of which represents separate and distinct performance obligations for which consideration is allocated based\non the estimated stand-alone selling price of sales incentives and membership dues. Diamond estimates stand-alone selling price based on historical\ninformation and allocate the remainder of the transaction price to the sale of points-based VOIs due to the variability in observable historical prices for\ntraditional VOI sales.\nDiamond generally offers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price of its VOI contracts with a typical term of 10 years, for which the financed\namount represents variable consideration. Variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value method to the extent that it is probable a\nsignificant reversal is not expected to occur. Diamond estimates the expected value to be collected based on historical default rates and recognizes\nrevenue net of amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Variable consideration that has not been included in the transaction price is presented as an\nallowance on Vacation Interests notes receivable. Diamond analyzes its allowance for loan and contract losses quarterly and make adjustments based on\ncurrent trends in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, the customer\u2019s credit score and other criteria, if necessary. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Vacation Interests\nNotes Receivable and Allowance\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited financial statements included with this proxy statement for further detail.\nDiamond recognizes revenue related to its points-based VOIs when control of the points passes to the customer, which generally occurs after the\nexpiration of the applicable statutory rescission period. For payment plans that restrict the use of points-based VOI products until a number of payments\nhave been made, Diamond recognizes revenue after the use restrictions have been lifted, which typically occurs after 90 days of the sale. Revenue related\nto sales incentives, which typically provides the customer with the right to reserve additional vacation stays over the average 18 month term of the\nincentive, is recognized based on usage. Diamond estimates breakage on incentives based on historical data and recognize estimated breakage\nproportionately to when other customers use their incentives. Revenue related to membership dues for the Clubs are included in the hospitality and\nmanagement services segment as described below. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated\nfinancial statements with this proxy statement for additional information.\n \n132\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Vacation Interests Notes Receivable\u2014Diamond uses significant estimates to record a provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests\nnotes receivable. This provision is calculated as projected gross losses for originated Vacation Interests notes receivable, not taking into account\nestimated VOI recoveries. Diamond applies historical default percentages to the Vacation Interests notes receivable population and evaluates other\nfactors such as economic conditions, industry trends, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance. Any changes\nto the assumptions used in calculating the allowance could result in a significantly different estimate of uncollectible Vacation Interests notes receivable.\nIf actual Vacation Interests notes receivable losses differ materially from these estimates, Diamond\u2019s future results of operations may be adversely\nimpacted.\nVacation Interests Cost of Sales\u2014Diamond applies the relative sales value method for recording cost of sales. Under the relative sales value\nmethod, cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage ratio of total estimated development cost to total\nestimated VOI revenue, including estimated future revenue and incorporating factors such as changes in prices and the recovery of VOIs generally as a\nresult of contract receivable defaults. The effect of such changes in estimates under the relative sales value method is accounted for on a retrospective\nbasis through corresponding current-period adjustments to inventory and cost of sales. Accordingly, small changes in any of the numerous estimates in\nthe model can have a significant financial statement impact due to the retroactive nature of any required adjustments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\u2014Diamond\u2019s most significant long-lived assets are goodwill and other intangible assets.\nDiamond does not amortize goodwill, but rather evaluates goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if\nevents or circumstances indicate that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying amount.\nDiamond reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nan asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less\nthan its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.\nThere are several estimates inherent in evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are,\nby their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of capitalization rates and the\ndiscount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Diamond had goodwill of $881.6 million and definite-lived intangible assets of $1,013.1 million.\nIf future results of operations and cash flows are not at sufficient levels, there is a possibility that Diamond may have to record impairments of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets in the future, which could be material to its consolidated financial statements. See also \u201cNote 12\u2014Goodwill\u201d and\n\u201cNote 13\u2014Other Intangible Assets, net\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements included with this proxy statement.\nIncome Taxes\u2014Diamond reduces the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is\n\u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed\nperiodically based on a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity\nof current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carry\nforward periods, Diamond\u2019s experience with operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. The above\nfactors can be highly subjective, and as such, actual results may differ from its estimates.\n \n133\nTable of Contents\nDiamond assesses uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. Diamond considers\nmany factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately\nanticipate actual outcomes. See \u201cNote 18\u2014Income Taxes\u201d to Diamond\u2019s consolidated financial statements included with this proxy statement for\nadditional information related to income tax related matters.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \u201cNote 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u2014Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included with this proxy statement for a discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements that impact us.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInflation. Inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on Diamond\u2019s revenues and net income (loss) during any of its three most\nrecent fiscal years\u037e however, to the extent inflationary trends affect short-term interest rates, a portion of its debt service costs, as well as the rates\nDiamond charges on its consumer loans, may be affected.\nInterest Rate Risk. Diamond is exposed to interest rate risk through its variable rate indebtedness, including the Funding Facilities and the Senior\nFacilities. The U.S. Federal Reserve has recently increased interest rates and has indicated there may be future interest rate increases. In addition,\nDiamond\u2019s variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate and may be hedged with LIBOR-based\ninterest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent international and regulatory guidance and may be phased out as an interest rate benchmark as of\nthe year ending 2021, although there is no definitive information regarding the future use of LIBOR or any particular replacement rate. Any such change\nmay have an adverse effect on the cost of Diamond\u2019s variable rate indebtedness or interest rate derivatives.\nDiamond has attempted to manage its interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. Diamond does not hold or issue\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes and does not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. To manage\nexposure to counterparty credit risk in interest rate swap and cap agreements, at times Diamond enters into agreements with highly-rated institutions that\ncan be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. See \u201cNote 20\u2014 Fair Value Measurements\u201d to Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included with this proxy statement.\nTo the extent Diamond assumes additional variable rate indebtedness in the future, any increase in interest rates beyond amounts covered under\nany corresponding derivative financial instruments, particularly if sustained, could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and\nfinancial position. Diamond cannot assure that any hedging transactions it enters into will adequately mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate\nincreases or that counterparties in those transactions will honor their obligations.\nAdditionally, Diamond derives net interest margin from its consumer financing activities to the extent the interest rates it charges its customers who\nfinance their purchases of VOIs exceed the variable interest rates it pays to its lenders. Net interest margin is calculated as the difference between\nconsumer financing interest revenue and consumer financing interest expense. Because Diamond\u2019s Vacation Interests notes receivable generally bear\ninterest at fixed rates, future increases in interest rates may result in a decline in Diamond\u2019s net interest margin.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 40.0% of Diamond\u2019s borrowings, or $1,020.3 million, bore interest at variable rates. However, all of Diamond\u2019s variable-rate\nborrowings require a minimal interest rate floor when LIBOR is below certain levels. Assuming the level of variable-rate borrowings outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2020, and assuming a one percentage point increase in the 2020 average interest rate payable on these borrowings, Diamond estimates that\nits interest expense would have increased and pre-tax income would have decreased by $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n \n134\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Translation Risk. In addition to our operations throughout the U.S., Diamond conducts operations in international markets from\nwhich it receives, at least in part, revenues in foreign currencies. Because Diamond\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value\nof the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Mexican Peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar have had, and will continue to have, an effect, which may be\nsignificant, on its reported financial results.\nA decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which Diamond receives revenues, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Mexican\nPeso and Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar will tend to reduce its reported revenues and expenses, while an increase in the value of any such\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to increase its reported revenues and expenses\u037e however the impacts on Diamond\u2019s revenues and\nexpenses may not always be equivalent. Variations in exchange rates could affect the comparability of Diamond\u2019s financial results between financial\nperiods\u037e however, since sales of Vacation Interests transacted in U.S. dollars have historically accounted for more than 90% of Diamond\u2019s consolidated\nVacation Interests sales revenue, and management and member services revenue is similarly concentrated, Diamond does not expect the variations in\nexchange rates to have a material impact on its financial results.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants\nDiamond has had no changes in and disagreements with accountants on account and financial disclosure that would be required to be disclosed\nunder Item 304(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\n \n135\nTable of Contents\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF",

        "Section Text": "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF\nHGV AND DIAMOND\nOn March 10, 2021, HGV, Diamond and Diamond\u2019s stockholders entered into a merger agreement, under which HGV will combine with Diamond\nthrough a series of business combinations. Diamond will be an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of\noperations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of\nHGV and Diamond for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, combine the historical consolidated statements of\noperations of HGV and Diamond, giving effect to the merger and the related financing as if it had been completed on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of HGV and Diamond, giving effect\nto the merger as if it had been completed on March 31, 2021.\nThe historical consolidated financial statements of Diamond have been adjusted to reflect certain reclassifications in order to align financial\nstatement presentation.\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information, estimates and assumptions that HGV\u2019s management believes\nare reasonable as of the date hereof. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the\naccompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for informational purposes only, is not intended to represent\nor to be indicative of actual results of operations or financial position of HGV or Diamond had the merger been completed on the dates assumed, and\nshould not be taken as indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those\nreflected in the pro forma statement of operations for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to\nprepare the pro forma statements of operations and actual amounts.\nIn addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with:\n \n \n\u2022\n HGV\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which are included in\nthis proxy statement\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Diamond\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which are included in\nthis proxy statement.\nThe historical financial statements have been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to give\neffect to pro forma events that are applicable to business combination accounting as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (GAAP). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information contained herein does not include integration costs or\nbenefits from synergies that may result from the merger.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith GAAP, with HGV considered the acquirer of Diamond. Accordingly, consideration paid or exchanged by HGV to complete the merger with Diamond\nwill generally be allocated to assets and liabilities of Diamond based on their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the merger. The\nacquisition method of accounting is dependent upon certain valuation assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation\nof the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Diamond based on management\u2019s best estimates of fair value. The actual purchase price allocation may\nvary based on final analyses of the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and changes in the acquired balances from operations up to\nthrough the actual merger date. In addition, the value of the consideration paid or exchanged by HGV to complete the merger will be determined based on\nthe trading price of HGV common stock at the time of completion of the merger. These changes may result in material adjustments.\nSome amounts do not match the Diamond historical financial statements due to rounding (refer to Note 4).\n \n136Table of Contents\nUNAUDITED PRO

Contents\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n \n1.\nDescription of the Merger and Basis of Pro Forma Presentation\nOn March 10, 2021, HGV and Diamond entered into the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each existing share of Diamond\ncommon stock issued and outstanding will be cancelled and converted into and exchanged for the right to receive a number of shares of common stock of\nHGV (and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares) calculated in the manner set forth in the merger agreement.\nCertain reclassifications have been made in order to align historical presentation of Diamond to HGV. Refer to Note 4 for these reclassification\nadjustments.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and HGV is considered the\naccounting acquirer. The acquisition method of accounting, based on ASC 805, Business Combinations (\u201cASC 805\u201d), uses the fair value concepts\ndefined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d). Fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible the application of\nreasonable judgment could result in alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances. ASC 805 requires that assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed in a business combination be recognized at fair value as of the merger date, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. Refer to Note\n3.\nThe estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the date of acquisition are based on estimates and assumptions of HGV. HGV\nwill continue to finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will be recorded upon (and, if necessary, after) the closing of\nthe merger. The fair value allocation consists of preliminary estimates and analyses and is subject to change upon the finalization of the valuation\nanalyses, and that change may be material.\nFor the purposes of preparing the pro forma financial statements, HGV has conducted a preliminary review of Diamond\u2019s accounting policies to identify\nsignificant differences. Upon consummation of the merger, HGV will conduct an additional review of Diamond\u2019s accounting policies to determine if\ndifferences in accounting policies or financial statement classification exist that may require adjustments to or reclassification of Diamond\u2019s results of\noperations, assets or liabilities to conform to HGV\u2019s accounting policies and classifications. As a result of that review, differences may be identified that,\nwhen conformed, could have a material impact on the pro forma financial statements.\n \n2.\nConsideration Transferred\nThe following table presents the fair value of the consideration transferred for the merger (in millions, except per share amounts).\n \nHGV Shares Issued (1)\n  \n 34,746,298 \nStock Price per Share (2)\n  \n$\n46.83 \n \n \n \n \n \nStock Purchase Price (3)\n  \n$\n1,627 \n \n \n \n \n \nRepayment of Diamond Debt (4)\n  \n$\n1,963 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Consideration Transferred\n  \n$\n3,590 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1)\nHGV shares issued is based on a fixed Base Purchase Price quantity of shares, reduced by certain closing leakage and excluded liabilities as defined\nin the merger agreement.\n(2)\nStock price is the closing price of HGV stock on June 1, 2021.\n(3)\nIf the stock price were to increase or decrease by 10%, the stock purchase price would change by $163 million.\n(4)\nThis reflects the balance of Diamond\u2019s debt to be repaid as of March 31, 2021, as well as $9 million of accrued interest. Refer to Note 5 below for\nmore information about debt repayment.\n \n140\nTable of Contents\n3.\nPreliminary Fair Values of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nThe following table presents our preliminary estimates of fair values of the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed (in millions) as of\nMarch 31, 2021(1). Our preliminary estimates are based on the information that was available as of the date of this filing. As discussed in Note 1 herein,\nthe preliminary estimated allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes. These changes will primarily relate to the\nallocation of consideration transferred and the fair value assigned to all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and identified. The final\npurchase price and goodwill could differ significantly from the current estimate, which could materially impact the pro forma financial statements.\n \nAssets acquired\n  \nCash and cash equivalents\n  $\n197 \nRestricted cash\n   \n100 \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts\n   \n75 \nTimeshare financing receivables\n   \n660 \nInventory\n   \n702 \nProperty and equipment\n   \n322 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n   \n19 \nIntangible assets\n   1,875 \nOther assets\n   \n431 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets acquired\n  $ 4,381 \nLiabilities assumed\n  \nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other\n   \n455 \nDebt\n   \n26 \nNon-recourse debt\n   \n585 \nOperating lease liabilities\n   \n21 \nDeferred revenues\n   \n211 \nDeferred income tax liabilities\n   \n378 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal liabilities assumed\n  $ 1,676 \nNet assets acquired\n  $ 2,705 \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal consideration transferred\n  $ 3,590 \n \n \n \n \n \nGoodwill (2)\n  $\n885 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1)\nThe allocation of assets and liabilities was performed in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, utilizing the definition of fair value as\ndefined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement.\n(2)\nExcludes tax effects\u037e refer to Note 6(h).\nThe following shows a breakdown of the preliminary fair value of Intangible assets and the estimated remaining useful lives as of March 31, 2021:\n \n \n  \nEstimated Remaining\nUseful Life\n   \nFair Value\n(In millions) \nTrade name\n  \n \n1 year   \n$\n19 \nManagement contracts\n  \n \n17 to 20 years   \n \n1,284 \nClub member relationships\n  \n \n9 to 10 years   \n \n114 \nVacation ownership relationships\n  \n \n4 to 5 years   \n \n458 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntangible Assets\n  \n  \n$\n1,875 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach intangible asset was valued utilizing forms of the income approach, with the trade name being valued utilizing a relief-from-royalty method and the\nother intangible assets utilizing multi-period excess earnings methods.

\u201cback-stop\u201d commitments to amend its existing revolving credit facility to an $800 million capacity.\nHGV also issued $850 million senior unsecured notes on June 4, 2021 and recently priced $500 million senior unsecured notes in a second debt offering\n(together with the term facility, the amended revolving facility, and the June 4, 2021 note issuance, the \u201cfinancing\u201d). HGV terminated its committed bridge\nfacility with its lenders following the issuance of the $850 million senior unsecured notes. The financing is depicted in the pro forma statement of\noperations as outstanding for the entire period.\nHGV intends to repay Diamond\u2019s senior facilities and first lien notes at closing and use the proceeds from the second debt offering to repay Diamond\u2019s\nsenior notes. This repayment is included in consideration transferred in Note 2. HGV intends to assume $26 million in other Diamond indebtedness\u037e this\ndebt is recognized at its fair value as part of the liabilities assumed in Note 3, for which no preliminary fair value adjustment was required.\nIn addition, using the financing described above, HGV intends to pay down HGV\u2019s existing revolver, term loan, and senior notes.\n \n6.\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments\nPro Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments\n \n \na.\nReflect the consideration transferred to acquire Diamond\u037e refer to Note 2.\n \n \nb.\nRemove the historical equity balances of Diamond.\n \n \nc.\nReflect preliminary fair value adjustments to acquired assets and liabilities and recognize goodwill\u037e refer to Note 3 for preliminary fair\nvalues.\n \n \nd.\nReflect repayment of Diamond debt as follows:\n \n \n  \nMarch 31, 2021\n(In millions)\n \nRepayment of principal(1)(2)\n  \n$\n(1,964) \nRepayment of accrued interest(1)(3)\n  \n \n(9) \nDerecognition of unamortized debt issuance costs(2)\n  \n \n52 \n \n(1)\nOffset to Cash and cash equivalents.

        "Section Text": "PROPOSAL NUMBER 2: COMPENSATION PROPOSAL\nPursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, we are seeking a non-binding, advisory shareholder approval of the\ncompensation of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Merger-Related Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers\u2014Golden Parachute\nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 76. This proposal and related disclosure are required notwithstanding the fact that, as previously disclosed, other\nthan the previously announced separation involving our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to terminate any of our\nother named executive officers in connection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not expect to make any such payments to our named executive officers\nother than to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer in connection with our previously announced separation.\nTherefore, we are asking holders of our common stock to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to the HGV named executive officers, in connection with the merger,\nand the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant\nto Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014Merger-Related Compensation for Our\nNamed Executive Officers \u2014Golden Parachute Compensation\u201d are hereby APPROVED.\u201d\nThe vote on the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the votes on the stock issuance proposal and the adjournment\nproposal. Accordingly, if you are a holder of our common stock, you may vote to approve the stock issuance proposal and/or the adjournment proposal\nand vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. The approval of the compensation proposal by holders of our common stock is not a\ncondition to the completion of the merger. If the merger is completed and only if our named executive officers (other than our Executive Vice President and\nChief Marketing Officer) are terminated in a manner that entitles them to the merger-related compensation, such compensation will be payable in\naccordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if holders of our common stock fail to approve this advisory vote\nregarding merger-related compensation.\nOur board of directors unanimously recommends that our common stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation proposal. However, as noted\nabove, except with respect to our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, we do not intend to terminate any of our executive officers in\nconnection with the merger. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any change in control payments, accelerated vesting or benefit enhancements to be\ntriggered by the merger for our other named executive officers.\n \n152Table of Contents",

Dakota and its\nsubsidiaries were established to complete the acquisition of Diamond Resorts International, Inc. (\u201cDRII\u201d). DRII is a holding company, the principal asset\nof which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating\nsubsidiary that has historically conducted the business described below.\nPrior to the acquisition of DRII on September 2, 2016 (the \u201cApollo Merger\u201d), Dakota had no operations or activity other than acquisition related\ncosts. Subsequent to the Apollo Merger, Dakota became the holding company and derives all of its operating income and cash flows from DRII and its\nsubsidiaries. Other than (i) the acquisition of the equity securities of DRII and the payment of transaction costs at the closing of the Apollo Merger and\n(ii) the issuance of Dakota Holdings common shares to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company\u037e there has been no significant\nactivity related to DRII\u2019s parent entities in the consolidated financial statements. See \u201cSchedule I\u2014Condensed Financial Information of Parent\nCompany\u201d for the financial information of DRII\u2019s parent entities.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in the hospitality and vacation ownership industry, with a worldwide resort network of global\nvacation destinations located around the world, including the continental United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central\nAmerica, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. The Company\u2019s portfolio consists of 110 resort properties (the \u201cPortfolio\nProperties\u201d) that the Company manages, are included in one of the Diamond Collections or are Diamond branded resorts in which we own inventory, as\nwell as 229 affiliated resorts and hotels, which the Company does not manage and which do not carry the Company\u2019s brand, but are a part of the\nCompany\u2019s network and, through THE Club\u00ae and other Club offerings (the \u201cClubs\u201d), are available for its members to use as vacation destinations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations consist of two interrelated businesses: (i) vacation interests (\u201cVOIs\u201d or \u201cVacation Interests\u201d) sales and financing, which\nincludes marketing and sales of VOIs and consumer financing for purchasers of the Company\u2019s VOIs\u037e and (ii) hospitality and management services,\nwhich includes operations related to the management of the homeowners associations (the \u201cVOAs\u201d) for resort properties and single- and multi-resort\ntrusts (collectively, the \u201cDiamond Collections\u201d), operations of the Clubs, operation of certain resort amenities and the provision of other hospitality and\nmanagement services.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020 the World Health Organization designated recent coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a global pandemic. The results of operations for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2020 include impacts related to COVID-19 which have had a negative impact on the Company and the travel and\nhospitality industry. In response to social distancing directives and significant restrictions on travel caused by COVID-19, the Company initially closed\nmost of its resorts and suspended its onsite sales and marketing operations. The Company has taken several steps to enhance liquidity, preserve cash,\nreduce expenditures and provide financial flexibility, and the Company\u2019s management is continuing to assess the evolving situation and will take actions\nas appropriate. These include measures such as: reductions in both salaries and workforce, including voluntary reductions in salaries by our executive\nleadership team\u037e unpaid employee furloughs\u037e temporary elimination of 401(k) matching\u037e and deferral of all non-essential operating and capital\nexpenditures.\n \nF-7Table of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nBeginning in May 2020, the Company saw demand return for reservations, which suggests that demand to vacation continues to be strong despite\neconomic uncertainty driven by COVID-19. As governmental authorities began to lift restrictions, the Company worked with health experts in\nestablishing reopening safety protocols. The Company\u2019s management implemented and trained team members on the \u201cDiamond Standard of Clean.\u201d\nUndertaking a phased approach since late May 2020, the Company has re-opened the majority of its Portfolio Properties and onsite sales centers, albeit at\nreduced capacity levels and revenue has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. Certain Club offerings and member benefits, such as cruise itineraries,\nremain unavailable. The Company continues to monitor travel restrictions and prioritize the safety of its customers and employees. This involves a\ncontinuous assessment of whether the closure of resorts is necessary due to potential tightening of government restrictions and the potential resurgence\nof coronavirus cases.\nBased on the Company\u2019s current estimates regarding the magnitude and length of the disruptions to business, the Company does not anticipate\nthese disruptions will impact our ability to meet our obligations when due or our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants for at least the\nnext 12 months. However, the ultimate magnitude and length of time that the disruptions from COVID-19 will continue is highly uncertain. This\nuncertainty will require the Company to continually assess the situation, including the impact of changes to government-imposed restrictions.\nAccordingly, our estimates regarding the magnitude and length of time that these disruptions will continue to impact the Company\u2019s results of\noperations, cash flows and financial condition may change in the future and such changes could be material.\nNote 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\u2014The consolidated financial statements include the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the\nCompany has a controlling financial interest, including certain variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). When evaluating an entity for consolidation, the\nCompany determines if the entity in which it holds a variable interest is a VIE. Management considers both quantitative and qualitative factors, including\nitems such as the economics, design and control of the entity. If the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is consolidated.\nAll intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications have been\napplied consistently to the periods presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net (loss) income or total assets and liabilities.\nUse of Estimates\u2014The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles require the Company\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nVacation Interests Sales, net\u2014Vacation Interests sales consist of revenue from the sale of points, which can be utilized for vacations at any of the\nresorts in the Company\u2019s network for varying lengths of stay. The Company sells VOIs through its sales centers which are primarily located in North\nAmerica. Typical contracts include the sale of points-based VOIs, certain sales incentives in the form of additional points for use over a specified period\nof time, and membership in the Company\u2019s points-based vacation Clubs, each of which represents separate and distinct performance obligations for\nwhich consideration is allocated based on the estimated stand-alone selling price of sales incentives and membership dues. The Company estimates\nstand-alone\n \nF-8\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nselling price based on historical information, including expected breakage in contracts with multiple performance obligations, and allocates the remainder\nof the transaction price to the sale of points-based VOIs due to the variability in observable historical prices for traditional VOI sales.\nThe Company generally offers financing of up to 90% of the purchase price of its VOI contracts with a typical term of 10 years, for which the\nfinanced amount represents variable consideration. Variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value method to the extent that it is\nprobable a significant reversal is not expected to occur. The Company estimates the expected value to be collected based on historical default rates and\nrecognizes revenue net of amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Variable consideration that has not been included in the transaction price is presented as\nan allowance on Vacation Interests notes receivable. The Company analyzes its allowance for loan and contract losses quarterly and makes adjustments\nbased on current trends in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, the customer\u2019s credit score and other criteria, if necessary. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Vacation\nInterests Notes Receivable and Allowance\u201d for further detail.\nThe Company recognizes revenue related to its points-based VOIs when control of the points passes to the customer, which generally occurs after\nthe expiration of the applicable statutory rescission period. For payment plans that restrict the use of points-based VOI products until a number of\npayments have been made, the Company recognizes revenue after the use restrictions have been lifted, which typically occurs after 90 days of the sale.\nManagement and Member Services Revenue\u2014Management and member services revenue includes resort management fees charged to the VOAs\nand the members associations of the Diamond Collections (the \u201cCollection Associations\u201d), revenues from the Company\u2019s operation of the Clubs and\nrevenues from other ancillary services. These revenues are recorded and recognized as follows:\n \n \ni.\nThe Company\u2019s management contracts typically have initial terms of three to ten years, with automatic renewals. The Company earns\nmanagement fee revenue based upon the terms of the Company\u2019s management agreements with the VOAs and Collection Associations.\nManagement fees are determined on a cost-plus basis, for which costs are reimbursed based on an amount established annually by the\nrespective VOA\u2019s or Collections Associations. Management fees are billed monthly and the Company reduces management fees for\namounts it has paid to VOAs or Collections Associations for maintenance fees on Company-owned VOIs. The Company provides\nmanagement services to the VOAs and Collections Associations over the duration of the arrangement which includes a number of activities\nrelated to the operations and maintenance of the resorts and associations. These services are substantially consistent from day to day, and\ntherefore represent a series of distinct goods or services that are considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is\nrecognized ratably over time as services are performed.\n \n \n  \nCost reimbursements, such as payroll costs for Company employees who perform services under the management agreements, and the cost\nof property and liability insurance allocated by the Company to the VOAs and Collection Associations, are recorded on a gross basis in\nmanagement and member services revenue and management and member services expense. Reimbursed corporate costs allocated to the\nVOAs and Collections are presented on a gross basis as management and member services revenue with the related expenses recorded\nprimarily in management and member services expense and general and administrative expense. Management and member services revenue\nand expenses related to the Company\u2019s annual maintenance fee assessments (for VOIs owned by the Company) are presented net in\nVacation interests carrying cost, net.\n \n \nii.\nClub membership represents a series of distinct goods or services, or days of member services for which each day is distinct, and is\naccounted for as a single performance obligation. The stand-alone\n \nF-9\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \n \nselling price is directly observable as the stated amount for membership dues invoiced by the Company and is recognized ratably over time.\nMembership contracts typically have a term of one year with payment due at the beginning of the year. Fees related to other ancillary\nservices are recognized at the time when the member elects to purchase the additional services and the services have been provided.\n \n \niii.\nThe Company also earns revenue related to the provision of ancillary services at certain resorts, and these revenues are recognized when\ngoods have been provided or services have been rendered.\nInterest Revenue\u2014The Company\u2019s interest revenue consists primarily of interest earned on consumer loans, and is accrued based on the\ncontractual provisions of the loan documents, which is suspended at the earlier of (i) the customer\u2019s account becoming over 90 days delinquent, or\n(ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings. If payments are received while a consumer loan is considered delinquent, interest is\nrecognized on a cash basis. Interest accrual resumes once a customer has brought the account current.\nOther Revenue\u2014Other revenue includes items such as collection fees paid by VOAs and Collections Associations, closing costs paid by\npurchasers on sales of VOIs, promotional VOI products for which the performance obligation is satisfied when a customer makes a reservation at an\naffiliate resort, late/impound fees assessed on consumer loans, and loan servicing fees earned for servicing third party portfolios.\nVacation Interests Cost of Sales\u2014The Company applies the relative sales value method for relieving VOI inventory and recording the related cost\nof sales, under which cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage ratio of total estimated cost to total\nestimated VOI revenue, including estimated future revenue and incorporating factors such as changes in prices and the recovery of VOIs. The effect of\nsuch changes in estimates under the relative sales value method is accounted for on a retrospective basis through corresponding current-period\nadjustments to inventory and cost of sales. See also \u201cUnsold Vacation Interests\u201d below.\nAdvertising, Sales and Marketing Costs\u2014Advertising, sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred, except for deferred costs directly\nrelated to VOI sales that are not eligible for revenue recognition. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, advertising expense recognized\nwas $10.1 million, $12.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively.\nVacation Interests Carrying Cost, net\u2014Vacation Interests carrying cost, net includes the maintenance fees and assessments paid or payable to the\nVOAs and the Collection Associations for VOIs owned by the Company, certain amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Company\u2019s inventory recovery\nand assignment agreements with the VOAs and Diamond Collections for the recapture of VOIs (\u201cIRAAs\u201d).\nTo offset the Company\u2019s Vacation Interests carrying costs, the Company rents VOIs for which it has rights to use to third parties on a short-term\nbasis, and also generates revenue on sales incentives, including sales of sampler programs (\u201cSampler Packages\u201d), which allow prospective owners to\nstay at a resort property on a trial basis. Revenue and the associated expenses for incentives is recognized as a net reduction to Vacation Interests\ncarrying costs and is based on usage. The Company estimates breakage based on historical data and recognizes estimated breakage proportionately to\nwhen other customers use their incentives. Sales incentives and Sampler packages provide the customer with the right to reserve vacation stays typically\nover an average 18 month period. The Company has extended the term for points expiring in 2020 for up to 12 months due to travel restrictions caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nManagement and Member Services Expense\u2014Management and member services expense includes: (i) certain costs associated with the provision\nof services under the management agreements with the VOAs and\n \nF-10\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nCollection Associations\u037e (ii) the costs associated with the operation of the Clubs (including costs incurred for call centers, membership fees paid to a\nthird-party exchange company on behalf of members of the Clubs, as applicable, and administrative expenses)\u037e and (iii) the costs to provide other\nancillary services at certain resort locations.\nLoan Portfolio Expense\u2014Loan portfolio expense includes payroll and administrative costs of finance operations and credit card processing fees,\nas well as in-house collections performed on behalf of the VOAs. These costs are expensed as incurred.\nInterest Expense\u2014Interest expense related to the Company\u2019s securitizations and Funding Facilities is classified as consumer financing interest\nexpense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Interest expense related to corporate debt is classified as corporate\nindebtedness interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Borrowings\u201d for the definition of\nFunding Facilities.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\u2014The Company measures stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records the\nrelated expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See \u201cNote 21\u2014Stock-Based Compensation\u201d for further detail on\nthe Company\u2019s stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes\u2014The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which the\nCompany operates. The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\nbased on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are\nrequired to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that such assets will not be realized.\nAccordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d realization\nthreshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future\nprofitability, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, the Company\u2019s experience with\noperating loss and tax credit carry-forwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nThe Company records a deferred tax asset for its net operating losses, a portion of which the use thereof is subject to limitations. As a result of\nuncertainties regarding the Company\u2019s ability to utilize such net operating loss carry-forwards, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against the\ndeferred tax assets attributable to these net operating losses.\nThe Company assesses uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is\nto evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that the position will\nbe sustained on examination, based solely on the technical merits. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than\n50% likely of being sustained on examination. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the Company\u2019s tax positions and tax\nbenefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\u2014Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds, and all highly-liquid investments purchased with\nan original maturity date of three months or less.\nCash in Escrow and Restricted Cash\u2014Cash in escrow consists of deposits received on sales of VOIs that are held in escrow until the legal\nrescission period has expired. Restricted cash consists primarily of cash held for\n \nF-11\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nthe benefit of the note holders including the reserve and cash collections on certain Vacation Interests notes receivable that secure collateralized notes.\nRestricted cash also includes certain amounts collected on behalf of VOAs and deposits related to Vacation Interests notes receivable servicing\nagreements.\nVacation Interests Notes Receivable and Related Allowance\u2014Vacation Interests notes receivable are recorded net of (i) deferred costs\u037e (ii) any\ndiscount or premium\u037e and (iii) the related allowance for losses. Origination costs incurred in connection with providing financing for VOIs are capitalized\nand amortized over the average life of Vacation Interests notes receivable as an adjustment to consumer financing interest revenue using the effective\ninterest method.\nThe allowance for notes receivable losses is calculated using the Company\u2019s historical default percentages and other factors such as economic\nconditions, industry trends, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance. Any adjustments to the allowance for\nVacation Interests notes receivable are recorded within the provision for uncollectible Vacation Interests sales revenue.\nSee \u201cNote 6\u2014Vacation Interests Notes Receivable and Allowance\u201d for more information on how Vacation Interests notes receivable are presented\nafter giving effect to the Apollo Merger and the Company\u2019s policy for recording impairments.\nDue from Related Parties and Due to Related Parties\u2014Amounts due from related parties and due to related parties consist primarily of\ntransactions with VOAs or Collection Associations for which the Company acts as the management company. Due to related parties also includes\namounts accrued related to the management agreement with Apollo and Reverence relating to the provision of management consulting and advisory\nservices to the Company. See \u201cNote 7\u2014Transactions with Related Parties\u201d for further detail.\nOther Receivables, net\u2014Other receivables, net consists primarily of Sampler Package receivables and interest receivable. The Company evaluates,\namong other things, defaults and the age of past due amounts to analyze the adequacy of the allowance for other receivables. The allowance for other\nreceivables as of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nAny adjustments to the allowance are recorded within management and member services revenue or Vacation Interests carrying cost, net.\nUnsold Vacation Interests\u2014Unsold Vacation Interests are valued at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The cost of unsold VOIs\nincludes acquisition costs, undeveloped land, hard and soft construction costs (comprised of architectural and engineering costs incurred during\nconstruction), the cost incurred to recover inventory and other carrying costs (including interest, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the\nconstruction period). The costs capitalized for recovered VOIs differ based on a variety of factors, including the method of recovery and the timing of the\noriginal sale. Costs are expensed as VOIs are sold to Vacation Interests cost of sales under the relative sales value method, described above. The\nCompany also records Vacation Interests purchases in-transit, which are purchases of Vacation Interests from third parties for which title has not been\ntransferred to the Company. These Vacation Interests purchases in-transit are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and are reclassified to\nunsold Vacation Interests upon successful transfer of title.\nProperty and Equipment, net\u2014Property and equipment are recorded at either cost to acquire or construct or fair value in the case of assets\nacquired through a business combination. The costs of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized when incurred,\nand all associated repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n \nF-12\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nBuildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives, which range\nfrom one to 40 years, or the remainder of the lease terms. Furniture, office equipment, computer software and computer equipment are depreciated using\nthe straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.\nThe Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nan asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less\nthan its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset.\nGoodwill\u2014Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually\nidentified and separately recognized. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but rather evaluates goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis\nor at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the\ncarrying amount, including goodwill, which may include a qualitative assessment (a \u201cstep zero\u201d assessment). If the qualitative assessment determines\nthat it is not \u201cmore-likely- than-not\u201d that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is\ndetermined to exist for the reporting unit.\nIf the qualitative step zero assessment indicates that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue including goodwill, or the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative assessment, then goodwill is assessed for impairment. The Company\nperforms its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company recognizes\nan impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value.\nIntangible assets\u2014Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Other\nIntangible Assets, net\u201d for information on estimated useful lives.\nThe Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an\nasset is less than its net book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. In\nrelation to the intangible asset for management contracts, the Company has the intent and ability to renew the underlying management contracts and\nmost of such contracts auto-renew.\nForeign Currency Translation\u2014Assets and liabilities in foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the\nend of the reporting period. Income and expense accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange. The net gain or loss is shown\nas a translation adjustment and is included in other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\u2014Other comprehensive (loss) income includes all changes in equity from non-owner sources such as foreign\ncurrency translation adjustments.\nFair Value Measurements\u2014Fair value measurements affect the Company\u2019s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company\u2019s\naccounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\n \nF-13\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2019-12 on January 1, 2021, and is currently evaluating the\nstandard to determine the impact of adoption on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform\u201d (\u201cASU No. 2020-04\u201d), which provides optional expedients and\nexceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. These optional amendments were effective for all entities upon\nissuance and can be applied to certain contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The Company did not have any qualifying contract\nmodifications in the year ended December 31, 2020 and will continue to evaluate whether this guidance impacts future contract modifications as they\noccur.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASU No. 2016-02\u201d). This standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a\nlessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer that 12 months. Leases are classified as either\nfinance or operating. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No 2016-02, and all the related amendments, using the modified retrospective\nmethod.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d\n(\u201cASU No. 2016-13\u201d), which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held as of the reporting date based on historical\nexperience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 and all of the\nrelated amendments, which have been included in Accounting Standards Codifications as ASC 326\u2014Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (\u201cASC 326\u201d),\non a prospective basis. As the Company\u2019s historical approach for estimating allowance for loan losses aligns with the expected credit model required by\nASU No. 2016-13, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Vacation Interests\nNotes Receivable and Allowance\u201d for additional disclosures related to the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \u201cCustomer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing\nArrangement that is a Service Contract\u201d (\u201cASU No. 2018-15\u201d), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting\narrangement that is a service contract with requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The\nCompany adopted ASU No. 2018-15 on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\n \nF-14\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nNote 3\u2014Concentrations of Risk\nCredit Risk\u2014The Company offers financing to the buyers of VOIs and in most cases bears the risk of defaults on promissory notes delivered to it\nby these buyers. Generally, if a buyer defaults, the Company recovers the VOI to offer for resale, in which case the associated selling, marketing and\nadministrative costs from the original sale are not recovered, and such costs must be incurred again to resell the VOIs. Although in many cases the\nCompany may have recourse against a buyer of VOIs for the unpaid price, certain states have laws that limit the Company\u2019s ability to recover personal\njudgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans. The Company has generally not pursued this remedy.\nThe Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, cash in escrow and restricted cash with various financial institutions located throughout North\nAmerica, Europe and the Caribbean. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s cash is maintained with a select few banks and is, accordingly, subject to\ncredit risk. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of financial institutions maintaining the deposits are performed to evaluate and mitigate, if\nnecessary, any credit risk.\nAvailability of Funding Sources\u2014The Company has historically funded Vacation Interests notes receivable and unsold Vacation Interests with\nborrowings through its financing facilities and internally generated funds. Borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds received by the Company from\nrepayments of such Vacation Interests notes receivable. To the extent that the Company is not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings,\nit may have to curtail its sales and marketing operations or sell assets, thereby resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations, cash flows and financial condition.\nGeographic Concentration\u2014Portions of the Company\u2019s consumer loan portfolio have been concentrated in certain geographic regions within the\nU.S. The deterioration of the economic condition and financial well-being of the regions in which the Company has significant loan concentrations could\nadversely affect the results of operations for its consumer loan portfolio business. The credit risk inherent in such concentrations is dependent upon\nregional and general economic stability, which affects property values and the financial well-being of the borrowers. As of the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s loans to California residents constituted 26.0% and 27.0%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio. No other state or\nforeign country concentration accounted for more than 10.0% of the portfolio.\nInterest Rate Risk\u2014Since a certain portion of the Company\u2019s indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, any increase in interest rates,\nparticularly if sustained, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company may enter\ninto derivative financial instruments on a periodic basis to mitigate this risk. See \u201cNote 20\u2014Fair Value Measurements\u201d for additional information.\nThe Company derives net interest income from its financing activities because the interest rates it charges its customers who finance the purchase\nof their VOIs exceed the interest rates the Company pays to its lenders. Since the Company\u2019s Vacation Interests notes receivable generally bear interest at\nfixed rates, increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that the Company has historically obtained.\n \nF-15\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

Eligibility for this financing is principally\ndependent upon the customer\u2019s Fair Isaac Corporation (\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores and other factors, which are based on review of the customers\u2019 credit\nhistory. As of December 31, 2020, Vacation Interests notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates between 5.0% and 24.0%. The Vacation Interests notes\nreceivable originated by the Company generally have a term of 10 years and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The weighted average interest\nrate of outstanding Vacation Interests notes receivable was 15.2% and 15.0% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s accrued interest on Vacation Interest notes receivable is accrued based on the contractual provisions of the loan documents, which\nis suspended at the earlier of (i) the customer\u2019s account becoming over 90 days delinquent, or (ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure\nproceedings. If payments are received while a consumer loan is considered delinquent, interest is recognized on a cash basis. Interest accrual resumes\nonce a customer has brought the account current. Based the Company\u2019s policy to timely charge-off accrued interest, the Company does not require an\nallowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. Write-offs related to accrued interest receivables included in consumer financing interest\nrevenue were $11.6 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued interest receivables are presented in\nother receivables on the balance sheet and were $8.6 million and $10.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company charges off Vacation Interests notes receivable upon the earlier of: (i) the customer\u2019s account becoming over 120 days delinquent\u037e or\n(ii) the completion of cancellation or foreclosure proceedings.

Due to current market volatility and lack of reliable market data, the Company determined that the income\napproach provided a more reliable estimate of the fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized a full\nimpairment charge totaling $103.4 million in its Vacation Interests sales and financing reportable segment during the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in\ntax benefit of $2.5 million.\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of fair value of the NA VISF reporting unit was performed using Level 3 inputs utilizing estimated future cash flows\ndiscounted at rates commensurate with the capital and cost of capital of comparable market participants. The income approach requires several\nassumptions including those regarding future revenue growth, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins, and\ncapital expenditures, which are the basis for information used in the discounted cash flow model. The weighted-average cost of capital used in the income\napproach ranged from 12.5% to 13.0%, with a terminal revenue growth rate of 3.0%.\nThere were no impairments of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNote 13\u2014Other Intangible Assets, Net\nOther intangible assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n \n \n  \nAsset\nLives    \nGross\nCarrying\nCost\n   \nAccumulated\nAmortization   \nNet\nBook\nValue  \nManagement contracts\n  \n 14 to 27   \n$\n994.5   \n$\n(158.6)   \n$ 835.9\nMember relationships and the Clubs\n  \n \n5 to 8   \n \n234.5   \n \n(155.7)   \n \n78.8\nTrade names and other intangible assets\n  \n 6 to 20   \n \n148.9   \n \n(50.5)   \n \n98.4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal other intangible assets\n  \n  \n$ 1,377.9   \n$\n(364.8)   \n$1,013.1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-26\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nSenior Facilities\nOn September 2, 2016, DRII entered into an $800.0 million senior secured financing (the \u201cSenior Facilities\u201d) consisting of: (i) a $700.0 million term\nloan facility with a maturity of seven years (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d)\u037e and (ii) a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity of five years (the\n\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). DRII may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under the Revolving Credit\nFacility in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of (i) $275.0 million plus (ii) an additional amount if the Company attains certain leverage ratios, subject\nto certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders.\nOn April 16, 2018, the Company entered into an incremental assumption agreement with certain lenders of our Senior Facilities to borrow an\nadditional principal amount of $200.0 million of term loans (the \u201cIncremental Term Loans\u201d). The terms, conditions, and covenants applicable to the\nIncremental Term Loans are consistent with those of the existing term loans under the Senior Facilities. The net proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans\nwere used to finance the acquisition of the Modern and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith.\nOn June 15, 2018, the Company repriced the $889.5 million of term loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities (the \u201cRepricing\u201d). The Repricing\neffectively replaced DRII\u2019s existing senior secured term loans (the \u201cExisting Term Loans\u201d) with senior secured term loans which bear interest equal to, at\nthe option of DRII, either (a) a London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the\ninterest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the\nhighest of: (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum\u037e (ii) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or another similar rate as determined by\nthe administrative agent)\u037e or (iii) the one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1% per annum, in each case plus an applicable margin of 3.75% for LIBOR loans and\n2.75% for base rate loans (the \u201cRepricing Term Loans\u201d). The Repricing Term Loans bear a lower interest rate and have the same maturity date as the\nExisting Term Loans.\nDRII is required to pay a $2.2 million quarterly principal payment in respect of the Term Loan Facility and a commitment fee, at a rate equal to 0.5%\nper annum, to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of any unutilized commitments thereunder. The interest rate for borrowings under\nthe Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a step-down of 50 basis points per annum based on an achievement of certain net first lien senior secured\nleverage ratios. DRII is also required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees on the daily stated amount of outstanding\nletters of credit and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit. Commencing with the\nyear ended December 31, 2017, the Senior Facilities requires prepayments of excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) which are subject to\nacceptance by the lenders. The Company expects that the required prepayment due in April 2021, if any, will not be material.\nAll obligations under the Senior Facilities are secured by a pledge of DRII\u2019s capital stock and substantially all of DRII\u2019s assets and those of each\nsubsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the domestic subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries that\nare not subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the\ncollateral.\nThe Senior Facilities provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility. On August 12, 2020 and September 16, 2020, the Company entered into\nincremental assumption agreements with certain lenders of the Senior Facilities primarily to extend the maturity of an aggregate $100.0 million of revolving\nfacility commitments from September 2, 2021 to June 2, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $8.0 million was committed to outstanding letters of credit.

These include, but are not limited to, restrictions and limitations relating to its ability\nand the ability of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and other obligations, to make investments and acquisitions, to pay dividends and to repurchase\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires that\nthe Company\u2019s net first lien leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt secured by first-priority liens on the collateral to last years\u2019 Pro Forma\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Senior Facilities) not exceed 3.75 to 1.00. The covenant is only required to be tested on a quarterly basis when the\nRevolving Credit Facility is more than 30% drawn (excluding up to $15.0 million of outstanding letters of credit) and will be a condition to drawings under\nthe Revolving Credit Facility that would result in more than 30% drawn thereunder. The failure of the Company to comply with any of these provisions, or\nto pay its obligations, could result in foreclosure by the lenders of their security interests in the Company\u2019s assets, and could otherwise have a material\nadverse effect on the Company.

The Company has made an accounting policy election to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to leases with terms of 12 months\nor less. With the exception of sales center leases, which contain significant non-lease marketing components, the Company has made an accounting\npolicy election to not separate non-lease components from lease components.\nTypically, the Company\u2019s real estate leases have minimum lease payments that increase over the life of the agreement by a fixed percentage or an\namount based upon the change in a designated index. Certain of the Company\u2019s lease agreements have renewal options and options to purchase the\nleased property which are both at the Company\u2019s sole discretion and generally have not been determined reasonably certain of exercise. The depreciable\nlife of assets are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.\nIf the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate. The Company\u2019s estimate of its\nincremental borrowing rate is calculated on a quarterly basis and incorporates various factors, including United States\u2019 treasury rates and the Company\u2019s\nhistorical borrowing rates adjusted for collateralized borrowings.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s real estate lease agreements include variable payments based on a percentage of revenue or number of tours generated,\nin excess of base rent while others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company\u2019s equipment lease agreements typically\ninclude variable payments based on performance, in excess of base rent.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nyears. The Company\u2019s 2018 effective tax rate was impacted by asset impairment and permanently non-deductible book-tax differences.\nThe Company has considered the income tax accounting and disclosure implications of the relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act enacted on March 27, 2020. The effect of tax law changes is generally required to be recognized in the interim period in\nwhich the legislation is enacted and reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate, depending on the nature of the change. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the Company evaluated the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and has determined there to be an immaterial effect on the\nDecember 31, 2020 computation of the effective income tax rate for the year. The Company will continue to evaluate the income tax provisions of the\nCARES Act and monitor the developments in the jurisdictions where it has significant operations for tax law changes that could have income tax\naccounting and disclosure implications. The Company recorded $6.6 million of employee retention payroll tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act and\nsimilar foreign government programs in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nASC 740 requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carry-forwards be recorded as an asset to the extent\nthat management assesses that realization is \u201cmore-likely-than-not.\u201d Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to\ngenerate sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period, including the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company\nmaintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions, including its branch operations in St. Maarten. Due to the\nCompany\u2019s history of operating losses in those locations, and in the absence of significant objectively-verifiable positive evidence, the Company\nbelieves that realization of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d and,\naccordingly, has provided a valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $500.5 million of unused federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carry-forwards, $300.8 million of unused\nstate NOLs, and $150.0 million of foreign NOLs with expiration dates from 2021 through 2038 (except for certain US and foreign NOLs that do not expire)\nthat may be applied against future taxable income, subject to certain limitations.\nAs a result of prior changes in ownership and the Apollo Merger, the Company\u2019s ability to use its federal NOLs is subject to limitation calculations\nunder Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d), however, the Company is not currently subject to an NOL usage limitation under Section 382.\nOur ability to utilize NOLs loss carryforwards against future U.S. federal taxable income may be limited in the future in the event of a 50% or more\nownership change in our 5% shareholders. Certain state NOLs may be subject to similar limitations.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company\u2019s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a\nrecognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken\nin a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with ASC 740 is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: the Company determines\nwhether it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d recognition threshold,\nthe Company presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.\nThe second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of\nbenefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be\nrealized upon ultimate settlement.\n \nF-38\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

The resorts located in St. Maarten reopened in January 2021 and the closure did not have a material negative financial impact to the\nCompany.\nAcquisition-related Contingencies\nIn connection with an acquisition prior to the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company is required to\npurchase certain seller-retained Vacation Interests notes receivable in exchange for the right to recover the underlying VOIs (the \u201cDefault Recovery\nAgreements\u201d). Amounts due under the Default Recovery Agreements and included in accrued liabilities were $3.8 million and $7.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLitigation Related to the Apollo Merger\nOn October 21, 2016, a purported former stockholder of DRII filed a putative class action in the Court of Chancery in Delaware on behalf of DRII\u2019s\nformer stockholders against its former directors and its former financial advisor (the \u201cDelaware Action\u201d). The plaintiff claimed that the former directors\nbreached their fiduciary duties in approving the tender offer by which affiliates of Apollo acquired DRII in the Apollo Merger, and that the former\nfinancial advisor aided and abetted those alleged breaches. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the former directors improperly approved an incomplete\nsolicitation that was sent to DRII\u2019s stockholders in connection with the tender offer, and failed to take certain required actions in the process preceding\nthe approval of the tender offer. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages. All defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court dismissed all\nclaims in the suit on July 13, 2017. On August 11, 2017, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court of the Court of Chancery\u2019s decision,\nwith such appeal taken as to the dismissal of the claims against DRII\u2019s former directors, but not taken with respect to the dismissal of the claims against\nits former financial advisor. On February 20, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded the case for further proceedings in the\nCourt of Chancery.\nOn August 29, 2018, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which he added another former director and Apollo Management VIII, L.P as\ndefendants alleging that the former director breached his fiduciary duties to DRII\u2019s stockholders and that Apollo Management VIII, L.P., as the acquirer of\nDRII, aided and abetted the directors\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty. On October 15, 2018, Apollo Management VIII, L.P. and another defendant filed motions\nto dismiss the claims alleged against them.\nOn July 23, 2018, another purported former stockholder of DRII filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of\nNevada against DRII and certain of its former directors and officers (the \u201cNevada Action\u201d). The plaintiff alleged that DRII\u2019s disclosures in connection\nwith the Apollo Merger were false and misleading, in violation of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 24, 2018,\nother purported former stockholders of DRII filed a Motion for Appointment of Counsel and for Appointment as Lead Plaintiffs and, on September 26,\n2018, the Court granted the motion. Subsequently, on December 12, 2018, lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which it added another officer of\nDRII as a defendant and alleged additional claims under Section 14(e) as well as Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 9, 2019,\nDRII and all but one of the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\nOn November 1, 2019, the parties in the Delaware Action agreed to a settlement that releases and discharges all of the claims asserted in both the\nDelaware Action and the Nevada Action, and the plaintiffs in the Nevada Action signed an agreement supporting the settlement. The settlement includes\nno admission of liability or fault by any defendant and a settlement payment that will be paid primarily by funds from available insurance and\n \nF-40\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

The Delaware Court of\nChancery entered an order and final judgment approving the settlement on February 20, 2020. On July 13, 2020, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the\nCompany made a final payment of $25.3 million.\nLitigation Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company evaluates these\nlegal proceedings and claims at each balance sheet date to determine the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred, the Company\u2019s ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. The Company records a contingent litigation liability when it\ndetermines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued\nliabilities of $8.2 million and $37.8 million for all legal matters that were contingencies as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For\nthose legal contingencies as to which a loss is reasonably possible and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current\nestimated range is up to approximately $2.9 million in excess of recorded accruals.\nThe Company has also recognized $21.0 million of expected insurance recoveries related to contingent litigation liabilities in other receivables on\nthe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, all amounts have been recovered.\nWhile management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm\nthe Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows, or materially adversely affect overall trends in the Company\u2019s results of operations, legal proceedings are\ninherently uncertain and unfavorable rulings could, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nNote 20\u2014Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities carried at fair value (the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date) are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n \n \n\u2022\n Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n \n \n\u2022\n Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets\u037e quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not\nactive\u037e and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.\n \n \n\u2022\n Level 3: Unobservable inputs used when little or no market data is available.\n \nF-41\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

The fair\nvalue of interest rate swap contracts was $6.3 million and is recognized in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nThe fair value of interest rate swap contracts was $1.8 million and is recognized in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet\nas of December 31, 2019. The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap contracts based on valuation reports provided by the counterparty.\nThe inputs used to measure the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the credit risk data\nused for the valuations, which were not directly observable and could not be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 2\nThe fair value of the borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the First Lien Notes, the Senior Notes, and the securitization notes as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 was determined using quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.\nThe fair value of notes payable, which are included in corporate indebtedness, net, was not calculated because they were either due within one\nyear or were immaterial.\nNote 21\u2014Stock-Based Compensation\nEquity Incentive Plan\nOn November 30, 2016, the Company established an equity incentive plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 10.5 million shares of\nDakota\u2019s common stock for awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and stock options (the \u201cEquity Incentive Plan\u201d) to certain\nemployees or directors of, or consultants to, the Company and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards are subject to performance-based and other\nvesting conditions, and contain a change-of-control provision.\nDakota issues non-qualified stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors of Dakota and its subsidiaries. The non-qualified\nstock option grants have a maximum contractual term of 10 years and exercise prices ranging from $10.00 to $18.88 per share. One-third of the grants\ngenerally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a five-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a \u201cchange in control\u201d and\na grantee\u2019s continued employment on the applicable vesting date (\u201cTranche A Service-Based Grants\u201d). The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model to estimate the fair value of Tranche A Service-Based Grants.\nThe remaining two-thirds of the grants generally vest and become exercisable upon a \u201cchange in control,\u201d provided that certain targeted levels of\nperformance have been achieved (\u201cTranche B Performance-Based Grants\u201d). The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair\nvalue of Tranche B Performance-Based Grants.\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company granted 0.7 million restricted stock units (\u201c2020 RSUs\u201d) and 2.2 million stock options (\u201c2020 Options\u201d) to\ncertain employees under its equity incentive plan. The 2020 RSUs have a weighted average fair value of $11.91 per share, vested in full on the grant date\nand will be settled in common shares no later than March 2021. The 2020 Options have a maximum contractual term of 10 years, vest in equal annual\ninstallments over a three- year period and are subject to accelerated vesting upon a \u201cchange in control\u201d and a grantee\u2019s continued service on the\napplicable vesting date.\n \nF-43\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014Continued\n \nAs of December 31, 2020, 1.2 million shares remained available for issuance as new awards under the Equity Incentive Plan.\nStock Options\nThe Company accounted for its stock-based compensation issued to its employees and non-employee directors (in their capacity as such) in\naccordance with ASC 718, \u201cCompensation\u2014Stock Compensation.\u201d For a stock-based award with service-only vesting conditions, the Company\nmeasured compensation expense at fair value on the grant date and recognized this expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)\nincome over the expected term during which the grantees provided service in exchange for the award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period which they\noccur. Expense related to the Tranche B Performance-Based Grants is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target\nwill be achieved. No compensation expense has been recognized to date since a \u201cchange in control\u201d event has not occurred, nor is it considered\nprobable.\nThe expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock prices for a group of identified peer companies for the expected\nterm of the stock options on the grant date (which was significantly greater than the volatility of the S&P 500\u00ae index as a whole during the same period)\ndue to the lack of historical trading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock. For the Tranche A Service-Based Grants, the average expected option life\nrepresented the period of time the stock options were expected to be outstanding at the issuance date based on management\u2019s estimate. The expected\nterm of the Tranche B Performance-Based Grants was based on the expected time to a liquidity event, such as a \u201cchange in control\u201d event. The risk-free\ninterest rate was calculated based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield, with a remaining term that approximated the expected option life assumed at\nthe date of issuance. The expected annual dividend per share was 0% based on the Company\u2019s expected dividend rate.

Subject to certain limitations, the 401(k) Plan allows participating U.S. employees to defer up to 60.0% of their\neligible compensation on a pre-tax basis. The 401(k) Plan allows the Company to make discretionary matching contributions of up to 50.0% of the first\n6.0% of employee compensation. In March 2020, the Company temporarily eliminated 401(k) matching contributions as a liquidity preservation measure\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company made matching contributions to its 401(k) Plan of $0.7 million, $5.1 million and\n$4.7 million, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company has a self-insured health plan that covers substantially all of its full-time employees in the U.S. The health plan uses\nemployee and employer contributions to pay eligible claims. To supplement this plan, the Company has a stop-loss insurance policy to cover individual\nclaims in excess of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued $4.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for claims that have been\nincurred but not reported.

While certain line items reflected on the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss fall completely into one of these reportable segments, other line items relate to revenues\nor expenses which are applicable to both segments\u037e specifically, other revenue and loan portfolio expense, which are allocated to the appropriate segment\nbased on the nature of the underlying transactions. Certain expense items (principally corporate interest expense, depreciation and amortization and\nprovision for income taxes) are not, in management\u2019s view, allocable to either of these reportable segments, as they apply to the entire Company. In\naddition, general and administrative expenses are not allocated to either of these reportable segments because, historically, management has not allocated\nthese expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the Company\u2019s different operational divisions. Accordingly, these expenses are presented\nunder corporate and other. The Company utilizes revenues and income (loss) before income taxes to assess the performance of its reportable segments.\nManagement believes that it is impracticable to allocate specific assets and liabilities related to each reportable segment. In addition, management\ndoes not review balance sheets by business segment as part of their evaluation of operating segment performance. Consequently, no balance sheet\nsegment reports have been presented.\n \nF-48\nTable of Contents\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.

COMPANY ONLY\nDAKOTA HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1\u2014Business, Background and Basis of Presentation\nBusiness and Background\nDakota Holdings, Inc., (\u201cDakota\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on June 27, 2016 by certain investment funds\naffiliated with or managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC and its subsidiaries (\u201cApollo\u201d), including Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., along with\ntheir parallel investment funds (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d). Dakota and its subsidiaries were established to complete the acquisition of Diamond Resorts\nInternational, Inc. (\u201cDRII\u201d). DRII is a holding company, the principal asset of which is the direct and indirect ownership of equity interests in its\nsubsidiaries, including Diamond Resorts Corporation, the wholly-owned operating subsidiary that has historically conducted the business described\nbelow. Dakota, through its operating subsidiaries, conducts operations and generates income and cash flows, while Dakota conducts no separate\noperations on a standalone basis.\nPrior to the acquisition of DRII on September 2, 2016, Dakota had no operations or activity other than acquisition related costs. Subsequent to the\nApollo Merger (described below), Dakota became the holding company and derives all of its operating income and cash flows from DRII and its\nsubsidiaries.\nBasis of Presentation\nPursuant to the terms of the credit agreements discussed in Note 16 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company and its\nsubsidiaries have restrictions on their ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make distributions to Apollo and the Apollo Funds,\nor make certain intercompany loans and advances. As a result of these restrictions, these parent company financial statements have been prepared in\naccordance with Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X, since the restricted net assets of Dakota\u2019s subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X)\nexceeds 25% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2020.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOn a standalone basis, Dakota records its investment in subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the\ninvestment in subsidiaries is stated at cost plus any contributions and its equity share in undistributed net (loss) income of the subsidiaries minus any\ndividends received. Dakota\u2019s share of net income (loss) of its consolidated subsidiaries is included in net income (loss) on equity investment in\nsubsidiaries in the statements of operations. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying financial information\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the parent financial statements are generally consistent with those used in the preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of DRII, the Company applied the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the fair value adjustments and\ngoodwill recognized from the transactions are recorded in the financial statements of its subsidiaries and presented as part of the Company\u2019s investment\nin subsidiaries on the balance sheet.\n \nF-58\nTable of Contents\nDakota does not currently anticipate paying dividends on common stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of common\nstock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including the Company\u2019s financial condition, earnings, capital\nrequirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board\nof Directors deems relevant. Dakota as a holding company, has no direct operations and its ability to pay dividends is limited to its available cash on\nhand and any funds received from subsidiaries. The terms of the indebtedness may restrict Dakota\u2019s ability to pay dividends, or may restrict the\nsubsidiaries from paying dividends to Dakota. Under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is net assets minus liabilities\nand capital, or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Additionally,\nDakota has not received any dividends from its consolidated subsidiaries.\nNote 2\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nIssuances of Common Stock\nFollowing the Apollo Merger, the Company entered into a Management Investor Rights Agreement (the \u201cMIRA\u201d) with certain employees and non-\nemployee directors of the Company and Apollo. The agreement governs certain aspects of the Company\u2019s relationship with our management\nstockholders, contains transfer restriction on its common stock, and the Company may repurchase outstanding shares when the management\nstockholders\u2019 employment with the Company is terminated.\nNote 3\u2014Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events through March 17, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn March 10, 2021, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cHGV\u201d), Hilton Grand Vacations Borrower LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HGV (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d or \u201cHGV Borrower\u201d), Dakota and the indirect parent company of DRII, that is controlled\nby investment funds and vehicles managed by Apollo, and certain stockholders of Dakota entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger\nAgreement\u201d).

Upon closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d), existing HGV shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined company\nand Apollo will own approximately 28% of the combined company.\nThe Closing is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval of the proposed issuance of HGV Common Shares in connection with the\nMerger (the \u201cShare Issuance\u201d) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matter at a special\nmeeting of stockholders (the \u201cHGV Stockholder Approval\u201d), (ii) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino\nAntitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) and the obtaining or filing of any consents, declarations or filings with antitrust\nauthorities in Mexico and Austria, (iii) the absence of certain legal restraints, (iv) the accuracy of the parties\u2019 respective representations and warranties\ncontained in the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality thresholds), (v) the material performance of the parties\u2019 respective covenants\ncontained in the Merger Agreement, (vi) conditions relating to the absence of defaults under Dakota\u2019s unsecured notes and absence of defaults and\nsufficient availability under Dakota\u2019s warehouse facilities, (vii) certain ancillary agreements having been delivered and not having been rescinded or\nrepudiated by certain parties, (viii) the approval of listing on the NYSE of the HGV Common Shares included in the Merger Consideration, subject only to\nofficial notice of issuance and (ix) the absence of any Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on HGV and (x) the absence\nof any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on Dakota.\nThe parties have made customary representations and warranties, and agreed to customary covenants, in the Merger Agreement, including\nregarding (i) the conduct of Dakota\u2019s and HGV\u2019s respective businesses during the pre-Closing period, (ii) subject to certain qualifications as set forth in\nthe Merger Agreement, the parties\u2019 use of their respective reasonable best efforts to effect the expiration or termination of the required waiting period\nunder the HSR Act, obtain all other required regulatory approvals and otherwise consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement as promptly as practicable and (iii) HGV\u2019s obligation to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), as\npromptly as reasonably practical after the date of the Merger Agreement, a definitive proxy statement with respect to a special meeting of its common\nstockholders to be convened for purposes of obtaining the HGV Stockholder Approval, which will contain, subject to certain exceptions, the\nrecommendation of the board of directors of HGV that HGV common\n \nF-60\nTable of Contents\nstockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the stockholders of Dakota will severally but not\njointly indemnify HGV for certain matters, including breaches of fundamental representations and covenants and certain pre-closing tax matters.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for HGV and Dakota, including (i) by either party (A) if the Merger is not consummated\non or before September 10, 2021 (subject to extension to December 9, 2021, under certain circumstances), (B) in the event of a material uncured breach by\nthe other party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement, (C) in the event a final, non-appealable order or law\nprohibits the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (D) if HGV does not obtain the HGV Stockholder Approval\u037e\n(ii) by HGV if the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has not been obtained and delivered to HGV by no later than 24\nhours after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and (iii) by Dakota (A) in the event that, subject to certain conditions, HGV does not\nconsummate the Merger when required pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (B) prior to the time the HGV Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the board\nof directors of HGV (or a committee thereof) has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation in favor of the Share Issuance.

Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf\nof such Selling Holder or any Indemnified Party and will survive any termination of this Agreement.\n(b) Indemnification by Selling Holders. The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration\nstatement filed in accordance with Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from any\nSelling Holder to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 5.5(a)) the Company or any prospective\nunderwriter, as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers and controlling Persons, with respect to any untrue statement in\nor omission from such registration statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement, if such\nuntrue statement or omission was made in conformity with written information with respect to such Selling Holder furnished to the Company by such\nSelling Holder expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement,\nor a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation\nmade by or on behalf of the Company or any of the other sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or controlling Persons and will\nsurvive the Transfer of such Registrable Securities by the Selling Holder. In no event shall the liability of any Selling Holder hereunder be greater in\namount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such\nindemnification obligation.\n(c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or\nproceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 5.5, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect\nthereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action\u037e provided that the failure of the\nIndemnified Party to give notice as provided herein will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 5.5(a) or Section 5.5(b), except\nto the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an Indemnified\nParty, unless in such Indemnified Party\u2019s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in\nrespect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party\nsimilarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel selected by the holders of at least a majority of the securities included in the relevant\nregistration statement, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to\n \nB-28\nTable of Contents\nassume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by\nthe latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If, in such Indemnified Party\u2019s reasonable judgment, having\ncommon counsel would result in a conflict of interest between the interests of such indemnified and indemnifying parties, then such Indemnified Party\nmay employ separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party to represent or defend such Indemnified Party in such action, it being\nunderstood, however, that the indemnifying party will not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at\nany time for all such Indemnified Parties (and not more than one separate firm of local counsel at any time for all such Indemnified Parties) in such action.\nNo indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the\ngiving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.\n(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for hereunder from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder\nin respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein for reasons other than those described in the proviso in the first\nsentence of Section 5.5(a), then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by\nsuch Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault\nof the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as\nwell as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties shall be determined by reference\nto, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged\nomission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or Indemnified Parties, and the parties\u2019\nrelative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party under this\nSection 5.5(d) as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or\nexpenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. In no event shall the liability of any Selling Holder\nhereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder upon the sale of the Registrable\nSecurities giving rise to such contribution obligation. Any obligation of Selling Holder to contribute pursuant to this Section 5.5(d) shall be several in\nproportion to the amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.\nThe parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation\nor by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No\nPerson guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person\nwho was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.\nIf indemnification is available under Section 5.5(a), the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each Indemnified Party to the full extent provided in\nSection 5.5(a) without regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying party or Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in this\nSection 5.5(d).\n(e) Other Indemnification. Indemnification substantially similar to that specified in this Section 5.5 (with appropriate modifications) shall be\ngiven by the Company and each Selling Holder with respect to any required registration or other qualification of such securities under any Law or with\nany Governmental Authority other than as required by the Securities Act.\n(f) Non-Exclusivity. The obligations of the parties under this Section 5.5 will be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise\nhave to any other party.\n \nB-29\nTable of Contents\nARTICLE VI",
