As a result of the voting standard for the Minority Shareholder Approval, if you fail to vote\n(including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special general meeting to vote your\nMyovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your\nMyovant common shares) or if you abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal, the effect will be the same as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal. Pursuant to the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and consistent with the\nMerger Agreement, Sumitovant has agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of the Myovant common shares that\nit or its affiliates (other than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the approval of the\nMerger Proposal and all other proposals presented at the special general meeting. If Sumitovant votes in\ncompliance with the terms of the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, the General Shareholder Approval will be\nobtained, but such vote will have no effect on the Minority Shareholder Approval.\nCompensation Proposal\nThe Compensation Proposal requires approval by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding\nMyovant common shares entitled to vote on such matter and voting at the special general meeting. For the\nCompensation Proposal, only votes \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d will be counted as a vote cast.

If you fail to vote (including if you do not submit a validly executed proxy or attend the special\ngeneral meeting to vote your Myovant common shares, or if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other\nnominee how to vote your Myovant common shares), your Myovant common shares will not be counted in\ndetermining, and will have no effect on, the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If you abstain from voting on\nthe Adjournment Proposal, the effect will be the same as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWith respect to the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the Compensation Proposal, why am I being\nasked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the\nnamed executive officers of Myovant in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require us to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to certain categories of compensation\nthat may be provided to named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Myovant shareholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. This vote is an\nadvisory vote and will not be binding on Myovant. Therefore, if the Merger Proposal is approved by the General\nShareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval and the Merger is completed, the payments that\nare the subject of the vote may become payable to the named executive officers regardless of the outcome of\nsuch vote.\nQ:\nWhat is the quorum requirement?\nA:\nA quorum of shareholders is necessary to conduct business at the special general meeting. A quorum will be\npresent if holders of Myovant common shares representing a majority of the issued and outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares entitled to vote at the special general meeting as of the record date are present or\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresented by proxy at the special general meeting. Your Myovant common shares will be counted toward the\nquorum only if you submit a validly executed proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or\nother nominee) or if you vote at the special general meeting. Abstentions will be counted toward the quorum\nrequirement.\nQ:\nWhat if I do not vote?\nA:\nIf you are a record holder and you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any\nparticular proposal, the Myovant common shares represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by\nthe Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special\nCommittee) with respect to that proposal. Unless a Myovant shareholder of record checks the box on his, her or\nits proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the applicable proxy holders may use their discretion to vote\non other matters relating to the special general meeting, as applicable.\nFor purposes of the special general meeting, an abstention occurs when a Myovant shareholder of record\nattends the special general meeting and does not vote or returns a proxy with an \u201cabstain\u201d instruction.\n1)\nMerger Proposal: As a result of the voting standard for the Minority Shareholder Approval, an\nabstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\n2)\nCompensation Proposal: An abstention will not count as a vote cast \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d such\nproposal. If a Myovant shareholder is not present at the special general meeting and does not\nrespond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Compensation Proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present).\n3)\nAdjournment Proposal: An abstention will have the same effect as a vote cast \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nAdjournment Proposal. If a Myovant shareholder is not present at the special general meeting and\ndoes not respond by proxy, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Adjournment Proposal\n(assuming a quorum is present).\nQ:\nIf my shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other\nnominee vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. In accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), banks, brokers and other\nnominees who hold Myovant common shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d for their customers do not have discretionary\nauthority to vote those shares with respect to the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal. Accordingly, if banks, brokers or other nominees do not receive specific voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owners of those shares, they are not permitted to vote those shares with respect\nto any of the proposals to be voted upon at the special general meeting. As a result, if you hold your Myovant\ncommon shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not provide voting instructions, your Myovant common shares will\n(i) not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special general meeting, (ii)\nassuming a quorum is present, have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal with respect to\nthe Minority Shareholder Approval, and (iii) assuming a quorum is present, have no effect on the Merger\nProposal with respect to the General Shareholder Approval, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment\nProposal.\nQ:\nWhat will Myovant\u2019s shareholders receive in the Merger?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed, holders of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (i)\nDissenting Holders, (ii) Sumitovant or (iii) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive\n$27.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each Myovant common share they\nhold immediately prior to the effective time, and any such Myovant common shares will cease to exist, and each\nholder of such Myovant common shares will have no other rights with respect thereto as of the effective time.\nQ:\nWhat will holders of Myovant options, Myovant RSUs and Myovant PSUs receive in the Merger?\nA:\nEach option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and\nunexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprice per Myovant common share that is less than $27.00 will be cancelled and converted into the right to\nreceive a cash payment for each Myovant common share that is subject to such option equal to the difference\nbetween $27.00 and the per share exercise price of such option (without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes). Each option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is\noutstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has\nan exercise price per Myovant common share that is equal to or greater than $27.00 will be cancelled without\npayment.

Immediately following the effective time, there will\nbe no stock options to purchase Myovant common shares, Myovant RSUs or Myovant PSUs outstanding, and\nthe former holders thereof will only be entitled to receive the amounts set forth above.\nQ:\nHow does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the Myovant common shares\nprior to the announcement of the Merger?\nA:\nThe per share merger consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per\nMyovant common share on September 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of\nSumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant\ndoes not already own, on which date the closing price was $17.96), (ii) a premium of approximately 48.4% to the\n30-calendar day volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) per Myovant common share through September 30,\n2022 (which was $18.19) and (iii) a premium of approximately 13.1% to the 52-week high trading price of the\nMyovant common shares as of September 30, 2022 (which was $23.87).\nQ:\nWhy are the Special Committee and the Myovant Board proposing the Merger?\nA:\nThe Special Committee and the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves),\nacting at the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, have determined that the terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement are fair to and in the best interest of Myovant and its shareholders, and that the $27.00 per share\nmerger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share. To review the reasons for the\nproposed Merger in greater detail, see \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special\nCommittee and the Myovant Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 34.\nQ:\nHow does the Special Committee and the Myovant Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Special Committee and the Myovant Board acting at the unanimous recommendation of the Special\nCommittee each recommends that our shareholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nYou should read the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special\nCommittee and the Myovant Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 34 for a discussion\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the factors that the Special Committee and the Myovant Board considered, respectively, in deciding to\nrecommend and adopt and approve the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and\nthe other the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and\nthe Sumitovant Voting Agreement.

Myovant\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or\nin addition to, the interests of Myovant shareholders. See the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Interests of\nMyovant\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 69. The members of the Special\nCommittee and the Myovant Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in\nevaluating the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement and in recommending that Myovant shareholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Compensation\nProposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWill Sumitovant and its affiliates vote their shares in favor of the Merger Proposal at the special general\nmeeting?\nA:\nYes.

After the\nMerger, the Myovant common shares will cease to be listed on the NYSE, and price quotations with respect to\nsales of Myovant common shares in the public market will no longer be available. In addition, registration of the\nMyovant common shares under the Exchange Act will be terminated.\nFor more information, please see the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Certain Effects of the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 61.\nQ:\nWho will own Myovant after the Merger?\nA:\nAfter the Merger, Myovant will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant.

(\u201cRoivant\u201d), then the holder of 40,765,599 Myovant common\nshares (approximately 45.5% of the outstanding Myovant common shares as of such date), and certain of their\naffiliates entered into a definitive transaction agreement (the \u201cRoivant Transaction Agreement\u201d) governing a strategic\nalliance (the \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d) involving the acquisition by SMP of Roivant\u2019s interests in certain pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including the Myovant common shares owned by Roivant immediately prior to the closing of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Roivant Transaction Agreement (the \u201cRoivant Closing\u201d).\nOn December 27, 2019, pursuant to the Roivant Transaction Agreement, Roivant contributed to Sumitovant,\nthen a wholly owned subsidiary of Roivant, all of the Myovant common shares owned by Roivant (including an\nadditional 4,243,005 Myovant common shares (or approximately 4.7% of the outstanding Myovant common shares as\nof such date)) (the \u201ctop up shares\u201d) that were acquired by Roivant from a third party prior to the Roivant Closing to\nensure that SMP would indirectly own a majority of Myovant\u2019s outstanding common shares upon the Roivant\nClosing. Immediately following such contribution, Roivant transferred all of the outstanding equity interests of\nSumitovant to SMP. As a result of these transactions, SMP, through its ownership of Sumitovant, became the indirect\nbeneficial owner of a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares.\nIn connection with SMP\u2019s and Sumitovant\u2019s acquisition of such Myovant common shares from Roivant, on\nDecember 27, 2019:\n\u2022\nMyovant and SMP entered into a $400 million unsecured revolving debt financing agreement with SMP as\nthe lender (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nMyovant, Sumitovant and SMP entered into the Investor Rights Agreement containing, among other\nthings, (i) protections for Myovant\u2019s minority shareholders for so long as SMP and its controlled affiliates\n(including Sumitovant) beneficially own 50% or more of the total number of votes entitled to be cast at\nelections of Myovant\u2019s directors and (ii) a right for SMP and its controlled affiliates (including Sumitovant)\nto designate the three Sumitomo Directors to the Myovant Board, which directors are currently Myrtle\nPotter, Adele Gulfo and Shigeyuki Nishinaka. The minority shareholder protections included in the Investor\nRights Agreement include a standstill provision (the \u201cStandstill Provision\u201d) prohibiting any member of the\nSumitomo Group from making a tender offer, exchange offer, merger proposal or other offer the effect of\nwhich (if completed) would increase SMP\u2019s beneficial ownership to over 60% of the outstanding voting\npower of Myovant or acquiring all or substantially all of Myovant\u2019s assets (an \u201cAcquisition Transaction\u201d)\nunless such Acquisition Transaction is effected in accordance with specified requirements, including (i)\napproval by a majority of the common shares held by shareholders other than SMP and its affiliates and (ii)\nif the Acquisition Transaction occurs on or prior to December 27, 2022, approval by a majority of the\nmembers then serving on the Audit Committee (each of whom is independent and not affiliated with SMP or\nits affiliates)\u037e and\n\u2022\nRoivant, Sumitovant and SMP entered into a share return agreement (the \u201cShare Return Agreement\u201d)\npursuant to which SMP agreed, among other things, to return to Roivant the number of top up shares that\nwould result in SMP beneficially owning in excess of 55% of the outstanding Myovant common shares,\nwith such beneficial ownership measured as of March 1 of each calendar year.\nFor additional information regarding the Loan Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement and certain other\nagreements between Myovant and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sumitomo Group and its affiliates, on\nthe other hand, please see the section entitled \u201cOther Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-\nTransactions Between Myovant and the Purchaser Filing Persons.\u201d\n23TABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrom the Roivant Closing through September 28, 2021, Sumitovant acquired additional Myovant common shares\nin the open market under a securities purchase plan entered into by Sumitovant on March 13, 2020, and a securities\npurchase plan entered into by Sumitovant on May 14, 2021 (the \u201c2021 10b5-1 Trading Plan\u201d) in each case with\nCitigroup Global Markets, Inc. (\u201cCGMI\u201d) pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.\nSince the Roivant Closing, members of Myovant\u2019s management team and representatives of Sumitovant have\nmet periodically to discuss Myovant\u2019s business and operations, developments related to Myovant\u2019s products and\nother matters.\nIn addition, Myovant\u2019s management and the Myovant Board, including the Sumitomo Directors, have regularly\nreviewed and assessed strategic opportunities and alternatives and Myovant\u2019s operations, performance, prospects\nand strategy in light of current and anticipated business and economic conditions, as well as developments in the\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, with a view towards enhancing shareholder value. Such opportunities\nand alternatives include, among other things, remaining as a stand-alone entity, potential acquisitions of other\ncompanies or businesses in the industry in which Myovant operates, joint ventures and other strategic alliances and\nother transactions. Separately, SMP and Sumitovant, as beneficial owners of a majority of the outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares, reviewed their investment in Myovant on a continuing basis based on various factors, including,\nwithout limitation, the contractual restrictions in the Investor Rights Agreement (including the Standstill Provision),\nMyovant\u2019s financial position, results of operations, conditions in the securities market and general economic and\nindustry conditions.\nOn April 8, 2020, Myovant, Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Sumitovant entered into a Nondisclosure and Common\nInterest Agreement (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, in accordance with its terms, the\n\u201cNondisclosure and Common Interest Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the parties agreed to share certain\nconfidential information.\nOn May 18, 2020, Myovant and Sumitovant entered into a consulting agreement (the \u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d),\nwhich was amended on November 9, 2020, pursuant to which Sumitovant agreed to provide consulting services to\nMyovant to support Myovant in commercial planning, commercial launch activities and implementation. The term of\nthe Consulting Agreement expired on March 31, 2021.\nOn February 2, 2022, Sumitovant, Myovant, Myovant Sciences GmbH and Myovant Sciences, Inc. entered into\na Services and Information Sharing Agreement (the \u201cInformation Sharing Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which, among\nother things, Myovant agreed, for so long as Sumitovant, together with its affiliates, is a majority owner of Myovant,\nto supply certain information summarizing material aspects of Myovant\u2019s business to Sumitovant, and with\nreasonable advanced notice, give Sumitovant and its representatives the reasonable opportunity to discuss such\ninformation with Myovant\u2019s senior management. For additional information regarding the Information Sharing\nAgreement, please see section entitled \u201cOther Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Transactions\nBetween Myovant and the Purchaser Filing Persons.\u201d\nOn April 4, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP submitted a letter to the Audit Committee requesting access to conduct\ndue diligence on Myovant\u2019s business in connection with Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s evaluation of the possibility of\nsubmitting a proposal to acquire the remaining common shares of Myovant that Sumitovant did not already own, and\nstating that it had retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d) as its financial advisor and Sullivan &\nCromwell LLP (\u201cSullivan & Cromwell\u201d) as its counsel. In the letter, Sumitovant and SMP also noted that if they\ndetermined to make a proposal, such proposal and any possible transaction following such proposal would comply\nwith the requirements set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement, including that the proposal would be subject to the\naffirmative approval by a majority of the independent directors comprising the Audit Committee and a non-waivable\ncondition requiring the approval of Myovant shareholders holding a majority of the Myovant common shares not\nowned by Sumitovant.\nOn April 6, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP provided the Audit Committee with a list of high priority requests for\nmaterials and information, and also requested that Myovant grant Sumitovant and its affiliates and advisors\npermission to use previously provided information in connection with their due diligence review.\nAlso on April 6, 2022, Myovant and Pfizer Inc. (\u201cPfizer\u201d) received a deficiencies letter from the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) regarding their supplemental New Drug Application (\u201csNDA\u201d) for MYFEMBREE\u00ae,\nfor the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 15, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cooley LLP (\u201cCooley\u201d), counsel to Myovant, in attendance, to discuss the\nrequests received from Sumitovant and SMP and the appropriate response. Following this discussion, the Audit\nCommittee authorized Mark Guinan, Chairman of the Audit Committee, to contact Myrtle Potter, in her capacity as\nChief Executive Officer of Sumitovant, to discuss narrowing the scope of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s requests, in an\neffort to minimize the diversion of management time and attention that would need to be devoted to the diligence\nprocess prior to receiving a potential proposal and preliminary indication of value for Myovant from Sumitovant and\nSMP.\nOn April 18, 2022, as authorized by the Audit Committee, Mr. Guinan spoke with Ms. Potter regarding the list of\nhigh priority diligence requests that Sumitovant and SMP had provided on April 6. Mr. Guinan communicated that the\nmembers of the Audit Committee had not made a determination about whether it was an opportune time for Myovant\nto consider strategic alternatives such as a possible transaction with Sumitovant and SMP and, accordingly, wished\nto limit the amount of Myovant management\u2019s time and attention that would potentially be devoted to the diligence\nprocess prior to receiving a preliminary indication of value for Myovant, noting that Sumitovant already had\nsignificant knowledge about Myovant through its information and access rights pursuant to the Information Sharing\nAgreement and designees serving on the Myovant Board. Ms. Potter indicated the items requested by Sumitovant\nand SMP were necessary to evaluate whether they would pursue a possible transaction with Myovant, but expressed\na willingness to narrow the scope of the requests at that stage. Ms. Potter also indicated that Sumitovant and SMP\nwere not in a position to provide a preliminary indication of value with respect to a possible transaction until\nSumitovant progressed its diligence.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cooley and Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited (\u201cConyers\u201d), Bermuda counsel to\nMyovant. At the meeting, Mr. Guinan updated the other members of the Audit Committee on his discussion with Ms.\nPotter on April 18 regarding Sumitovant\u2019s list of high priority diligence requests. Conyers reviewed directors\u2019 duties\nunder Bermuda law. The members of the Audit Committee also discussed the engagement of a financial advisor to\nprovide advice with respect to matters relating to a possible transaction with Sumitovant and SMP. Following\ndiscussion of these matters, based on, among other things, Goldman Sachs\u2019 qualifications, experience and reputation,\nthe Audit Committee authorized management to seek a proposal from Goldman Sachs to serve as financial advisor to\nthe independent directors serving on the Audit Committee and to obtain relationship disclosure from Goldman Sachs\nwith respect to Sumitovant and SMP to be presented to the Audit Committee.\nOn April 28, 2022, the Myovant Board held a meeting by teleconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement in attendance to, among other things, consider the formation of a special committee consisting of the\nthree independent directors serving on the Audit Committee to oversee matters relating to a possible proposal from\nSumitovant and SMP. Following discussion, the Myovant Board (a) approved the formation of the Special Committee,\nconsisting of Mr. Guinan, Terrie Curran and Nancy Valente, M.D. (the three independent directors serving on the\nAudit Committee), with Mr. Guinan serving as the Chairman of the Special Committee, and (b) empowered the Special\nCommittee to (i) review and evaluate any proposal from Sumitovant or its affiliates in order to make a recommendation\nto the Myovant Board regarding whether Myovant should seek to engage in a potential transaction with Sumitovant,\n(ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in a potential transaction with Sumitovant, develop and\nnegotiate the terms and make a recommendation to the full Myovant Board regarding whether Myovant should enter\ninto such potential transaction, (iii) identify, review and evaluate available alternatives to a potential transaction with\nSumitovant, including remaining a separate company, and (iv) recommend to the Myovant Board what further\nactions, if any, should be taken with respect to a potential transaction with Sumitovant or any alternative thereto. The\nresolutions of the Myovant Board authorizing the formation of the Special Committee provided that the Myovant\nBoard would not recommend, authorize or approve any transaction with Sumitovant unless the Special Committee\nrecommended such transaction.\nImmediately following the board meeting on April 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by\nvideoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s management and representatives of Cooley in attendance. The Special\nCommittee discussed the engagement of a financial advisor and counsel for the Special Committee. Following\ndiscussion (including review of the proposed forms of engagement letters with such advisors and disclosures\nregarding any potential conflicts of interest such advisors may have with respect to a potential transaction involving\nSumitovant), the Special Committee determined such advisors were not disqualified from\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbeing engaged by the Special Committee by virtue of any potential conflicts of interest with respect to a potential\ntransaction with Sumitovant and SMP and approved the engagement of Goldman Sachs, Cooley and Conyers. The\nSpecial Committee also discussed the list of high priority diligence requests received from Sumitovant and SMP, and\nreviewed the feedback that had already been provided to Sumitovant by Mr. Guinan prior to the meeting as well as a\nproposed response letter from the Special Committee to Sumitovant regarding the diligence requests. Following such\ndiscussion, the Special Committee approved the proposed response letter and authorized Mr. Guinan to deliver an\nexecuted copy of the letter to Sumitovant on behalf of the Special Committee.\nOn April 29, 2022, the Special Committee and Myovant executed an engagement letter for Goldman Sachs to\nserve as financial advisor to the Special Committee. The Special Committee\u2019s decision to engage Goldman Sachs was\nbased on, among other things, Goldman Sachs\u2019 qualifications, experience and reputation, including Goldman Sachs\u2019\nextensive experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and the Special Committee\u2019s determination,\nbased on disclosures provided by Goldman Sachs on April 23, 2022 with respect to any material relationships with\neither Sumitovant or SMP, that Goldman Sachs did not have any material conflicts.\nOn April 29, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP provided the Special Committee with a revised list of high priority\nrequests for materials and information it sought as part of its due diligence process and evaluation of whether to\npursue a potential proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Myovant that Sumitovant did not already own.\nOn May 5, 2022, the Audit Committee held a meeting, after which the members of the Special Committee (whose\nmembers are identical to those of the Audit Committee) discussed the status of the high priority diligence requests\nand a potential response.\nOn May 21, 2022, Mr. Guinan, on behalf of the Special Committee, sent a letter to Yuichiro Haruyama, then-\ncurrent Chief Financial Officer of Sumitovant, in response to Sumitovant\u2019s letters provided on April 4, 2022 and April\n6, 2022, regarding the possibility of Sumitovant and SMP submitting a potential acquisition proposal and related\ndiligence requests. The letter informed Sumitovant that after carefully considering Sumitovant\u2019s requests, it was not\nclear to the Special Committee that it was an opportune time for Myovant to consider strategic alternatives such as a\npotential transaction with Sumitovant and, accordingly, that the Special Committee wished to limit the amount of\nMyovant management\u2019s time and attention that would potentially be devoted to the diligence process, including\nbecause Sumitovant already had significant knowledge about Myovant. The letter also stated that the Special\nCommittee had no desire to hinder Sumitovant\u2019s consideration of a possible proposal and was therefore willing to\nrespond to a subset of the information requests provided by Sumitovant. The responses to that subset of the\ninformation requests were provided to Sumitovant along with the letter, and the Special Committee further authorized\nmanagement to provide additional due diligence information to Sumitovant and SMP. The letter also noted that the\nSpecial Committee was permitting Sumitovant and its affiliates and advisors to use information previously provided\nto Sumitovant for purposes of conducting due diligence on Myovant\u2019s business in connection with Sumitovant\u2019s\nand SMP\u2019s ongoing review of whether to pursue a possible transaction.\nFollowing Mr. Guinan\u2019s May 21 letter, between May 21, 2022 and the execution of the Merger Agreement on\nOctober 23, 2022, Myovant\u2019s management provided due diligence information to Sumitovant and its advisors at the\ndirection of the Special Committee as part of an ongoing process.\nOn June 28, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d) in\nattendance. Prior to representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden joining the meeting, the Special Committee\ndetermined to retain Skadden to serve as counsel to the Special Committee, based on, among other things, Skadden\u2019s\nqualifications, experience and reputation and the absence of conflicts on the part of Skadden. While the Special\nCommittee did not believe that Cooley was disqualified from acting as its legal counsel by virtue of any potential\nconflicts of interest related to Cooley\u2019s prior or ongoing representation of Myovant, the Special Committee\ndetermined to retain Skadden as legal counsel for the potential transaction with Sumitovant and SMP based on\nSkadden\u2019s qualifications, experience and reputation in providing legal advice in connection with situations involving\nthe type of transaction that Sumitovant and SMP indicated they were considering. Representatives of Goldman Sachs\nand Myovant\u2019s management reviewed information provided to Sumitovant as part of its ongoing due diligence\nprocess. Myovant\u2019s management also reviewed preliminary\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nillustrative financial projections for Myovant that were prepared by management at the request of the Special\nCommittee (the \u201cInitial Projections\u201d), based on the original preliminary five-year projections that had been presented\nby management to the Myovant Board earlier in the year as part of Myovant\u2019s regular long-range planning process,\nand key assumptions underlying those projections. The Initial Projections assumed, among other things, FDA\napproval of Myovant\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s sNDA for MYFEMBREE\u00ae for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-\nmenopausal women.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special Committee discussed\nthe Initial Projections prepared by Myovant\u2019s management that were previously presented by Goldman Sachs to the\nSpecial Committee on June 28 and the assumptions underlying those projections, and provided feedback to\nmanagement regarding the Initial Projections and underlying assumptions.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Skadden and Cooley in attendance. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs provided an update on the information provided to Sumitovant in connection with its ongoing due diligence\nprocess, and informed the Special Committee that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of Sumitovant and SMP, had advised\nthem that if Sumitovant and SMP were to proceed to make a proposal they would only do so after Myovant and Pfizer\nreceived a decision from the FDA regarding their sNDA for MYFEMBREE\u00ae for use in the treatment of endometriosis\nin pre-menopausal women. Myovant\u2019s management and representatives of Cooley reviewed information to assist the\nSpecial Committee in evaluating the loss of patent exclusivity assumptions used in the Initial Projections.\nManagement and the advisors reviewed the underlying assumptions used in the Initial Projections prepared by\nMyovant\u2019s management, including with respect to the assumed exclusivity periods associated with Myovant\u2019s\npatent portfolio. After discussion, the Special Committee provided feedback to management and Goldman Sachs\nregarding potential revisions to such underlying assumptions.\nOn August 2, 2022, Mr. Guinan, on behalf of the Special Committee, circulated to Myovant\u2019s senior management\na memorandum regarding certain guidelines for management in connection with the potential receipt of a proposal\nfrom Sumitovant and SMP, including guidelines with respect to the confidentiality of the Special Committee process\nand any interactions between Myovant\u2019s senior management and Sumitovant and/or SMP in connection with a\npossible transaction. Thereafter, senior management acknowledged that they would comply with the guidelines set\nforth in the memorandum.\nOn August 3, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with members of Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of management and\nGoldman Sachs reviewed management\u2019s revised preliminary illustrative financial projections, which had been updated\nto reflect revisions made following the July 7, 2022 and July 26, 2022 meetings and did not change thereafter (the\n\u201cRevised Projections\u201d) and the underlying assumptions, and representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed preliminary\nillustrative financial analyses based on such projections, including certain sensitivity analyses. The Revised\nProjections assumed, among other things, FDA approval of Myovant\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s sNDA for MYFEMBREE\u00ae for use\nin the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.\nOn August 5, 2022, Myovant and Pfizer publicly announced receipt of FDA approval of Myovant\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s\nsNDA for MYFEMBREE\u00ae for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal women.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special Committee discussed the Revised Projections prepared by Myovant\u2019s\nmanagement and the preliminary illustrative financial analyses, including sensitivity analyses, performed by Goldman\nSachs.\nOn August 22, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the Special Committee on\ncommunications with representatives of J.P. Morgan regarding Sumitovant\u2019s evaluation of whether to pursue a\npossible transaction, including with respect to due diligence information. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also\nreviewed the Revised Projections as well as certain sensitivity analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs as requested by\nthe Special Committee at the August 12 meeting, and recent changes in market conditions and the trading price of\nMyovant common shares. The Special Committee instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to use the Revised\nProjections prepared by Myovant\u2019s management in Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyses. Representatives of Skadden reviewed\nlegal matters, including an overview of certain terms typically included in merger agreements\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninvolving a minority buyout of a public company by a majority shareholder. The Special Committee also discussed\nwith representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden the possibility of conducting outreach to potential third parties\nother than Sumitovant in advance of receiving a proposal from Sumitovant, during which discussion the Special\nCommittee considered, among other things, the risk that Sumitovant and SMP would be unwilling to support a sale of\nMyovant to a third party which could make any outreach futile, the likelihood that few parties other than one of\nMyovant to a third party which could make any outreach futile, the likelihood that few parties other than one of\nMyovant\u2019s current commercial partners would be interested in a transaction and the potential negative impact on\nMyovant and its relationships with third parties if such outreach were to become known, that the Special Committee\ncould determine to reach out to third parties at a later time, and the expectation that any merger agreement that might\nultimately be entered into with Sumitovant would be expected to allow the Special Committee to consider unsolicited\ninbound acquisition proposals that might be made. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined not to\nreach out to third parties at that time.\nOn September 15, 2022, the Special Committee held an in person meeting (which Mr. Guinan joined by\nvideoconference), with David Marek, Myovant\u2019s Principal Executive Officer, Uneek Mehra, Myovant\u2019s Principal\nFinancial Officer and Matthew Lang, Myovant\u2019s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance by videoconference. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an\nupdate to the Special Committee on their interactions with J.P. Morgan, including regarding due diligence and the\nevaluation process being conducted by Sumitovant and SMP of a possible transaction. Representatives of Skadden\nprovided an overview of the types of interim operating restrictions that would be expected to apply to Myovant\u2019s\nbusiness operations between the signing and closing of a possible transaction with Sumitovant and of employee\nretention considerations to protect Myovant\u2019s business against disruption and loss of employees during the period\nbetween the signing and closing of a possible transaction. The Special Committee requested management to work\nwith Skadden to prepare a recommendation for the Special Committee regarding a possible employee retention\nproposal if Sumitovant and SMP were to make a proposal.\nAlso on September 15, 2022, the Myovant Board held a regularly scheduled in person meeting, with\nmanagement in attendance (with certain participants in attendance by videoconference). During the meeting,\nmanagement presented to the Myovant Board a financial update based on year-to-date results, which included an\nupdate on projected fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX\u00ae revenues, which were likely to be lower than reflected in the\nprojections for fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX\u00ae revenues previously provided by management to the Myovant Board.\nOn September 16, 2022 and September 26, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan held calls to\ndiscuss the status of due diligence and the process being conducted by Sumitovant and SMP to evaluate whether to\npursue a possible transaction with Myovant. Following the September 26 call, J.P. Morgan provided an updated list\nof high priority diligence requests to Goldman Sachs on behalf of Sumitovant and SMP.\nAfter the close of trading on September 30, 2022, Ms. Potter contacted Mr. Guinan to communicate that the\nspecial committee of the board of directors of Sumitovant had met earlier that day and intended to provide a proposal\nletter (the \u201cproposal letter\u201d) and that Sullivan & Cromwell would be delivering a draft of the Merger Agreement.\nShortly thereafter, Ms. Potter delivered the proposal letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the\nMyovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $22.75 per share in cash, reflecting a 26.7% premium\nto Myovant\u2019s last closing price per share of $17.96. In the proposal letter, Sumitovant and SMP stated that they were\nonly interested in acquiring additional Myovant common shares and not interested in selling any of the Myovant\ncommon shares that Sumitovant owned or supporting any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving\nMyovant. The proposal letter further noted that, consistent with the Investor Rights Agreement, the proposed\ntransaction would be subject to the approval of the Audit Committee and a non-waivable condition requiring the\napproval of Myovant\u2019s shareholders holding a majority of Myovant\u2019s outstanding common shares that are not\nowned by Sumitovant. Sumitovant also stated that in compliance with its obligations under Section 13(d) of the\nExchange Act, Sumitovant would be required to promptly file an amendment to its Schedule 13D to reflect the\ncontents of the proposal letter. Later in the evening on September 30, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell provided an initial\ndraft of the Merger Agreement to Skadden.\nAfter receipt of the proposal letter and draft of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee held a meeting by\nvideoconference on October 1, 2022, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. The Special\nCommittee received an update on communications with Sumitovant and its advisors and discussed the proposal\nletter, including the offer price and other terms of the proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented financial\nanalyses to the Special Committee based on Myovant\u2019s management projections that the Special Committee had\npreviously instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to use in its\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalyses, and representatives of Skadden reviewed certain legal considerations relating to the proposal and provided\nan overview of the terms of the draft Merger Agreement received from Sullivan & Cromwell. Following evaluation and\ndiscussion of the offer price and other terms of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal, the Special Committee\nunanimously determined that Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal significantly undervalued Myovant and, therefore,\nwas not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders. The Special Committee determined not to engage further\non Sumitovant\u2019s due diligence requests or the draft Merger Agreement based on Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal\nand instructed the Goldman Sachs representatives to inform the J.P. Morgan representatives of the Special\nCommittee\u2019s determination.\nFollowing the Special Committee\u2019s meeting on October 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs communicated\nto representatives of J.P. Morgan that the Special Committee determined that Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal\nsignificantly undervalued Myovant and was not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs also informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that the Special Committee had\ndetermined not to engage with Sumitovant on its further due diligence or negotiation of the draft Merger Agreement.\nOn October 2, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on their interactions with\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan, noting that J.P. Morgan had not provided any revised proposal from Sumitovant and\nSMP and that Sumitovant and SMP expected to issue a press release later that day to the effect that they had\nsubmitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant\nfor $22.75 per share in cash. The Special Committee, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden,\ndiscussed Myovant\u2019s communications plan in response to Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s expected press release and\nauthorized Myovant\u2019s management to issue a press release as discussed at the meeting. The Special Committee\ndiscussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden the possibility of conducting outreach to potential\nthird parties other than Sumitovant after public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal to determine if\nany third parties had interest in a potential transaction with Myovant, and following discussion, the Special\nCommittee determined not to do so at that time, noting the considerations regarding third party outreach discussed at\nthe August 22 meeting of the Special Committee and the fact that the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s and\nSMP\u2019s proposal would put any potential bidders on notice of the opportunity to come forward with a proposal if they\nwere interested.\nOn October 2, 2022, Sumitovant and SMP issued a press release disclosing that it had made a proposal on\nSeptember 30, 2022 to acquire Myovant\u2019s outstanding common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $22.75\nper share in cash. Myovant also issued a press release announcing the receipt of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal\nand the Special Committee\u2019s unanimous determination that such proposal significantly undervalued Myovant and,\ntherefore, was not in the best interests of Myovant or its shareholders.\nOn October 3, 2022, Sumitovant filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D with the SEC, disclosing that it had\nmade a proposal on September 30, 2022 to acquire Myovant\u2019s outstanding common shares not already owned by\nSumitovant for $22.75 per share in cash and attaching a copy of the proposal letter.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs\nprovided an update on the trading in Myovant\u2019s common shares following the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s\nand SMP\u2019s proposal and discussed certain potential next steps with respect to Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal.\nOn October 4, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs\nprovided an update on the trading in Myovant\u2019s common shares following the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s\nand SMP\u2019s proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed certain investor communications that had\noccurred since October 3. The Special Committee discussed with its advisors potential next steps with respect to\nSumitovant and SMP under different scenarios.\nOn October 5, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of a third party (\u201cCompany A\u201d), a\nlarge pharmaceutical company, discussed the public announcement and Company A informed Goldman Sachs that it\nwas evaluating a possible transaction with Myovant.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on October 5, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the request of Sumitovant and SMP, contacted\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs to inquire whether, if Sumitovant and SMP were able to confirm that they would be\nwilling to make a proposal at least at or near recent trading prices of Myovant\u2019s common shares (which closed at\n$25.48 per share on October 4, 2022), it would be possible for the parties to proceed with further due diligence and\nnegotiation of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents. Representatives of J.P. Morgan indicated\nthat once due diligence and merger agreement negotiations were substantially complete, Sumitovant and SMP would\nexpect to be in a position, subject to receipt of internal governance approvals and the results of due diligence, to\nmake an improved proposal for a possible transaction that they would be prepared to negotiate to reach a final\nagreement that could be supported by the Special Committee. Representatives of Goldman Sachs noted to\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan that they would report this discussion to the Special Committee, but that any\nwillingness to provide further due diligence and commence merger agreement negotiations should not be interpreted\nto mean that the price indicated by J.P. Morgan would be acceptable to the Special Committee.\nFollowing the discussion between representatives of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs on October 5, 2022, the\nSpecial Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in\nattendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reported on a call they had with representatives of Company A,\nnoting that Company A was evaluating a potential transaction with Myovant, but that Company A did not believe it\nlikely that it would propose a transaction given that Sumitovant and SMP had publicly stated that Sumitovant was\nnot willing to sell its Myovant shares and would not support an alternative merger, consolidation or similar\ntransaction with a third party involving Myovant. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also reported on discussions\nwith representatives of J.P. Morgan, noting Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal to move forward with their further due\ndiligence and commence negotiations of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents if Sumitovant and\nSMP would confirm their willingness to make an improved proposal at or near recent trading prices of Myovant\u2019s\ncommon shares. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined to permit Sumitovant and SMP to continue\ndue diligence and commence merger agreement negotiations, subject to Sumitovant and SMP confirming their\nunderstanding that they would need to increase their proposed price significantly beyond the current trading price in\norder to obtain the Special Committee\u2019s ultimate support of any transaction. The Special Committee authorized\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs to convey to representatives of J.P. Morgan, for negotiation purposes, that\nSumitovant should be looking to provide value near $30.00 per share, which representatives of Goldman Sachs did\nlater that day.\nOn October 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan confirmed to representatives of Goldman Sachs that\nSumitovant and SMP acknowledged Myovant\u2019s desired value improvement in accordance with the Special\nCommittee\u2019s condition to providing additional due diligence and commencing merger agreement negotiations and\nthat Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s ability to provide such desired value improvement for a transaction would depend on\nthe outcome of its due diligence findings.\nOn October 7, 2022, representatives of Myovant began providing additional responses to Sumitovant\u2019s due\ndiligence requests.\nAlso on October 7, 2022, Skadden sent a revised draft Merger Agreement and an initial draft Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement to Sullivan & Cromwell.\nOn October 11, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell sent Skadden revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the\nSumitovant Voting Agreement.\nAlso on October 11, 2022, Company A informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that after carefully\nconsidering the opportunity for a potential transaction with Myovant and discussing the opportunity internally,\nCompany A had determined that it would not submit a proposal for a transaction with Myovant. Thereafter,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs informed the Chairman of the Special Committee of this fact.\nBetween October 12, 2022 and October 19, 2022, representatives of Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell had\nvarious calls and discussed potential revisions to the drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement, and exchanged drafts of each document, resolving a number of issues related to the conditions to\nClosing, Myovant\u2019s representations and warranties and interim operating covenants, the provisions related to the\nSpecial Committee\u2019s ability to consider alternative proposals, and Sumitovant\u2019s required efforts to obtain any\nnecessary approvals.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 17, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with Mr. Marek and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the request of the Special Committee, Mr. Marek\ndiscussed the need for employee retention to ensure business continuity during the period between signing and\nclosing of a transaction and reviewed management\u2019s proposal for employee retention in connection with any possible\ntransaction with Sumitovant and SMP if recommended by the Special Committee. At the request of the Special\nCommittee, Mr. Marek exited the meeting, and representatives of Skadden reviewed key business and legal issues in\nthe latest draft of the Merger Agreement provided by Sullivan & Cromwell in connection with Sumitovant\u2019s and\nSMP\u2019s proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the Special Committee that Company A had\ndetermined not to submit a proposal for a transaction with Myovant.\nOn October 19, 2022, the Myovant Board held a meeting by videoconference, during which the directors\ndiscussed, among other things, not making the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options pursuant to the\nNon-Executive Director Compensation Plan to non-executive directors that were scheduled to be made on October 21,\n2022 in light of the ongoing discussions between Myovant and Sumitovant. The Myovant Board discussed that\nsuch stock option grant could be replaced by a restricted stock unit grant with equivalent value to be determined at a\nlater Myovant Board meeting (which could be valued at the transaction price if a transaction were recommended by\nthe Special Committee and approved by the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors)). Following the\nMyovant Board meeting, the Compensation Committee resolved that the regular and automatic annual grant of stock\noptions pursuant to the Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan to such non-executive directors would not be\nmade on October 21, 2022.\nOn October 19, 2022, Ms. Potter, Mr. Guinan and representatives of Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell had a call\nto discuss most of the remaining open issues, apart from the price per share payable as merger consideration, with\nrespect to the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including, among other things, regarding (i)\ncertain compensation and benefits matters, including with respect to employee retention and severance protections,\n(ii) post-Closing employee compensation and benefits matters, and (iii) the amount of the termination fee payable in\nthe event of certain terminations of the Merger Agreement. The amount of the price per share payable in the Merger\nand the size of the proposed termination fee remained unresolved following the call.\nFollowing the call on October 19, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and\nthe Sumitovant Voting Agreement to Skadden. Between October 19, 2022 and October 23, 2022, Skadden and Sullivan\n& Cromwell exchanged drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and finalized the terms\nof such agreements.\nOn October 20, 2022, the board of directors of SMP (the \u201cSMP Board\u201d) held a meeting by videoconference, with\nrepresentatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and J.P. Morgan in attendance. During such meeting, the SMP Board (i)\nreviewed the terms of the draft Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, as well as Sumitovant\u2019s\ndiligence findings regarding Myovant, (ii) conditionally approved the delivery of a subsequent offer to Myovant of\nup to a per share price of $27.00 and (iii) approved the entry into the Merger Agreement by Sumitovant and SMP,\nsubject to final approval by the board of directors of Sumitovant (the \u201cSumitovant Board\u201d).\nOn October 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to convey a\nrevised oral proposal from Sumitovant and SMP to acquire the outstanding Myovant common shares not already\nowned by Sumitovant for $25.25 per share in cash, which represented a $2.50 per share increase from Sumitovant\u2019s\nand SMP\u2019s initial offer price of $22.75, and reflected a 40.6% premium to Myovant\u2019s closing price per share prior to\nthe public disclosure of the initial proposed offer (the \u201cUndisturbed Stock Price\u201d).\nOn the morning of October 21, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an\nupdate on discussions with representatives of J.P. Morgan, noting that representatives of J.P. Morgan had\ncommunicated, on behalf of Sumitovant and SMP, an increased proposal of $25.25 per share to acquire the\noutstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by Sumitovant. At the request of the Special Committee, Mr.\nMarek joined the meeting and provided management\u2019s perspectives on the proposal and then exited the meeting. The\nSpecial Committee discussed Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s proposal and the financial analyses previously presented to\nthe Special Committee and authorized Goldman Sachs to respond to J.P. Morgan indicating that the Special Committee\nwas unwilling to accept Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s offer of $25.25 per share\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand that Sumitovant and SMP would need to significantly increase their offer price for the Special Committee to\nsupport a transaction. Following the Special Committee\u2019s meeting on October 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman\nSachs communicated the Special Committee\u2019s message to representatives of J.P. Morgan.\nLater on October 21, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs by\ntelephone to convey a revised proposal from Sumitovant and SMP to acquire the outstanding Myovant common\nshares not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.25 per share in cash, which represented a $1.00 per share increase\nfrom the $25.25 per share proposal made by Sumitovant and SMP earlier that day, and reflected a 46.2% premium to\nthe Undisturbed Stock Price. The J.P. Morgan representatives indicated that this price reflected Sumitovant\u2019s and\nSMP\u2019s views of Myovant\u2019s fundamental value and that Sumitovant and SMP had limited ability to increase their\nproposal from that price.\nFollowing receipt of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s updated proposal on October 21, 2022, the Special Committee met\nagain by videoconference, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs informed the Special Committee of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s latest proposal to acquire the\noutstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.25 per share, and that representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan indicated that Sumitovant and SMP had limited ability to increase their offer price above $26.25 per share.\nThe Special Committee then discussed, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, Sumitovant\u2019s\nand SMP\u2019s revised proposal in the context of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses and the underlying assumptions. At\nthe request of the Special Committee, Mr. Marek joined the meeting to provide management\u2019s perspectives on the\nproposal, following which he exited the meeting. Following discussion, the Special Committee, for purposes of\nnegotiation, authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to inform representatives of J.P. Morgan, among other\nthings, of the request for a higher offer price approaching $30.00 per share and that further negotiation of price, if any,\nshould be communicated between Mr. Guinan and Ms. Potter directly. Shortly after the Special Committee meeting,\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs relayed this message as instructed by the Special Committee to representatives of\nJ.P. Morgan.\nAlso on October 21, 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell provided to Skadden a version of SMP\u2019s facility commitment\nletter, dated as of October 21, 2022 (the \u201cFacility Commitment Letter\u201d), with terms relating to the aggregate\ncommitment amount, interest rates and mandatory prepayment redacted.\nOn October 22, 2022, Ms. Potter called Mr. Guinan and conveyed a further updated proposal to acquire the\noutstanding Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant for $26.75 per share in cash, which\nrepresented a $0.50 per share increase from the $26.25 per share proposal made by Sumitovant and SMP on the\nprevious day. Mr. Guinan indicated that he did not believe that the Special Committee would be supportive of a\ntransaction at that price, to which Ms. Potter indicated that $27.00 per share was the best and final price she was able\nto offer.\nAlso on October 22, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Guinan informed the Special Committee of\nSumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s latest proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of Myovant not already owned by\nSumitovant for $26.75 per share. Mr. Guinan also informed the Special Committee that Ms. Potter indicated that $27.00\nwas the highest price Sumitovant and SMP would propose, which represented a 50.3% premium to the Undisturbed\nStock Price. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its financial analyses. Following discussion, the Special\nCommittee, for purposes of negotiation, determined to request a purchase price of $28.50 per share and authorized\nMr. Guinan to convey to Ms. Potter the Special Committee\u2019s counter-proposal of at least $28.50 per share.\nLater on October 22, 2022, Mr. Guinan called Ms. Potter and conveyed the Special Committee\u2019s counter-proposal\nthat Sumitovant and SMP increase their offer to at least $28.50 per share. Ms. Potter indicated that she did not have\nauthorization to offer above $27.00 per share, but would communicate the Special Committee\u2019s request for at least\n$28.50 per share to Sumitovant and SMP.\nLater in the evening on October 22, 2022, Ms. Potter called Mr. Guinan to inform him that $27.00 per share was\nSumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s best and final offer and that the transaction would not move forward if the Special\nCommittee required a higher price than $27.00 per share. Mr. Guinan noted that he would report that to the Special\nCommittee and would speak with Ms. Potter the following morning.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn the morning of October 23, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting by videoconference, with\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Skadden in attendance. Mr. Guinan updated the Special Committee on his\ndiscussion with Ms. Potter, noting that Ms. Potter informed Mr. Guinan that $27.00 per share was Sumitovant\u2019s and\nSMP\u2019s best and final offer and that the transaction would not move forward if the Special Committee requested a\nhigher price than $27.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its financial analyses of the $27.00 per\nshare proposal. At the request of the Special Committee, Messrs. Marek and Mehra joined the meeting and reviewed\nan update on projected fiscal year 2022 ORGOVYX\u00ae revenues based on year-to-date results that was previously\nreviewed by management with the Myovant Board at its September 15 board meeting and responded to questions\nfrom the Special Committee members, following which they exited the meeting. The Special Committee, together with\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, discussed the possible impact of the updated ORGOVYX\u00ae performance on future\nyears\u2019 sales, and representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed a sensitivity analysis regarding the potential impact on\nvaluation of the ORGOVYX\u00ae update and the potential impact on Myovant\u2019s overall projections. Following\ndiscussion, and taking into account, among other things, the indication that $27.00 per share was Sumitovant\u2019s and\nSMP\u2019s best and final offer and the financial analyses reviewed by Goldman Sachs, the Special Committee determined\nthat it would be supportive of Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s latest proposal of $27.00 per share, and authorized Mr. Guinan\nto convey this message to Ms. Potter.\nFollowing the Special Committee meeting on October 23, 2022, Mr. Guinan contacted Ms. Potter and informed\nher that the Special Committee would support Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s latest proposal of $27.00 per share.

Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed their financial analyses of the proposed transaction. The Special\nCommittee members, with the assistance of Goldman Sachs and Skadden, discussed Sumitovant\u2019s and SMP\u2019s latest\nproposal and the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered to\nthe Special Committee an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 23, 2022,\nto the effect that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications,\nlimitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the $27.00 per share cash merger consideration that\nwould be paid to the holders of Myovant common shares (other than Sumitovant and its affiliates) in the proposed\ntransaction was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. Following discussion, the Special Committee\nunanimously (i) determined that the per share merger consideration constitutes fair value for each common share in\naccordance with the Bermuda Companies Act\u037e (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory\nMerger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory\nMerger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant and its\nshareholders (including \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act)\u037e and\n(iii) recommended that the Myovant Board (a) declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the\nMerger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, (b) adopt the Merger\nAgreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and (c) subject to\nthe right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and the Special\nCommittee to change their recommendations in certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, recommend\nthat Myovant\u2019s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory\nMerger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory\nMerger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant\u2019s shareholders for\nsuch purpose.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Special Committee meeting on October 23, 2022, the Myovant Board held a\nmeeting by videoconference, with Mr. Lang and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Skadden and Conyers in\nattendance.

The Special Committee members believe that the per share merger\nconsideration represents compelling and fair value for Myovant common shares based on the Special\nCommittee\u2019s overall knowledge and understanding, and information obtained by the Special Committee\n(including from Myovant management and the Special Committee\u2019s independent financial advisor),\nregarding Myovant\u2019s business, operations, assets and liabilities, current, historical and prospective\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, strategy and competitive position, as well as industry\ntrends, long-term strategic goals and opportunities, including the potential impact of those factors on the\ntrading price of Myovant common shares (which cannot be quantified numerically).\n\u2022\nPremium to Market Price. The Special Committee considered the current and historical trading prices of\nMyovant common shares, including the relationship of the $27.00 per share merger consideration to the\nrecent and historical trading prices of Myovant common shares, including that the per share merger\nconsideration represents:\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30,\n2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding\nproposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on\nwhich date the closing price was $17.96)\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 48.4% to the 30-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through\nSeptember 30, 2022 (which was $18.19)\u037e and\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 13.1% to the 52-week high trading price per Myovant common share as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 (which was $23.87).\n\u2022\nPer Share Merger Consideration. The Special Committee considered:\n\u2022\nthat the per share merger consideration consists solely of cash, which provides certainty of value and\nimmediate liquidity at Closing to the Minority Shareholders, particularly in light of the relatively limited\ntrading volume of the Myovant common shares, without the long-term business and execution risk\nassociated with Myovant\u2019s long-term plans\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that all of the Minority Shareholders will be entitled to receive the same per share merger\nconsideration.\n\u2022\nSpecial Committee\u2019s Negotiations. The Special Committee considered its extensive negotiations with\nSumitovant, and the fact that, during the course of such negotiations, Sumitovant raised the value of the\nper share merger consideration offered four times, from $22.75, to $25.25, to $26.25, to $26.75 and finally to\n$27.00 (representing a total increase of 18.7%), which Sumitovant indicated was its best and final offer for\nMyovant and which the Special Committee believed, after such negotiations with Sumitovant and its\nrepresentatives, was the highest price per share obtainable from Sumitovant for the outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares not already owned by Sumitovant.\n\u2022\nFinancial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Special Committee considered the financial\nanalyses and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion,\ndated October 23, 2022 (which financial analyses and opinion were adopted by the Special Committee), that,\nas of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and\nassumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority\nShareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as\nmore fully described below in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the\nSpecial Committee\u201d and the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nPotential Benefits of Business Combination. The Special Committee considered that the transaction\nprovides benefits for Myovant in addition to the attractive value to Myovant shareholders, including:\n\u2022\nthe likelihood that the Merger will reduce development and commercialization risk for Myovant by\nallowing Myovant to leverage the resources and expertise of Sumitovant and its affiliates to swiftly\ndrive the development and commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae and MYFEMBREE\u00ae\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Merger represents an opportunity to combine the expertise, platforms and resources of both\nMyovant and Sumitovant to address unmet needs in women\u2019s health and prostate cancer\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe potential risks associated with remaining as a separate public company with a majority shareholder\nand possible alternative business strategies instead of consummating the Merger.\n\u2022\nLow Likelihood of Alternative Transactions. The Special Committee considered:\n\u2022\nthe fact that Sumitovant owns a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares, and\ncommunicated to the Special Committee in its publicly filed, initial non-binding proposal letter\ndelivered on September 30, 2022 that Sumitovant, in its capacity as a majority shareholder of Myovant,\nis interested only in acquiring Myovant common shares not already owned by Sumitovant and that in\nsuch capacity, Sumitovant has no interest in selling any Myovant common shares it owns, nor would\nSumitovant support any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving Myovant, which\ncould discourage the making of a competing acquisition proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe absence of other strategic alternatives available to Myovant that would provide comparable or\nsuperior value to Myovant shareholders, based in part on the Special Committee\u2019s determination,\nfollowing consultation with its independent financial advisor and taking into account the fact that\nSumitovant\u2019s proposal had been publicly announced and that thereafter no third party had submitted\na proposal to acquire Myovant prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (including the fact that\nCompany A, after considering the opportunity for a transaction with Myovant and discussing it with\nthe Special Committee\u2019s independent financial advisor, had determined to not submit a proposal for a\ntransaction with Myovant).\n\u2022\nTiming Considerations. The Special Committee considered:\n\u2022\nthe timing of the Merger and the risk that if Myovant does not accept Sumitovant\u2019s offer now, it may\nnot have another opportunity to do so or to pursue an opportunity offering the same or better value\nand certainty to Myovant\u2019s shareholders in the future\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact that the standstill restrictions that apply to Sumitovant pursuant to the Investor Rights\nAgreement would expire on December 27, 2022, and that, following such expiration, Sumitovant could\nacquire the remaining Myovant common shares it does not already own with only the requisite\nshareholder approvals and without the approval of the independent directors serving on the Audit\nCommittee, which could decrease Myovant\u2019s negotiating power and could result in the consideration\nand/or terms of such transaction being less favorable to Myovant and its shareholders than the per\nshare merger consideration and the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nCertainty of Closing. The Special Committee took into account its belief that the Merger has a high\nlikelihood of being completed in a timely manner based on, among other things, (i) the reputation,\nacquisition experience and financial resources of Sumitovant and its ability to complete an acquisition\ntransaction involving the Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, (ii) the limited\nnumber and nature of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the fact that there is no\nfinancing condition, (iii) Sumitovant entering into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and (iv) Myovant\u2019s\nability, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to pursue remedies that include specific performance and\nequitable relief to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement by Sumitovant and to specifically enforce the\nterms of the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nTerms of the Transaction Documents. The Special Committee considered the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and other transaction documents, including the review by the Special Committee with its\nindependent financial advisor and legal counsel of, and advice received from such advisor and counsel on,\nthe structure of the contemplated transactions and financial and other terms of the Merger\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAgreement and the other agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, including with respect to\ndeal protection, conditionality, termination rights and the likelihood of consummating the Merger\n(including with respect to obtaining required shareholder approvals and required HSR approval).\n\u2022\nAbility to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Alternative Proposals. The Special Committee considered\nthat the Merger Agreement gives the Special Committee the right to respond to, furnish information\nand negotiate with respect to unsolicited alternative proposals from third parties in certain\ncircumstances described in the Merger Agreement and to change its recommendation to Myovant\u2019s\nshareholders to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement if a superior\nproposal is available or in response to an intervening event (as defined in the section below entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-No Solicitation\u037e No Change in Myovant Recommendation\u201d).\n\u2022\nMyovant Termination Rights. The Special Committee considered that Myovant would be permitted,\nunder certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement\nin order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal after giving Sumitovant the\nopportunity to match the superior proposal and upon payment of the termination fee equal to\n$55,250,000 (which is approximately 1.9% of the total equity value of Myovant at the transaction\nprice).\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The Special Committee believes that the termination fee of $55,250,000 that could\nbecome payable by Myovant pursuant to the Merger Agreement in the event the Merger Agreement\nis terminated under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement is reasonable and would\nnot likely deter third parties from making alternative acquisition proposals that would be more\nfavorable to Myovant\u2019s shareholders than the Merger.\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Special Committee considered the fact that Sumitovant has financing in\nplace to fund the aggregate per share merger consideration and any transaction expenses, that SMP\nhas irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual payment obligations of Sumitovant and Merger Sub\nunder the Merger Agreement and that Sumitovant\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations to complete the\nMerger and pay the aggregate per share merger consideration are not conditioned on Sumitovant or\nMerger Sub obtaining financing.\n\u2022\nSumitovant Voting Agreement. The Special Committee considered the fact that Sumitovant entered\ninto the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Sumitovant has agreed, among other\nthings, to vote or cause to be voted all of the Myovant common shares that it or its affiliates (other\nthan Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of the Merger Proposal and all of the\nother proposals presented at the special general meeting.\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The Special Committee considered the availability of appraisal rights to shareholders of\nMyovant who do not vote in favor of the Merger, which rights provide eligible shareholders with the\nopportunity to have Bermuda courts determine the fair value of their shares.\n\u2022\nEmployee Considerations. The Special Committee believes that treatment of equity awards held by\nmanagement and employees, the treatment of the transaction as a \u201cChange in Control\u201d under Myovant\u2019s\nseverance arrangements and the ability to adopt an employee retention plan approved by the Special\nCommittee will reduce the risk of attrition of key employees during the pre-Closing period, which will help\nensure continuity of Myovant\u2019s business during the period prior to closing under the Merger Agreement\n(thereby reducing risk of non-consummation), and could reduce the risk to Myovant if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated.\n\u2022\nProcedural Safeguards. The Special Committee considered the following procedural safeguards\nimplemented in an effort to ensure the fairness of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement and to permit\nthe Special Committee to represent the interests of the Minority Shareholders:\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee consists solely of directors of Myovant who are independent directors not\naffiliated with Sumitovant and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and who are\nindependent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement,\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand the Special Committee was advised by an independent legal counsel and an independent financial\nadvisor in its review, evaluation and negotiation of the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe resolutions of the Myovant Board forming the Special Committee and authorizing the Special\nCommittee to oversee matters relating to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and any alternatives\nthereto, including, without limitation, (i) evaluating any proposal from Sumitovant with respect to a\npotential transaction and any alternatives thereto in order to make a recommendation to the Myovant\nBoard as to whether Myovant should seek into engage in the potential transaction with Sumitovant\nand (ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in the potential transaction, developing,\nassessing and negotiating the terms of the potential transaction with Sumitovant and making a\nrecommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential\ntransaction, and the fact that the Myovant Board was not permitted to approve any transaction with\nSumitovant unless recommended by the Special Committee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, including the standstill restrictions, which provide\nadditional protections to the Minority Shareholders in connection with any business combination\ntransaction between Myovant and Sumitovant, including the requirement that any such business\ncombination transaction be approved by the independent directors serving on the Audit Committee\nand by a majority of Myovant\u2019s outstanding voting shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe fact that Sumitovant\u2019s proposal was conditioned on approval by the three independent directors\nserving on the Audit Committee and the approval of Myovant\u2019s shareholders holding a majority of the\noutstanding Myovant common shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates.\nIn the course of reaching its determinations and making its recommendations, the Special Committee also\nconsidered the following countervailing factors concerning the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement\nand the Merger:\n\u2022\nGeneral Transaction Risks. The Special Committee considered the risks involved with the Merger,\nincluding the risk that the Merger may not be completed because one or more of the conditions to Closing\n(including HSR clearance) would not be satisfied, and the effect that failing to complete the Merger may\nhave on the business, financial results and share price of Myovant, or on the perceptions of Myovant\namong investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders.\n\u2022\nNo Shareholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Special Committee considered the fact\nthat Myovant will no longer exist as a separate public company and Myovant\u2019s shareholders will forego\nany potential future increase in its value as a separate public company that might result from its possible\ngrowth and future prospects.\n\u2022\nImpact of Announcement on Myovant. The Special Committee considered the possible negative effects of\nthe Merger and public announcement of the Merger on Myovant\u2019s business, financial performance,\noperating results and share price and Myovant\u2019s relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors,\ncommercial partners, management and employees.\n\u2022\nNo Solicitation. The Special Committee considered the fact that the Merger Agreement (i) precludes\nMyovant from actively soliciting competing acquisition proposals (as described in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-No Solicitation\u037e No Change in Myovant Recommendation\u201d) and (ii) obligates\nMyovant (or its successor) to pay Sumitovant the termination fee of $55,250,000 in connection with a\ntermination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, which could discourage the making of a\ncompeting acquisition proposal or adversely impact the price offered in such a proposal.\n\u2022\nPre-Closing Covenants. The Special Committee considered the fact that the Merger Agreement imposes\nrestrictions on the conduct of Myovant\u2019s business in the pre-Closing period, which may adversely affect\nMyovant\u2019s business in the event the Merger is not completed (including by delaying or preventing\nMyovant from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or precluding actions that would be\nadvisable if Myovant were to remain a separate public company).\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nManagement Attention. The Special Committee considered the risk that the contemplated transactions may\ndivert management focus and resources from operating Myovant\u2019s business, as well as other strategic\nopportunities.\n\u2022\nExpenses. The Special Committee considered the substantial transaction expenses to be incurred in\nconnection with the Merger (including that Myovant may become obligated to pay Sumitovant a\ntermination fee of $55,250,000 in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain\ncircumstances specified in the Merger Agreement) and the negative impact of such expenses on\nMyovant\u2019s cash reserves and operating results should the Merger not be completed.\n\u2022\nTax Consequences. The Special Committee considered the fact that the per share merger consideration\nconsists solely of cash and will therefore be taxable to Myovant shareholders who are subject to taxation\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nLitigation. The Special Committee considered the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that\ncould be instituted against Myovant and/or its directors and officers, and the potential effects of any\noutcomes related thereto, including potential management distraction and expenses that could result from\nsuch litigation.\n\u2022\nDirector and Officer Interests. The Special Committee considered the fact that Myovant\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be deemed to be different from, or in addition\nto, those of Myovant\u2019s other shareholders generally, as described in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-\nInterests of Myovant\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe Special Committee did not specifically consider the liquidation value or the net book value of Myovant in\nits evaluation of the Merger because of its belief that neither liquidation value nor net book value presents a\nmeaningful valuation for Myovant and its business, as Myovant\u2019s value is derived from the cash flows anticipated to\nbe generated from its continuing operations, including revenues Myovant is projected to realize from the\ncommercialization of its drug products and candidates, rather than from the value of assets that might be realized in a\nliquidation or from net book value which is significantly influenced by historical costs. Further, the Special Committee\ndid not consider liquidation value in evaluating the Merger because of its belief that Myovant remains a viable going\nconcern and that any prospective acquirer of Myovant, including Sumitovant, would continue to operate Myovant\nas a going concern following the consummation of such transaction. Neither the Special Committee nor Goldman\nSachs conducted a separate going-concern valuation of Myovant because the financial analyses presented by\nGoldman Sachs, as more fully described in the sections titled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the\nSpecial Committee,\u201d contained financial analyses of the cash flows anticipated to be generated by Myovant\u2019s\ncontinuing operations as a going concern, as reflected in the Revised Projections, and the Special Committee\nbelieved these analyses to be appropriate to illustrate the value of Myovant as a going concern. The Special\nCommittee considered the purchase prices of Myovant common shares paid in previous purchases of Myovant\ncommon shares as described under \u201cTransactions in Common Shares-Transactions in Common Shares by the\nPurchaser Filing Persons During the Past Two Years.\u201d The then-current market price of Myovant common shares on\nSeptember 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding\nproposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on which date the\nclosing price was $17.96), as well as the majority of the historical market closing prices of Myovant common shares in\nthe last two years, were lower than the per share merger consideration. The Special Committee therefore considered\nthese to be positive factors and potential benefits of the Merger. Myovant is not aware of any firm offers made by\nany unaffiliated person, other than the Purchaser Filing Persons, during the past two years for (i) the merger or\nconsolidation of Myovant with or into another company, or vice versa\u037e (ii) the sale or other transfer of all or any\nsubstantial part of the assets of Myovant\u037e or (iii) a purchase of Myovant\u2019s securities that would enable the holder to\nexercise control of Myovant.\nThe Special Committee notes that the opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs addresses the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the Minority Shareholders, including the director and officer shareholders of Myovant who\nare affiliates of Myovant. These director and officer shareholders are treated in the same way with respect to their\nMyovant common shares as the unaffiliated security holders in connection with the Merger, and such director and\nofficer shareholders will receive the same per share merger consideration for their Myovant common shares as the\nunaffiliated security holders. In addition, the Goldman Sachs opinion expressly states that Goldman\n \n39\n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSachs did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any other compensation to be paid or\npayable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Myovant, or class of such persons, in connection with the\nMerger, whether relative to the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders\npursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Therefore, the Special Committee believes there is no material\ndistinction between the fairness of the Merger to the unaffiliated security holders and the Minority Shareholders and\ndoes not believe the inclusion of these director and officer shareholders as being encompassed in the universe of\nMinority Shareholders affects the Special Committee\u2019s ability to rely on the opinion of Goldman Sachs as one of the\nmany factors on which the Special Committee determined that the Merger is fair to the unaffiliated security holders.\nAfter taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Special Committee concluded\nthat the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed\nby the potential benefits of the Merger to Myovant\u2019s shareholders.\nThe above discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee is not intended to be\nexhaustive, but indicates the material matters considered. In reaching its determination and recommendation, the\nSpecial Committee did not quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weight to any of the foregoing factors, and\nindividual members of the Special Committee may have considered various factors differently. The Special Committee\ndid not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any specific factor, or any particular aspect of any\nfactor, supported or did not support its ultimate recommendation. Moreover, in considering the information and\nfactors described above, individual members of the Special Committee may have given differing weights to differing\nfactors. The Special Committee based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.\nThe Myovant Board\nAt a meeting held on October 23, 2022, the Myovant Board (which for purposes of this section means other than\nthe Sumitomo Directors, who waived notice of, and recused themselves from, the Myovant Board meeting, and\nabstained from voting on matters relating to the proposed transaction with Myovant), acting upon the unanimous\nrecommendation of the Special Committee, adopted resolutions by vote of its members (i) determining that the per\nshare merger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share in accordance with the Bermuda\nCompanies Act, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the\nMerger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the\nSumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant and its shareholders (including\n\u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act), (iii) declaring advisable the\nexecution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant\nVoting Agreement, (iv) adopting the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and approving the\nMerger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the\nSumitovant Voting Agreement, and (v) subject to the right of the Myovant Board (acting upon the recommendation\nof the Special Committee) and the Special Committee to change their recommendations in certain circumstances\nspecified in the Merger Agreement, recommending that Myovant\u2019s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and\napproval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a\nduly held meeting of Myovant\u2019s shareholders for such purpose.\nThe Myovant Board considered and relied upon the analyses and the unanimous recommendation of the\nSpecial Committee (which analyses and unanimous recommendation were adopted by the Myovant Board) as set\nforth in the section above entitled \u201c-The Special Committee\u201d in arriving at this determination and recommendation. In\nconsidering the Special Committee\u2019s analyses and recommendation, the Myovant Board reviewed and discussed\ninformation with respect to Myovant\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, businesses, competitive position\nand business strategy, on a historical and prospective basis, as well as current industry, economic and market\nconditions and trends, and discussed the Special Committee\u2019s recommendation\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith the members of the Special Committee and the independent financial advisor and legal counsel of the Special\nCommittee. The following are the material factors that supported the Myovant Board\u2019s determination and\nrecommendation, in addition to the factors set forth in the section above entitled \u201c-The Special Committee\u201d:\n\u2022\nSpecial Committee Recommendation. The Myovant Board considered and relied upon the analyses and\nthe unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee (which analyses and unanimous recommendation\nwere adopted by the Myovant Board) as set forth in the section above entitled \u201c-The Special Committee.\u201d\n\u2022\nProcedural Safeguards. The Myovant Board considered the following procedural safeguards implemented\nin an effort to ensure the fairness of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement to permit the Special\nCommittee to represent the interests of the Minority Shareholders:\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee consists solely of directors of Myovant who are independent directors not\naffiliated with Sumitovant and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and who are\nindependent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and\nthe Special Committee was advised by an independent legal counsel and an independent financial\nadvisor in its review, evaluation and negotiation of the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe resolutions of the Myovant Board forming the Special Committee and authorizing the Special\nCommittee to oversee matters relating to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and any alternatives\nthereto, including, without limitation, (i) evaluating any proposal from Sumitovant with respect to a\npotential transaction and any alternatives thereto in order to make a recommendation to the Myovant\nBoard as to whether Myovant should seek into engage in the potential transaction with Sumitovant\nand (ii) if determined that Myovant should seek to engage in the potential transaction, developing,\nassessing and negotiating the terms of the potential transaction with Sumitovant and making a\nrecommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential\ntransaction, and the fact that the Myovant Board was not permitted to approve any transaction with\nSumitovant unless recommended by the Special Committee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, including the standstill restrictions, which provide\nadditional protections to the Minority Shareholders in connection with any business combination\ntransaction between Myovant and Sumitovant, including the requirement that any such business\ncombination transaction be approved by the independent directors serving on the Audit Committee\nand by a majority of Myovant\u2019s outstanding voting shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe fact that Sumitovant\u2019s proposal was conditioned on approval by the independent directors\nserving on the Audit Committee and the approval of Myovant\u2019s shareholders holding a majority of the\noutstanding Myovant common shares not owned by Sumitovant or its affiliates.\n\u2022\nSpecial Committee\u2019s Negotiations. The Myovant Board considered the Special Committee\u2019s negotiations\nwith Sumitovant, and the fact that, during the course of such negotiations, Sumitovant raised the value of\nthe per share merger consideration offered four times, from $22.75, to $25.25, to $26.25, to $26.75 and finally\nto $27.00 (representing a total increase of 18.7%), which Sumitovant indicated was its best and final offer\nfor Myovant and which the Myovant Board believed, after such negotiations with Sumitovant and its\nrepresentatives, was the highest price per share obtainable from Sumitovant for the outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares not already owned by Sumitovant.\n\u2022\nSpecial Committee\u2019s Process. The Myovant Board considered the fact that the Special Committee held 19\nmeetings with its independent financial advisor and legal counsel to discuss and evaluate the\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntransaction with Sumitovant, other alternatives to the transaction and other matters related thereto and was\nadvised by a nationally recognized independent financial advisor and a nationally recognized independent\nlegal counsel, and that each member of the Special Committee was actively engaged in the process on a\ncontinuous and regular basis.\n\u2022\nFinancial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs. The Myovant Board considered the financial\nanalyses and the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs as delivered to the Special Committee, subsequently\nconfirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated October 23, 2022 (which financial analyses and opinion\nwere adopted by the Special Committee), that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject\nto the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger\nconsideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled \u201cSpecial\nFactors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee\u201d and the full text of the opinion, which is\nattached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nIn considering the recommendations of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the\nunanimous recommendation of the Special Committee), Myovant\u2019s shareholders should be aware that Myovant\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers may have interests with respect to the contemplated transactions that may be in\naddition to, or that may be different from, the interests of the Minority Shareholders generally, as described in the\nsection entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Interests of Myovant\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d The\nmembers of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board were aware of these interests and considered them,\namong others, in reaching their determinations to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement\nand approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger\nAgreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, and to make their recommendations to the Myovant Board and\nMyovant\u2019s shareholders, as applicable.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOpinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Special Committee that, as of October 23, 2022, and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid\nto the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2022, which sets forth assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the\nopinion, is attached as Annex C. The summary of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion contained in this proxy statement is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion. Goldman Sachs provided\nadvisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in its consideration of\nthe Merger. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Myovant common shares\nshould vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\n\u2022\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,\nGoldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nAnnual Reports on Form 10-K of Myovant for the five fiscal years ended March 31, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Myovant to its shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Myovant\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Myovant\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Myovant, including assumed probabilities\nassociated with certain future events contemplated by such forecasts, and certain analyses related to\nthe expected utilization by Myovant of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and\ndevelopment credit carryforwards of Myovant, each as prepared by the management of Myovant and\napproved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the Special Committee.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Myovant regarding their\nassessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Myovant\u037e\nreviewed the reported price and trading activity for Myovant common shares\u037e compared certain financial and stock\nmarket information for Myovant with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are\npublicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent minority squeeze out transactions, including in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as\nGoldman Sachs deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Special Committee\u2019s consent, relied upon and\nassumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information\nprovided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent\nverification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Special Committee\u2019s consent that the Revised\nProjections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of\nthe Special Committee. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and\nliabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Myovant or any of\nits subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs\nassumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the\nMerger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to\nits analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the\nMerger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any\nway meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Myovant to engage in the\nMerger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to\nMyovant\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion addresses\nonly the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Minority Shareholders, as of the date of the opinion, of the\n$27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndoes not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the\nMerger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or\nentered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration\nreceived in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nMyovant\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of Myovant, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether\nrelative to the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be paid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and\nother conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman\nSachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,\ndevelopments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any\nopinion as to the prices at which Myovant common shares will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of\nvolatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Myovant, Sumitovant or the Merger, or as to the impact of the\nMerger on the solvency or viability of Myovant or Sumitovant or the ability of Myovant or Sumitovant to pay their\nrespective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of\nGoldman Sachs.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Special\nCommittee in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of\nanalyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together\nwith the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is\nbased on market data as it existed on or before October 21, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement\nof the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nHistorical Stock Trading Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to the holders of\nMyovant common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per Myovant common\nshare on September 30, 2022, the last trading day before public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding\nproposal to acquire Myovant, (ii) the VWAP per Myovant common share for the preceding 30-calendar day period\nended September 30, 2022, and (iii) the high closing price per Myovant common share for the 52-week period ended\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nThis analysis indicated that the price per Myovant common share to be paid to the Minority Shareholders\npursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 50.3% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30, 2022\n(the last trading day prior to the public announcement of Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding proposal to\nacquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own, on which date the\nclosing price was $17.96)\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 48.4% to the 30-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through\nSeptember 30, 2022 (which was $18.19)\u037e and\n\u2022\na premium of approximately 13.1% to the 52-week high trading price per Myovant common share as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 (which was $23.87).\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Revised Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an\nillustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Myovant. Using a mid-year convention and discount rates ranging from\n12.0% to 14.0%, reflecting estimates of Myovant\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d), Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Myovant for the second,\nthird and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 (\u201cfiscal year 2023\u201d) through the\nfiscal year ending March 31, 2037 (\u201cfiscal year 2036\u201d) as reflected in the Revised Projections and (ii) a range of\nillustrative terminal values for Myovant, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from\n(60.0%) to (100.0%) to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by Myovant, as reflected in the\nRevised Projections. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model,\nwhich requires certain company-specific inputs, including Myovant\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlong-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for\nMyovant, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity\ngrowth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account\nthe Revised Projections and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and\ninflation. In addition, using a discount rate of 13.0%, reflecting an estimate of Myovant\u2019s WACC, Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of June 30, 2022 the estimated benefits of Myovant\u2019s net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d)\nfor fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2036, as reflected in the Revised Projections. Goldman Sachs derived a range\nof illustrative enterprise values for Myovant by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above\nand reflecting Myovant\u2019s net cash balance of $0 as of June 30, 2022. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of\nillustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Myovant, as provided by the\nmanagement of Myovant and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the Special Committee, to derive a range of\nillustrative present values per Myovant common share ranging from $25.59 to $30.74.\nPremia Analyses. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition\npremia in acquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2012 through October 21, 2022,\ninvolving a public company in the biopharmaceutical industry as the target in a minority squeeze out transaction\nwhere the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was over $500 million. For the entire period, using publicly\navailable information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median premium of the final price paid in the selected\ntransactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to public announcement of the initial bid\nof the acquirer. This analysis indicated a high, median and low premium, rounded to the nearest tenth, of 102.6%,\n59.5% and 41.1%, respectively, across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of\nillustrative premiums of 41.1% to 102.6% to the undisturbed closing price per Myovant common share of $17.96 as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, and calculated a range of implied equity values per Myovant common share of $25.34 to $36.39.\nThe following table presents the analyzed transactions:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEnterprise Value \n($ in millions)\nFinal\nBid \nper\nShare\n1-Day \nPremium(1)\nNovember 12, 2020\nUrovant Sciences Ltd.\nSumitovant Biopharma Ltd.\n$ 681.0\n$ 16.25\n102.6%\nOctober 5, 2020\nEidos Therapeutics, Inc.\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\n$1,651.6\n$73.26\n41.1%\nAugust 31, 2020\nAkcea Therapeutics, Inc.\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n$ 500.0\n$18.15\n59.5%\n \n(1)\nBased on the undisturbed stock price prior to the transaction announcement\u037e Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. / BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\nfinal offer premia was based on the undisturbed stock price prior to the final offer due to the length of the negotiation process.\nGoldman Sachs also reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia in\nacquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2012 through October 21, 2022, involving\na public company as the target in a minority squeeze out transaction where the disclosed enterprise value for the\ntransaction was over $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated\nthe median premium of the final price paid in the selected transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing\nstock price prior to public announcement of the initial bid of the acquirer. This analysis indicated a high, median and\nlow premium, rounded to the nearest tenth, of 45.3%, 37.4% and 15.2%, respectively, across the period. Using this\nanalysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 15% to 45% to the undisturbed closing\nprice per Myovant common share of $17.96 as of September 30, 2022, and calculated a range of implied equity values\nper Myovant common share of $20.65 to $26.04. The following table presents the analyzed transactions:\nAnnouncement\nDate\nTarget\nAcquiror\nEnterprise Value \n($ in millions)\nFinal\nBid \nper\nShare\n1-Day \nPremium(1)\nOctober 5, 2020\nEidos Therapeutics, Inc.\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\n$ 1,651.6\n$ 73.26\n41.1%\nFebruary 21, 2020\nAVX Corporation\nKyocera Corporation\n$ 1,046.1\n$ 21.75\n44.6%\nMay 22, 2019\nInternational Speedway\nCorporation\nNASCAR Holdings, Inc.\n$ 1,128.4\n$ 45.00\n15.2%\nJune 19, 2018\nFoundation Medicine, Inc.\nRoche Holdings, Inc.\n$ 2,260.9\n$\n137.00\n28.7%\nMarch 1, 2018\nAmTrust Financial \nServices, Inc.\nEvergreen Parent L.P.\n$ 1,327.5\n$ 14.75\n45.3%\nDecember 17, 2012\nClearwire Corporation\nSprint Nextel Corporation\n$ 3,329.8\n$\n2.97\n33.8%\n \n(1)\nBased on the undisturbed stock price prior to the transaction announcement\u037e Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. / BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\nfinal offer premia was based on the undisturbed stock price prior to the final offer due to the length of the negotiation process.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis\nor summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering\nthe analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Myovant,\nSumitovant or the contemplated Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs providing its opinion to the Special\nCommittee as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the $27.00 in cash per share merger consideration to be\npaid to the Minority Shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses\nbased upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject\nto uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective\nadvisors, none of Myovant, Sumitovant, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results\nare materially different from those forecasts.\nThe per share merger consideration was determined through negotiations between Sumitovant and the Special\nCommittee. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did\nnot, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee or that any specific amount\nof consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described in the section above entitled \u201c-Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Special Committee\nand the Myovant Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Special Committee was one of many\nfactors taken into consideration by the Special Committee in making its determination to approve the Merger\nAgreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written\nopinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales\nand trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for\nvarious persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they\nmanage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time\npurchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,\ncurrencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of Myovant, Sumitovant, any of their respective\naffiliates and third parties, including Sumitomo Chemical, the parent company of SMP, and its affiliates or any\ncurrency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman\nSachs acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with, and participated in certain of the\nnegotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting\nservices to Myovant and its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs\nhas received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as Myovant\u2019s financial advisor in connection\nwith the licensing of ORGOVYX\u00ae commercialization rights in certain territories in May 2022. During the two-year\nperiod ended October 23, 2022, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation from Myovant for financial advisory\nand/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Myovant and/or to its affiliates of\napproximately $5 million. During the two-year period ended October 23, 2022, the Investment Banking Division of\nGoldman Sachs has not been engaged by Sumitovant or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting\nservices for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may in the future provide financial\nadvisory and/or underwriting services to Myovant, Sumitovant, SMP and their respective affiliates for which the\nInvestment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.\nThe Special Committee selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally\nrecognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to\na letter agreement dated April 29, 2022, the Special Committee engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor\nin connection with the Merger. The engagement letter among Myovant, the Special Committee and Goldman Sachs\nprovides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof announcement, at approximately $38.9 million, with the possibility of an additional fee, payable at the sole\ndiscretion of the Special Committee, of 0.5% of the aggregate consideration paid, all of which is contingent upon\nconsummation of the Merger. In addition, Myovant has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its\nexpenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against\nvarious liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nOther Written Presentations by Goldman Sachs\nIn addition to the presentation made to the Special Committee on October 23, 2022 described above under \u201c-\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,\u201d Goldman Sachs also made various preliminary presentations to the Special\nCommittee on June 28, 2022, August 3, 2022, August 22, 2022, October 1, 2022, October 21, 2022 and October 22, 2022.\nCopies of the written preliminary presentations and a copy of the presentation made to the Special Committee on\nOctober 23, 2022 have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed\nMerger. These written preliminary presentations and the presentation made to the Special Committee on October 23,\n2022 will be available to any interested shareholder of Myovant (or any representative of a shareholder who has been\nso designated in writing) to inspect and copy at Myovant\u2019s principal executive offices during regular business hours.\nNone of the various preliminary presentations to the Special Committee, alone or together, constitute, or form\nthe basis for, an opinion of Goldman Sachs. Information contained in the various preliminary presentations is\nsubstantially similar to the information provided in Goldman Sachs\u2019 oral and written presentation to the Special\nCommittee on October 23, 2022, as described above under \u201c-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

        "Section Text": "Summary of Presentations Provided by J.P. Morgan\nSumitovant retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with its consideration of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. Sumitovant selected J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor because it is an\ninternationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In this capacity, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided\nSumitovant with certain financial advisory services. Although J.P. Morgan generally acted as financial advisor to\nSumitovant, J.P. Morgan was not requested to provide, and did not provide, to Sumitovant, any other Purchaser\nFiling Person, Myovant, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any Purchaser\nFiling Person or Myovant, or any other person (i) any report, opinion or appraisal as to the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the per share merger\nconsideration or any other term or aspect of any of the foregoing, (ii) any other valuation of any of the Purchaser\nFiling Persons or Myovant for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the per share merger consideration to any\nsuch person or (iii) any advice as to the underlying decision by any Purchaser Filing Person to engage in the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Because J.P. Morgan was not requested to, and did not, deliver\na fairness opinion in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, J.P. Morgan did not\nperform financial analyses with a view towards those analyses supporting a fairness opinion. At various times during\nthe course of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement as financial advisor to Sumitovant, representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed\nwith Sumitovant various considerations with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding what financial analyses would be helpful to Sumitovant, and J.P. Morgan produced various financial\nanalyses during the course of its engagement.\nThe discussion materials prepared by representatives of J.P. Morgan for use in discussions with Sumitovant (the\n\u201cJ.P. Morgan Discussion Materials\u201d) have been filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in\nconnection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Schedule 13E-3, including the J.P.\nMorgan Discussion Materials, may be examined at, and copies may be obtained from, the SEC in the manner\ndescribed under \u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d The information in the J.P. Morgan Discussion\nMaterials is subject to, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and\nlimitations, qualifications and other conditions contained therein and is necessarily based on economic, monetary,\nmarket and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such\nmaterials. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are not intended to be and do not constitute a\n48TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecommendation to any Purchaser Filing Person, Myovant, or any other entity with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other matter. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials do not\nconstitute, and are not intended to represent, any view, opinion, report or appraisal as to the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the per share merger\nconsideration to any Purchaser Filing Person, the Myovant shareholders or any other person.\nBelow is a summary of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, which is qualified in its entirety by the full\ncontents of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. The below summary presents the material analyses conducted by\nJ.P. Morgan and provided to Sumitovant, as well as the material assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations, qualifications and other conditions to the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, but does not\npurport to be a complete description of the financial analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan or the underlying\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations, qualifications and other conditions\ncontained therein, nor does the order of analyses or materials represent relative importance or weight given to those\nanalyses or materials by J.P. Morgan. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials were not appraisals of the business of\nMyovant or the actual value that may be received in connection with the transaction, and did not take into account\nthe potential effects of the transaction. The preparation of financial analyses is a complex analytical process\ninvolving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the\napplication of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, financial analyses are not readily\nsusceptible to summary description. J.P. Morgan considered the results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a\nwhole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis.\nConsidering the summaries set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial\nanalyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying these analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials.\nThe J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials were provided solely for the benefit of Sumitovant for its information and\nassistance in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The J.P.\nMorgan Discussion Materials do not themselves convey rights or remedies upon the holders of any class of\nsecurities, creditors or other constituencies of any Purchaser Filing Person, Myovant or any other person (other than\nSumitovant).\nIn connection with the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials, J.P. Morgan reviewed, among other things, certain\npublicly available historical business and financial information concerning Myovant, certain publicly available\ninformation about select prior going-private merger transactions and certain non-public information regarding the\nbusiness and prospects of Myovant prepared by management of Myovant and approved for J.P. Morgan\u2019s use by\nSumitovant. J.P. Morgan also reviewed certain financial analyses and forecasts concerning Myovant prepared by\nSumitovant and approved for J.P. Morgan\u2019s use by Sumitovant, which were solely based on then-publicly available\nbusiness and financial information about Myovant. J.P. Morgan assumed and relied, without independent\nverification, upon the accuracy and completeness of such information. J.P. Morgan also considered such other\nfactors as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate.\nJ.P. Morgan assumed with the consent of Sumitovant that the financial analyses and forecasts for Myovant\nprepared by the management of Myovant were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgment of the management of Myovant, and that the financial analyses prepared by Sumitovant were\nreasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgment of Sumitovant, in each\ncase as of the date of the analysis or forecast. With respect to any financial forecasts, projections, other estimates\nand other forward-looking information provided to or otherwise obtained by J.P. Morgan from public sources, data\nsuppliers and other third parties, J.P. Morgan assumed that such forecasts, projections, other estimates and\ninformation were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\npreparer as to, and were a reasonable and reliable basis upon which to evaluate, the matters covered thereby. J.P.\nMorgan expressed no view as to any of the foregoing financial forecasts, projections, other estimates and other\nforward-looking information or the assumptions on which they were based. No representation or warranty, express or\nimplied, was made by J.P. Morgan in relation to the accuracy or completeness of the information presented in the J.P.\nMorgan Discussion Materials or their suitability for any particular purpose.\nJ.P. Morgan expressed no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied)\nregarding the reasonableness or achievability of any financial forecasts, projections, other estimates or other\nforward-looking information provided to, obtained or otherwise reviewed by, or discussed with,\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJ.P. Morgan, or the assumptions upon which they are based. J.P. Morgan did not conduct, and were not provided\nwith, any independent valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other\noff-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Myovant or any other company or business, nor did J.P. Morgan make any\nphysical inspection of the properties or assets of Myovant or any other company or business. J.P. Morgan did not\nexpress any view with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters and relied, with Sumitovant\u2019s\nconsent, upon the assessments of representatives of Myovant as to such matters.\nJ.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the prices at which Myovant common shares will trade at any time, or as\nto the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Purchaser Filing Persons,\nMyovant or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or as to the impact of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement on the solvency or viability of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant or\nthe ability of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant to pay their respective obligations when they come due. The\nmatters considered by J.P. Morgan in their financial analyses and reflected in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials\nwere necessarily based on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general business, economic and\ncapital markets conditions and industry-specific and company-specific factors as in effect on, and information made\navailable to J.P. Morgan as of the date of such J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. Many such conditions are beyond\nthe control of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant and J.P. Morgan. Accordingly, the financial analyses included\nin the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are inherently subject to uncertainty, and neither of J.P. Morgan nor any\nother person assumes responsibility if future results are different from those forecasted. Furthermore, it should be\nunderstood that subsequent developments may affect the views expressed in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials\nand that J.P. Morgan do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm their financial analyses or the J.P.\nMorgan Discussion Materials based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of such J.P.\nMorgan Discussion Materials. With respect to the financial analyses performed by J.P. Morgan in the J.P. Morgan\nDiscussion Materials, such financial analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. While none of the selected\nprecedent transactions used in the precedent minority squeeze-out analysis are identical to the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement and while none of the selected companies involved in such transactions are\nidentical or directly comparable to Myovant, the transactions were selected because they involved publicly traded\ncompanies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Myovant\nbased on the familiarity of J.P. Morgan with the biopharmaceutical industry. Such financial analyses do not purport to\nbe reports, appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares or other securities or financial instruments of or relating\nto the Myovant common shares may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.\nThe J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials are not, and should not be viewed as, a recommendation with respect to\nany matter pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The terms of the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the per share merger consideration, were determined solely\nthrough negotiations between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials did not\naddress the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other transactions\ncontemplated in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement compared to other\nbusiness strategies or transactions that may have been considered by the management of the Purchaser Filing\nPersons.\nSeptember 27 Materials\nOn September 27, 2022, at Sumitovant\u2019s request, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided Sumitovant with\ndiscussion materials (the \u201cSeptember 27 materials\u201d) containing a summary of recent Myovant stock price\nperformance, as well as preliminary financial analyses of the range of illustrative per Myovant common share values\nimplied by Myovant\u2019s 52-week high and low closing share prices, certain precedent minority squeeze-out premiums,\nwall street price targets and a discounted cash follow analysis. The 52-week trading price had ranged from $23.87\n(11/03/2021) to $7.78 (05/09/2022). The September 27 materials included a summary of the premiums paid in 19 U.S. all-\ncash minority squeeze-out transactions announced between March 2010 and June 2022.

The\nSeptember 27 materials also showed that, in the precedent minority squeeze-out transactions, an acquiror increased\nits final offer an average of 15.6% above its initial offer. The discounted cash flow analysis prepared based on the\nSumitovant management projections (as defined in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Projected Financial\nInformation-SMP Financial Information and Projections\u201d) indicated an illustrative range per Myovant common share\nof $22.50 (using a 12.25% discount rate) to $29.50 (using an 8.25% discount rate) (rounded to the nearest $0.50).\nThe September 27 materials also include a summary of Myovant\u2019s pro forma capitalization at illustrative per\nMyovant common share offer prices ranging from $20.00 to $30.00. The analysis indicated the premiums implied by\nsuch illustrative offer prices to Myovant\u2019s then-current per Myovant common share price of $16.82, to Myovant\u2019s 52-\nweek high and low closing share price, and to Myovant\u2019s VWAP over the trailing 30, 60 and 90 trading days.

Morgan was not asked to, and did not, render any opinion, report or appraisal as to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view or otherwise, of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or\nthe per share merger consideration to the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, the holders of any class of securities,\ncreditors or other constituencies of the Purchaser Filing Persons or Myovant. The J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials\nwere one of many factors taken into consideration by Sumitovant in its deliberations in connection with the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nJ.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that\nselecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of these analyses as a\nwhole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses. As a result, any potential\nindications of valuation resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were\nmerely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes. The order of analyses described does not\nrepresent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In preparing the J.P. Morgan\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscussion Materials, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered and\ndid not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation,\nsupported or failed to support the analysis set forth in the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials. Rather, J.P. Morgan\nconsidered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in preparing the J.P. Morgan Discussion Materials.\nMoreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be reports, appraisals or otherwise reflective of the\nprices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected transactions referred to in the\nabove summaries is identical to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and no company used in\nthe aforementioned analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Myovant. However, the transactions were\nchosen because they involve transactions that, for purposes of the analysis of J.P. Morgan, may be considered\nsimilar to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The analyses necessarily involve complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies\ninvolved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Myovant.\nJ.P. Morgan did not recommend any specific merger consideration to the Purchaser Filing Persons or that any\nspecific amount constituted the only appropriate merger consideration for the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement.\nJ.P. Morgan and its respective affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,\nsales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for\nvarious persons and entities. J.P. Morgan and its respective affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they\nmanage or in which they invest or have other economic interests, or with which they co-invest, may at any time\npurchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,\ncurrencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant and any of\ntheir respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of the holders of Myovant common stock, or any\ncurrency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, for the\naccounts of J.P. Morgan and their respective affiliates, employees and customers.\nBy letter agreement, dated February 18, 2022 (the \u201cJ.P. Morgan Engagement Letter\u201d), Sumitovant engaged J.P.\nMorgan to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nPursuant to the J.P. Morgan Engagement Letter, J.P. Morgan will receive a fee from Sumitovant of approximately $10\nmillion if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated. In addition, Sumitovant has\nagreed to indemnify J.P. Morgan for certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement and to reimburse J.P.\nMorgan for certain of their expenses. During the two years prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, J.P.\nMorgan and its affiliates have had other commercial or investment banking relationships with Sumitovant, for which\nJ.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received fees of approximately $350,000. During the two years prior to the execution\nof the Merger Agreement, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with\nMyovant, for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received fees of approximately $250,000. In the ordinary course\nof business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments\n(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, other parties\ninvolved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and their respective affiliates, as applicable, for\ntheir own account or for the account of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short\nposition or otherwise effect transactions in such securities or financial instruments.\nPurposes and Reasons of the Purchaser Filing Persons for the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the\nPurchaser Filing Persons are deemed to be \u201caffiliates\u201d of Myovant and engaged in a \u201cgoing-private\u201d transaction, and\ntherefore, may be required to disclose its purposes and reasons for the Merger to Myovant\u2019s \u201cunaffiliated security\nholders\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. The Purchaser Filing Persons are making the\nstatements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and\nrelated rules under the Exchange Act. However, the Purchaser Filing Persons are not making any recommendation to\nany Minority Shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on any proposal, and the views of each of the\nPurchaser Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder as to how such\nshareholder should vote. The Purchaser Filing Persons have interests in the Merger that are different from those of\nthe Minority Shareholders.\nIf the Merger is completed, Myovant will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant. As a result, the\nMyovant common shares will cease to be listed on the NYSE or publicly traded and will be deregistered under\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Exchange Act. Except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at least five\nbusiness days prior to the effective time, upon completion of the Merger (i) the board of directors of Merger Sub\nimmediately prior to the effective time will become the board of directors of Myovant and (ii) the officers of Myovant\nimmediately prior to the effective time will remain in place as the officers of Myovant following completion of the\nMerger.\nFor the Purchaser Filing Persons, the purpose of the Merger is to enable (i) Sumitovant to acquire 100%\nownership and control of Myovant in a transaction in which holders of Myovant common shares (other than\nMyovant common shares held by (a) Dissenting Holders, (b) Sumitovant or (c) Myovant or its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries) will receive $27.00 per Myovant common share, and (ii) the Purchaser Filing Persons to own 100% of the\nequity interests in Myovant after the Merger. In this regard, the Purchaser Filing Persons will bear the risks and\nrewards of such ownership in Myovant after the Merger, including any future earnings and growth of Myovant as a\nresult of improvements to Myovant\u2019s operations, synergies that may result from the Merger, acquisitions of other\nbusinesses, successful commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae, MYFEMBREE\u00ae and RYEQO\u00ae, as well as the successful\nclinical development and regulatory approval of other product candidates and other benefits of operating Myovant.\nThe Purchaser Filing Persons determined that the structuring of the transaction as a merger in which the\nMinority Shareholders receive $27.00 in cash for each Myovant common share is preferable to other transaction\nstructures as it provides the holders of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (a)\nDissenting Holders, (b) Sumitovant or (c) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) with immediate liquidity for\ntheir Myovant common shares through their receipt of the per share merger consideration, which represents a\npremium of approximately 50% to the closing price per Myovant common share on September 30, 2022 (the last\ntrading day prior to Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-binding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that\nSumitovant does not already own, on which date the closing price was $17.96) and a premium of approximately 55%\nto the 60-calendar day VWAP per Myovant common share through September 30, 2022 (which was $17.38).\nConversely, as a result of the Merger, the Minority Shareholders will no longer have an opportunity to participate in\nany future benefits associated with the ownership of the Myovant common shares, including the receipt of any\ndividends from Myovant in the future and participation in any potential appreciation in the trading price of the\nMyovant common shares beyond the per share merger consideration. The Minority Shareholders\u2019 receipt of cash in\nexchange for their Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to the Minority Shareholders who are U.S. Holders.\nIn addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons believe that structuring the transaction in such a manner is preferable\nto other alternative transaction structures because it (i) will enable the Purchaser Filing Persons to directly acquire all\nof the outstanding shares of Myovant not beneficially owned by them at the same time, (ii) will allow Myovant to\ncease to be a public reporting company, reducing management time and attention spent on those activities, as well as\noperating costs, (iii) will allow the Purchaser Filing Persons to control and determine investment strategies, reduce\ncommercial and execution risk in connection with the development and commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae and\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae and other future drug candidates, and (iv) is consistent with recent precedent transactions. Because\nthe transaction structure is consistent with the objectives of the Purchaser Filing Persons and with market practice,\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons did not pursue or propose an alternative transaction structure.\nIn deciding to pursue the Merger, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered and took into account various risks\nand other factors that potentially could adversely affect them. These included the possibility that the Merger could\nresult in the loss of key employees of Myovant or otherwise disrupt Myovant\u2019s business operations. The Purchaser\nFiling Persons also considered that its directors, officers and other employees would expend considerable time and\neffort in negotiating, implementing and completing the Merger, and in doing so their time would be diverted from\nother important business opportunities and operational matters. The Purchaser Filing Persons recognized that it\nwould incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the\nMerger is completed. There is a risk that the Merger may not be completed despite the Purchaser Filing Persons\u2019\nefforts, including in the event that the approval by a majority of the outstanding Myovant common shares held by\nthe Minority Shareholders is not obtained. Although each of the Purchaser\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFiling Persons believes that there will be significant opportunities associated with their investment in Myovant, the\nPurchaser Filing Persons realize that there are also substantial risks (including the risks and uncertainties relating to\nthe prospects of Myovant and as described in this paragraph) and that such opportunities may not be fully realized\non the expected timeframe or at all.\nThe Purchaser Filing Persons believe that after the Merger is consummated, Myovant should have greater\noperating flexibility and more efficient access to capital, which should support Myovant\u2019s long-term growth and\nprofitability, including due to (i) the reduction in expenses resulting from Myovant ceasing to be a public company,\n(ii) the ability of the Purchaser Filing Persons to efficiently provide certain administrative functions to Myovant and\n(iii) greater operational flexibility for Myovant to pursue alternatives than it would have as a public company,\nincluding the ability to pursue transactions without focusing on the reaction of the market or of the Minority\nShareholders to such transactions or the collective risk tolerance of such Minority Shareholders as it relates to such\ntransactions. If that happens, the Purchaser Filing Persons (and not the Minority Shareholders) will benefit from any\nresulting increase in the value of Myovant. Accordingly, the Purchaser Filing Persons have decided to undertake to\npursue the Merger at this time for the reasons described above.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, SMP, Sumitovant and their affiliates reserve the right, subject to\nthe Investor Rights Agreement, to acquire additional Myovant common shares through private purchases, market\ntransactions, tender or exchange offers or otherwise on terms and at prices that may be more or less favorable than\nthose provided in the Merger Agreement, or, subject to any applicable legal restrictions, to dispose of any or all\nMyovant common shares acquired by them. In the event that the Merger is not completed, then the Investor Rights\nAgreement will remain in place in accordance with its terms.\nPosition of the Purchaser Filing Persons as to Fairness of the Merger\nUnder the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing-private\u201d transactions, including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, the\nPurchaser Filing Persons are deemed to be \u201caffiliates\u201d of Myovant and engaged in a \u201cgoing-private\u201d transaction and,\ntherefore may be required to disclose its beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to Myovant\u2019s \u201cunaffiliated security\nholders\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. Each Purchaser Filing Person is making the statements\nincluded in this section of this proxy statement solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule\n13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. However, no Purchaser Filing Person is making any recommendation\nto any Minority Shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote on any proposal, and the views of each of\nPurchaser Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder as to how such\nshareholder should vote. Each Purchaser Filing Person has interests in the Merger that are different from those of the\nMinority Shareholders.\nThe Purchaser Filing Persons believe that the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms and conditions of\nthe Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, including the Merger, with the\nassistance of the independent financial advisor and legal counsel selected and retained by the Special Committee,\nrepresented the interests of the Minority Shareholders. While the members of the Purchaser Filing Persons are\nrepresented by the Sumitomo Directors on the Myovant Board, the Merger was negotiated and approved by the\nSpecial Committee. The Sumitomo Directors are not members of the Special Committee and did not participate in the\ndeliberations of the Special Committee regarding, or receive advice from the Special Committee\u2019s independent legal or\nfinancial advisors as to, the substantive and procedural fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders. The\nSumitomo Directors, in their capacity as members of the Myovant Board, also recused themselves from\ndeterminations related to a potential transaction with Sumitovant and SMP due to their affiliation with Sumitovant\nand/or SMP. The Purchaser Filing Persons did not undertake, or engage a financial advisor to undertake, any\nvaluation or other independent analysis for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the Merger or the per share\nmerger consideration to the Minority Shareholders.\nHowever, the Purchaser Filing Persons believe, based on the knowledge and analysis by the Purchaser Filing\nPersons of available information regarding Myovant and the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting\nconclusions of, the Special Committee described in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Reasons for the Merger\u037e\nRecommendation of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d (which analysis and\nresulting conclusions the Purchaser Filing Persons adopt, based on Purchaser Filing Persons\u2019 review thereof\nsubsequent to the execution of the Merger Agreement), that the Merger is substantively and procedurally fair to the\nMinority Shareholders.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn particular, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered the following substantive factors, among others, which\nare not presented in any relative order of importance:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical market prices of the Myovant common shares, and the fact that the $27.00 per\nshare merger consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 50% to the closing price of the\nMyovant common shares on September 30, 2022 (the last trading day prior to Sumitovant\u2019s initial non-\nbinding proposal to acquire the remaining Myovant common shares that Sumitovant does not already own,\non which date the closing price was $17.96), and (ii) a premium of approximately 55% based on the 60-\ncalendar day VWAP of the Myovant common shares through September 30, 2022 (which was $17.38)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe per share merger consideration is all cash, which provides immediate certainty of value and liquidity to\nthe Minority Shareholders, since such shareholders are able to realize the $27.00 per share merger\nconsideration for each of their Myovant common shares\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee received an opinion from Goldman Sachs, dated October 23, 2022, as to the fairness,\nfrom a financial point of view and as of such date to the Minority Shareholders of the $27.00 per share\nmerger consideration to be paid to such holders in connection with the Merger, which opinion was based\nupon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee,\u201d notwithstanding that the\nopinion of Goldman Sachs was provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee and\nnone of the Purchaser Filing Persons are entitled to, and did not, rely on such opinion\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger will eliminate the Minority Shareholders\u2019 exposure to the various risks and uncertainties related\nto continued ownership of Myovant common shares, which include among others:\n\u2022\nexposure to risks and uncertainties relating to the successful commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae and\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae, as well as the successful clinical development and regulatory approval of other\nproduct candidates\u037e\n\u2022\nexposure to market, economic and other risks that arise from owning shares in a public company\u037e\n\u2022\nany potential decline in the market prices of the Myovant common shares that may result from a\ngeneral economic slowdown\u037e\n\u2022\nother fluctuations in the value of the Myovant common shares based on general economic, business\nand industry conditions throughout the world\u037e\n\u2022\npotential volatility in the price of the Myovant common shares as a result of future developments\nbeyond Myovant\u2019s control, including government or regulatory action, and changes in tax laws,\ninterest rates and general market conditions\u037e\n\u2022\npotential impacts on the price and trading volumes of the Myovant common shares caused by analyst\nrecommendations and expectations and market sentiment\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe other risk factors disclosed in Myovant\u2019s most recent SEC filings.\n\u2022\nSumitovant\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger and pay the aggregate per share merger\nconsideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement are not conditioned on their obtaining financing\u037e and\n\u2022\nSMP has agreed to irrevocably guarantee to Myovant the due and punctual payment of all amounts\npayable by Sumitovant or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, including Sumitovant\u2019s and Merger\nSub\u2019s obligation to fund the aggregate per share merger consideration that is payable to the Minority\nShareholders.\nIn addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons considered the following procedural factors, which are not presented\nin any relative order of importance:\n\u2022\nunder the Investor Rights Agreement, the Purchaser Filing Persons are subject to various restrictions on\ntheir ability to influence or control the Myovant Board, including a contractual restriction, until\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDecember 27, 2022, requiring the Purchaser Filing Persons to obtain the approval of Myovant\u2019s Audit\nCommittee before making or publicly announcing a proposal for a merger, which gave the Audit Committee\nthe authority to pursue, or decline to pursue, negotiations with the Purchaser Filing Persons relating to a\nsale of Myovant, including the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Myovant Board established the Special Committee comprised solely of independent directors who are\nnot affiliated with the Purchaser Filing Persons and who are not officers or employees of Myovant, and\nwho are independent and disinterested with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, to\nconsider the Purchaser Filing Persons\u2019 proposal and to negotiate with the Purchaser Filing Persons\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee was advised by experienced and qualified outside legal counsel and financial\nadvisor, consisting of Skadden, as its legal counsel, Conyers, as its Bermuda legal counsel, and Goldman\nSachs, as its financial advisor\u037e\n\u2022\nthe authorization of the Special Committee to, among other things, (i) review and consider whether it would\nbe appropriate and desirable for Myovant to enter into a potential transaction with Sumitovant, (ii) develop,\nassess and negotiate the terms of a potential transaction with Sumitovant and alternatives thereto and (iii)\nmake a recommendation to the full Myovant Board as to whether Myovant should enter into such potential\ntransaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Sumitovant Board and the Purchaser Filing Persons were advised by experienced and qualified outside\nlegal counsel and financial advisor, consisting of Sullivan & Cromwell, as legal counsel, and J.P. Morgan, as\nfinancial advisor\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger is conditioned on the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares held by the Minority Shareholders, in addition to the approval of the holders of at least a\nmajority of the aggregate voting rights of the issued and outstanding Myovant common shares entitled to\nvote and voting at the special general meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement allows the Special Committee, subject to specific limitations and requirements set\nforth in the Merger Agreement, to withdraw its recommendation in favor of the Merger Proposal in\nresponse to a superior proposal or intervening event, subject to Myovant paying the Purchaser Filing\nPersons the termination fee of $55,250,000 in the case of an actual termination of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Special Committee was deliberative in its process to determine whether the Merger was fair to, and in\nthe best interests of, Myovant and its shareholders (including the Minority Shareholders) and to analyze,\nevaluate and negotiate the terms of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons did not participate in or have any influence on the deliberative process of, or\nthe conclusions reached by, the Special Committee or the negotiating positions of the Special Committee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons\u2019 obligation to consummate the Merger is not conditioned on any financing\nbeing obtained by the Purchaser Filing Persons, which increases the likelihood that the Merger will be\nconsummated and that the Minority Shareholders will receive the per share merger consideration of $27.00\u037e\n\u2022\nat the request of the Special Committee, Sumitovant entered into the Sumitovant Voting Agreement\npursuant to which and consistent with the Merger Agreement, Sumitovant is required to vote all Myovant\ncommon shares that it or its affiliates (other than Myovant and its subsidiaries) beneficially own in favor of\nthe Merger, with such obligation being applicable even if the Purchaser Filing Persons no longer wish to\nconsummate the Merger, which increases the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated and that the\nMinority Shareholders will receive the per share merger consideration of $27.00\u037e\n\u2022\nthe per share merger consideration resulted from extensive negotiations between the Special Committee and\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons and their respective advisors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves from determinations\nrelated to a potential transaction with Sumitovant due to their affiliation with Sumitovant and/or SMP),\nacting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, (i) determined that the per share\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger consideration constitutes fair value for each Myovant common share in accordance with the\nBermuda Companies Act, (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger\nAgreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory\nMerger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Myovant\nand its shareholders (including \u201cunaffiliated security holders,\u201d as defined under Rule 13e-3 under the\nExchange Act), (iii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the\nMerger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Sumitovant Voting\nAgreement, and (iv) subject to the right of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board (acting upon the\nrecommendation of the Special Committee) to change their recommendations in certain circumstances\nspecified in the Merger Agreement, determined to recommend that Myovant\u2019s shareholders vote in favor\nof the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger\nand the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and\nthe Sumitovant Voting Agreement, at a duly held meeting of Myovant\u2019s shareholders for such purpose\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe Minority Shareholders who do not vote for the Merger and who comply with certain procedural\nrequirements will be entitled, after completion of the Merger, to exercise statutory appraisal rights under\nBermuda law.\nIn the course of reaching their determination as to the fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders, the\nPurchaser Filing Persons also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the Merger\nAgreement and the Merger, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Minority Shareholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Myovant following the\nMerger and that those Minority Shareholders will (i) cease to participate in Myovant\u2019s future earnings or\ngrowth, if any, (ii) not benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the Myovant common shares and (iii)\nnot benefit from any potential sale to a third party in the future, including any of the foregoing that may\nresult from a successful launch and commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae and MYFEMBREE\u00ae\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or that the Merger might not be\nconsummated at all as a result of a failure to satisfy the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, and\nthe fact that a failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the trading price of Myovant or could\nresult in significant costs and disruptions to Myovant\u2019s normal business\u037e\n\u2022\nthe restrictions on the conduct of Myovant\u2019s business prior to the completion of the proposed Merger,\nwhich may delay or prevent Myovant from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain\nother actions it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of Myovant pending completion of the\nMerger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger is conditioned upon the approval of at least a majority of the outstanding Myovant\ncommon shares held by the Minority Shareholders, which reduces the certainty that the Merger will be\ncompleted\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that litigation may occur in connection with the Merger and any such litigation may result in\nsignificant costs and a diversion of management focus\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk, if the Merger is not consummated, that the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the\nrelationship of Myovant and its subsidiaries with their respective employees, suppliers, agents and others\nwith whom they have business dealings\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Sumitovant, in making its proposal to engage in the Merger, indicated that it is not interested\nin considering or participating in any transaction involving a sale of its Myovant common shares and that\nSumitovant\u2019s current beneficial ownership of the outstanding Myovant common shares, which is\napproximately 51.5% as of January 17, 2023, would discourage the making of a competing acquisition\nproposal from third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement\nuntil the effective time of the Merger, Myovant is subject to certain restrictions on its\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information\nto third parties and to engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals,\nsubject to customary exceptions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Myovant has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in\nconnection with the potential transaction, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk related to amounts that may be payable by Myovant upon the termination of the Merger\nAgreement, including the termination fee of $55,250,000, and the process required to terminate the Merger\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe fact that the receipt of per share merger consideration in exchange for each Myovant common share\npursuant to the Merger generally will be taxable to U.S. Holders (as defined below in the section entitled \u201c-\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) of Myovant common shares.\nThe Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider net book value, which is an accounting concept, for purposes of\ndetermining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because the Purchaser Filing\nPersons believed that net book value is neither indicative of Myovant\u2019s market value nor its value as a going\nconcern, but rather an indicator of historical costs.\nIn addition, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not conduct a going-concern valuation of the Myovant common\nshares for purposes of determining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because,\nfollowing the Merger, Myovant will have a significantly different capital structure and because the Purchaser Filing\nPersons believe that the trading price of Myovant common shares at any given time represents the best available\nindicator of Myovant\u2019s going-concern value at that time, so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted by\nspeculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction.\nMoreover, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider the liquidation value of Myovant in determining the\nsubstantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders because (i) of their belief that liquidation sales\ngenerally result in proceeds substantially less than the sales of a going concern, (ii) of the impracticability of\ndetermining a liquidation value given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup, (iii) they considered\nMyovant to be a viable going concern and (iv) the Purchaser Filing Persons anticipate that Myovant\u2019s operations\nwill continue to be conducted substantially as they currently are being conducted.\nFinally, the Purchaser Filing Persons did not consider the purchase prices of Myovant common shares paid by\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons in previous purchases of Myovant common shares during the two years preceding the\nsigning of the Merger Agreement in determining the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders\nbecause they did not consider those prices to represent the best available indicator of Myovant\u2019s pre-Merger value\nbut rather to be indicative of historical prices, as described above.\nIn making their determination as to the substantive fairness of the Merger to the Minority Shareholders, the\nPurchaser Filing Persons were not aware of any firm offers having been received by Myovant from anyone other than\nthe Purchaser Filing Persons in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement for (i) the merger or\nconsolidation of Myovant with another company, (ii) the sale or transfer of all or any substantial part of Myovant\u2019s\nassets or (iii) a purchase of Myovant\u2019s securities that would enable the holder to exercise control of Myovant.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Purchaser Filing\nPersons in connection with the fairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but includes all factors\nconsidered by the Purchaser Filing Persons that they believe to be material. The Purchaser Filing Persons did not find\nit practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the individual factors considered in\nreaching their conclusions as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather, the fairness determinations were made after\nconsideration of all of the foregoing factors as a whole. The Purchaser Filing Persons believe these factors provide a\nreasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Minority\nShareholders. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Minority Shareholder to\napprove the Merger Agreement. The Purchaser Filing Persons make no recommendation as to how the Minority\nShareholders of Myovant should vote their shares relating to the Merger. The Purchaser Filing Persons attempted to\nnegotiate the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the Minority Shareholders, and,\naccordingly, did not negotiate the Merger Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such Minority\nShareholders.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

As the surviving company in the\nMerger, Myovant will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitovant.\nAt the effective time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, the memorandum of association\nand the bye-laws of Merger Sub, each as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will become the\nmemorandum of association and bye-laws of the surviving company.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, all of the equity interests in Myovant, as the surviving company, will be\nbeneficially owned by the Purchaser Filing Persons and none of the Minority Shareholders will, by virtue of the\nMerger, have any direct ownership in, or be a shareholder of, Myovant, the surviving company or the Purchaser\nFiling Persons. As a result, the Minority Shareholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will\nthey bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Myovant common shares. Following the Merger, the Purchaser\nFiling Persons will benefit from any increase in Myovant\u2019s value and will also bear the risk of any decrease in\nMyovant\u2019s value.\nAt the effective time, each holder of Myovant common shares (other than Myovant common shares held by (i)\nDissenting Holders, (ii) Sumitovant or (iii) Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the\neffective time will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share held and all such Myovant\ncommon shares will, at the effective time, be cancelled, be no longer outstanding, and automatically cease to exist.\nPlease see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Effect of the Merger on the Myovant\nCommon Shares and Merger Sub.\u201d\nFor information regarding the effects of the Merger on Myovant\u2019s outstanding equity awards, please see the\nsections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Treatment of Myovant Equity Awards\u201d and \u201cSpecial Factors-Interests of\nMyovant\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe Myovant common shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act and trade on the NYSE under the\nsymbol \u201cMYOV.\u201d Following the completion of the Merger, the Myovant common shares will no longer be traded on\nthe NYSE or any other public market. In addition, the registration of the Myovant common shares under the\nExchange Act will be terminated, and Myovant will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the\nSEC with respect to the Myovant common shares or otherwise. Termination of registration of the Myovant common\nshares under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be furnished by Myovant to Myovant\u2019s\nshareholders and the SEC, and would make provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual\nand quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of\nSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with shareholders\u2019\nmeetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Myovant. Myovant will become the\nbeneficiary of the cost savings achieved by Myovant no longer remaining a company subject to the reporting\nrequirements under the federal securities laws.\n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Effects of the Merger on the Purchaser Filing Persons\nFollowing the consummation of the Merger, Sumitovant will own all of the equity interests of Myovant and be\nthe sole beneficiary of future earnings, growth and value, and will be the only shareholder entitled to vote on\ncorporate matters affecting Myovant.\nAdditionally, following the Merger, the Myovant common shares will be delisted from the NYSE, will be\nderegistered under the Exchange Act and will cease to be publicly traded. See the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Plans for Myovant After the Merger.\u201d As such, Myovant will be relieved of the\nrequirements applicable to public companies, including, among other things, the pressure to meet analyst forecasts\nand the requirements and restrictions on trading that directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of\nthe shares of the common shares face as a result of the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Myovant will\nalso be relieved of the obligation to separately prepare and furnish information to its shareholders.\nThe primary detriments of the Merger to the Purchaser Filing Persons include the fact that all of the risk of any\npossible decrease in the future earnings, growth or value of Myovant following the Merger will be borne by the\nPurchaser Filing Persons. Additionally, the Purchaser Filing Persons\u2019 ownership of Myovant will be illiquid, with no\npublic trading market for such securities.\nThe table below sets forth the beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares and resulting interests in\nMyovant\u2019s net book value and net loss of the Purchaser Filing Persons prior to and immediately after the\nconsummation of the Merger, based on Myovant\u2019s net book value at September 30, 2022 and net loss for the six\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, as if the Merger were completed on such date:\n \nPrior to the Consummation of the Merger\nAfter the Consummation of the Merger\n(in thousands, except\n%)\n% \nOwnership(1)\nNet book \nvalue at \nSeptember\n30, \n2022(1)\nNet loss \nfor the six \nmonths\nended \nSeptember\n30, \n2022(1)\n% \nOwnership\nNet book \nvalue at \nSeptember\n30, \n2022\nNet loss \nfor the six \nmonths\nended \nSeptember\n30, \n2022\nSumitovant and its\naffiliates\n51.8%\n$(265,992)\n$(34,649)\n100%\n$(513,249)\n$(66,858)\n \n(1)\nCalculated based on 96,557,652 Myovant common shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and Sumitovant\u2019s ownership as\nof September 30, 2022 of 50,041,181 Myovant common shares.",

The Special\nCommittee considered the risks and potential likelihood of achieving greater value for the Minority Shareholders by\npursuing potential strategic alternatives to the Merger, including continuing as a separate public company or\npursuing an alternative transaction with a third party, in each case, relative to the benefits of the Merger. In this\nregard, the Special Committee took into account that Sumitovant, as the holder of a majority of Myovant common\nshares, has an effective veto over any alternative transaction, and that Sumitovant stated in its initial non-binding\nproposal letter delivered on September 30, 2022 that it had no interest in selling any of the Myovant common shares it\nowns nor approving any alternative sale, merger or similar transaction involving Myovant.

        "Section Text": "Projected Financial Information\nMyovant Management Projections\nMyovant does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term financial projections because of, among\nother reasons, the uncertainty and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates and the unpredictability\nof Myovant\u2019s business and the competitive markets in which it operates. However, in connection with the Special\nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of a potential transaction with Sumitovant, Myovant management prepared and provided to\n62TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs, who then presented to the Special Committee on June 28, 2022, the Initial\nProjections, related to periods from fiscal year 2022 to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2036 (\u201cfiscal year 2035\u201d). At\nthe direction of the Special Committee, the Initial Projections were revised by Myovant management and were\nsuperseded by the Revised Projections, which reflect revised underlying assumptions as described below, related to\nperiods from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2036. The Revised Projections were initially presented to the Special\nCommittee at its meeting on August 3, 2022 and did not change thereafter. In this section of the proxy statement, we\nrefer to the Initial Projections and the Revised Projections together as the \u201cFinancial Projections.\u201d The Financial\nProjections are based on certain assumptions made by management, and were based on preliminary five-year\nprojections for the periods from fiscal year 2022 through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027 (\u201cfiscal year 2026\u201d)\nthat had been presented by management to the Myovant Board in March 2022 as part of Myovant\u2019s regular long-\nrange planning process and were shared with J.P. Morgan. The Revised Projections were used by Goldman Sachs\nwith the Special Committee\u2019s approval for purposes of preparing Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses and fairness\nopinion provided to the Special Committee on October 23, 2022 in connection with the Special Committee\u2019s\nconsideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in the section\nentitled \u201cSpecial Factors-Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee.\u201d\nThe summary of the Financial Projections is included in this proxy statement because the Financial Projections\nwere made available to Goldman Sachs for the purpose of rendering an opinion that is materially related to the\nproposed transaction with Sumitovant and SMP and are being disclosed in order to comply with the SEC rules or\nrequirements under applicable law, including case law regarding disclosure of the financial advisor\u2019s analyses. The\nFinancial Projections included in this proxy statement, other than preliminary five-year projections that had been\npresented by management to the Myovant Board in March 2022 and subsequently shared with J.P. Morgan, which\nwere subsequently incorporated into the Financial Projections, were not shared with the Purchaser Filing Persons or\ntheir advisors prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Financial Projections were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view toward public\ndisclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC\nregarding forward-looking statements or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), but, in the view of\nMyovant management, were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and\njudgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation. No independent registered public\naccounting firm provided any assistance in preparing the Financial Projections. Accordingly, no independent\nregistered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the\nFinancial Projections or expressed any opinion or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto, and they\nassume no responsibility for the information contained in the Financial Projections. The Ernst & Young LLP report\nincluded in Myovant\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (\u201cfiscal year 2021\u201d)\nrelates solely to the historical financial information of Myovant and to an assessment of Myovant\u2019s internal controls\nover financial reporting. Such reports do not extend to the Financial Projections and should not be read to do so.\nThe inclusion of the Financial Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Myovant, Sumitovant or\ntheir respective affiliates or financial advisors or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this\ninformation considered, or now considers, the Financial Projections to be necessarily predictive of future results.\nThere can be no assurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower\nor higher than estimated, whether or not the Merger is completed. None of Myovant, Sumitovant or their respective\naffiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not\ndiffer from the Financial Projections, and, except as required by applicable law, none of Myovant, Sumitovant or their\nrespective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Financial Projections to\nreflect circumstances existing after the date the Financial Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of\nfuture events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Financial Projections are shown to\nbe inappropriate. None of Myovant or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or\nmakes any representation to any Myovant shareholder or other person regarding the information included in the\nFinancial Projections or Myovant\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Financial\nProjections or that forecasted results will be achieved. Myovant has made no representation to Sumitovant, in the\nMerger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Financial Projections. The Financial Projections are forward-looking\nstatements. The assumptions and estimates underlying the Financial Projections, all of which are difficult to predict\nand many of which are beyond the control of Myovant, may not be realized. Neither Myovant nor any of its affiliates\nassumes any responsibility to holders of Myovant common shares for the accuracy of this information. In particular,\nthe Financial\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProjections, while presented with numerical specificity necessarily, were based on numerous variables and\nassumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,\ncompetitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontained in the Financial Projections. Because the Financial Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they\nbecome subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that\nwill have an effect on the commercial value of ORGOVYX\u00ae, MYFEMBREE\u00ae, RYEQO\u00ae and Myovant\u2019s product\ncandidates. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Financial Projections accurately reflect future trends or\naccurately estimate the future market for ORGOVYX\u00ae, MYFEMBREE\u00ae, RYEQO\u00ae and Myovant\u2019s product candidates.\nThere can be no assurance of the approval, or timing of such approval, of any of Myovant\u2019s clinical-stage product\ncandidates, and it is possible that other therapeutic scenarios will be preferable. Important factors that may affect\nactual results and results in the Financial Projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to: the success\nand cost of Myovant\u2019s commercialization of its approved products and product candidates, if approved\u037e the impact\non Myovant\u2019s business, financial results, results of operations and ongoing clinical trials from the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\u037e risks related to development programs, including the success and anticipated timing of\nMyovant\u2019s ongoing and future clinical and non-clinical studies, and uncertainties relating to the success of\nMyovant\u2019s clinical trials for its product candidates and any future therapy or product candidates\u037e uncertainties\nsurrounding the regulatory landscape that governs Myovant\u2019s products and product candidates, including risks\nrelated to regulatory approval, including the timing and status of anticipated future regulatory submissions and\nMyovant\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for its product candidates\u037e the ability to obtain,\nmaintain, and enforce intellectual property protection for Myovant\u2019s products and product candidates\u037e risks related\nto significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies\u037e and other risks identified in\nMyovant\u2019s SEC filings, including Myovant\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 and Myovant\u2019s most\nrecent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and described under the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.\u201d The Financial Projections also reflect\nassumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change.\nModeling and forecasting the future commercialization of products and clinical, pre-clinical and research stage\nproduct candidates is a highly speculative endeavor. In addition to the various limitations, risks and uncertainties\ndescribed above, we also cannot assure you that Myovant will obtain and maintain any of the regulatory approvals\nnecessary for the commercialization of ORGOVYX\u00ae, MYFEMBREE\u00ae, RYEQO\u00ae and its product candidates, or that\nMyovant\u2019s competitors will not commercialize products that are safer, more effective or more successfully marketed\nand sold than any products that Myovant may commercialize in the future.\nThe Financial Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Myovant management believes are\nhelpful in understanding Myovant\u2019s financial performance and future results. Myovant management regularly uses a\nvariety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring\nfinancial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for comparable GAAP measures. While Myovant believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide\nmeaningful information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze Myovant\u2019s financial and\nbusiness trends on a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported\nby all of Myovant\u2019s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of Myovant\u2019s\ncompetitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise\nrequire a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business\ncombination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition,\nreconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Special Committee or its independent\nfinancial advisor in connection with their respective evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly, Myovant has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Projections to the relevant\nGAAP financial measures.\nThe Financial Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they\nwere prepared, and, except as may be required in order to comply with applicable securities laws, Myovant does not\nintend to update or otherwise revise the Financial Projections, or the specific portions presented, to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the date when they were made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the\nevent that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error. For the foregoing reasons, as well as the bases and\nassumptions on which the Financial Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the Financial\nProjections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such projections are an accurate\nprediction of future events, and they should not be relied on as such.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMyovant management prepared the Revised Projections, which were provided to the Special Committee, the\nMyovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs. The Revised Projections are the final\nprojections that were made available to, and relied upon by, the Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other than\nthe Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs in connection with their evaluation of the proposed transaction with\nSumitovant and SMP. Myovant management had previously prepared the Initial Projections, which were also\nprovided to the Special Committee and Goldman Sachs. However, the Initial Projections were revised and superseded\nby the Revised Projections and therefore were not relied upon by the Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other\nthan the Sumitomo Directors) or Goldman Sachs.\nThe Initial Projections were reviewed and adjusted by Myovant management based upon feedback provided by\nthe Special Committee, which adjustments included, without limitation, (i) modifying certain assumptions about the\nprobability of success for the contraceptive label impact on MYFEMBREE\u00ae revenue projections (from 100% to 72%),\n(ii) updating the assumed worldwide loss of exclusivity for certain patent protections associated with ORGOVYX\u00ae\nand MYFEMBREE\u00ae currently in the market to begin in 2036 rather than 2035 and (iii) updating the loss of exclusivity\nfor certain patent protections associated with new indications of Myovant\u2019s existing products from 2033 to 2036.\nThese different assumptions are further described in the key assumptions underlying the Revised Projections and in\nthe key assumptions underlying the Initial Projections set forth below.\nRevised Projections\nThe Special Committee, the Myovant Board (other than the Sumitomo Directors) and Goldman Sachs relied upon,\namong other things, the following key assumptions underlying the Revised Projections:\n\u2022\n3% annual price increase for ORGOVYX\u00ae and MYFEMBREE\u00ae\u037e\n\u2022\nvolume growth (i) of approximately 11% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2028 (\u201cfiscal year 2027\u201d),\nstepping down to approximately 3% by fiscal year 2036, for ORGOVYX\u00ae, (ii) ranging from approximately 8%\nto approximately 45% in fiscal year 2027 and ranging from 0% to approximately 33% thereafter for\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae and (iii) of 0% until the start of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031 and growing\napproximately 54% on average per year thereafter for a product candidate under development\u037e\n\u2022\nprobability of success (i) of 100% for ORGOVYX\u00ae, (ii) ranging from 75% to 100% for MYFEMBREE\u00ae\n(based on different indications, including 100% for use in the treatment of endometriosis in pre-menopausal\nwomen) and (iii) 5% for a product candidate under development\u037e\n\u2022\ncash flows discounted to June 30, 2022, using the mid-year convention\u037e\n\u2022\nchange in working capital assumed to be $0 in terminal year\u037e\n\u2022\n14% corporate effective tax rate and tax savings associated with NOLs discounted at WACC\u037e\n\u2022\nutilized $1.027 billion of NOLs (80% of taxable income for post-2017 NOLs) and $2 million in existing\nResearch & Development tax credit as of March 31, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\n2036 worldwide loss of exclusivity representing that Myovant has exclusivity on ORGOVYX\u00ae and\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae through at least 2036 both within and outside the United States, after which generic\nerosion is assumed (sensitivity of annual erosion of 60% to 100% within the financial analysis)\u037e\n\u2022\ncontraceptive label impact on MYFEMBREE\u00ae revenue projections at 72% probability of success\u037e and\n\u2022\nloss of exclusivity for certain new indications of

not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance\ndue to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the\nlikelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, SMP provided certain non-\npublic financial projections to J.P. Morgan in its capacity as SMP\u2019s financial advisor as part of the due diligence\nprocess.\nSumitovant\u2019s management teams developed long-range financial projections for ORGOVYX\u00ae and\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae, relating to projected product revenue, milestone and royalty revenue, cost of goods sold,\ncollaboration expense to Pfizer, selling, general & administrative expenses, research & development expenses,\ndepreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and net working capital values as adjusted by the probability of\nsuccess through fiscal year 2036, which we refer to as the \u201cSumitovant management projections,\u201d such adjustments\nassuming 100% probability of success for ORGOVYX\u00ae in prostate cancer and 100% probability of success for\nMYFEMBREE\u00ae in uterine fibroids and endometriosis. The Sumitovant management projections also included a\nprobability of success adjustment of 60% in fiscal year ended March 31, 2030 and beyond to account for uncertainty\naround the exclusivity period for ORGOVYX\u00ae and MYFEMBREE\u00ae. The Sumitovant management projections were\nprepared based on budgets and information provided by Myovant in the ordinary course of business and not for\npurposes of a potential merger. Sumitovant made its own assessments and adjustments to develop the Sumitovant\nmanagement projections. The Sumitovant management projections incorporated the latest assumptions relating to\nORGOVYX\u00ae\u2019s and MYFEMBREE\u00ae\u2019s development plans, cost and timing, loss of exclusivity, as well as a current\nanalysis of the competitive environment in the commercial forecasts of ORGOVYX\u00ae and MYFEMBREE\u00ae.\nThe Sumitovant management projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on\nnumerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and many of which will be beyond Myovant\u2019s\n(and following the completion of the Merger, SMP\u2019s) control. Because the Sumitovant management projections cover\nmultiple years, by its nature, this information becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The\nassumptions upon which the Sumitovant management projections were based necessarily involve judgments with\nrespect to, among other things, development timelines, likelihood of clinical success, product pricing, market uptake,\nreimbursement and potential competition, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of\nwhich are beyond Myovant\u2019s control. The Sumitovant management projections also reflect assumptions as to certain\nbusiness decisions and transactions that are subject to change and may not occur, at all or on the terms assumed.\nImportant factors that may affect actual results and result in the Sumitovant management projections not being\nachieved include, but are not limited to: (i) the availability and level of third-party reimbursement for Myovant\u2019s\nproducts and services\u037e (ii) market acceptance of such products and services\u037e (iii) the introduction of new products\nand services\u037e (iv) access to sufficient capital\u037e (v) the impact of competition\u037e (vi) the effect of regulatory actions\u037e (vii)\nthe effect of global economic conditions\u037e (viii) changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations\u037e and (ix) other risk\nfactors described in Myovant\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary\nStatement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.\u201d In addition, the Sumitovant management projections may be\naffected by Myovant\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period.\nThe Sumitovant management projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and,\naccordingly, do not necessarily comport with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial\ninformation or generally accepted accounting principles. The summary of the Sumitovant management\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprojections is not being included in this proxy statement to influence a shareholder\u2019s decision regarding whether to\nvote in favor of the Merger Proposal but rather because the Sumitovant management projections represent an\nassessment by SMP\u2019s management of future performance and cash flows that was used in the financial analyses of\nJ.P. Morgan described above.\nThe Sumitovant management projections set forth below do not take into account any circumstances or events\noccurring after the date they were prepared, including the announcement of the Merger and transaction-related\nexpenses. The Sumitovant management projections also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the\nMerger to close and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nThe inclusion of the Sumitovant management projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an\nindication that SMP or Myovant or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or\nconsider the Sumitovant management projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Sumitovant\nmanagement projections should not be relied on as such. Neither the Purchaser Filing Persons, Myovant, nor any of\ntheir respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives can give any assurance that actual results\nwill not differ from these Sumitovant management projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to\nupdate or otherwise revise or reconcile the Sumitovant management projections to reflect circumstances existing\nafter the date such Sumitovant management projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Sumitovant management projections are\nshown to be in error or no longer appropriate. Neither the Purchaser Filing Persons nor Myovant intends to make\npublicly available any update or other revision to the Sumitovant management projections except as required by law.\nNeither the Purchaser Filing Persons nor Myovant nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any shareholder or other investor regarding the ultimate\nperformance of Myovant compared to the information contained in the Sumitovant management projections or that\nprojected results will be achieved.\nThe Minority Shareholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Sumitovant management\nprojections included in this proxy statement. \nThe Sumitovant management projections incorporate certain financial measures, including earnings before\ninterest and taxes, or EBIT, net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, and free cash flow to the firm, or FCF, which are\nnot measures under generally accepted accounting principles. Such financial measures should not be considered in\nisolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. SMP\u2019s or J.P. Morgan\u2019s calculations of these financial measures may differ from others in its\nindustry and are not necessarily comparable with information presented under similar captions used by other\ncompanies.\nSubject to the foregoing qualifications, the following is a summary of the Sumitovant management projections:\nFYE Mar-31\n$ in\nmillions\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\n2036\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 610 $1,159 $1,545 $2,120 $ 2,100 $ 2,316 $1,521 $2,057 $1,785 $ 1,888 $ 1,899 $1,763 $1,817 $2,140\nCost of\nGoods Sold\n(incl.\ncollaboration\nexpense to\nPfizer)\n$(328) $ (577) $ (785) $ (971) $(1,125) $(1,254) $ (804) $ (882) $ (956) $(1,013) $(1,019) $ (943) $ (972) $ (993)\nAdj.

The members of the Special Committee and the Myovant Board\n(other than the Sumitomo Directors, who recused themselves) were aware of and considered these interests, among\nother matters, in recommending the Merger Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement be adopted and\napproved by Myovant shareholders.\n69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMyovant\u2019s shareholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the\nnarrative and the tables below.\nEquity Awards\nEquity awards granted by us to our directors and executive officers under the Equity Plans that are outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and such\ndirectors and executive officers will receive cash payments in exchange for such equity awards in connection with the\nMerger.\n\u2022\nMyovant Options\nEach option to purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and\nunexercised immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise price per\nMyovant common share that is less than $27.00 will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash\npayment for each Myovant common share that is subject to such option equal to the difference between $27.00 and\nthe per share exercise price of such option (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). Each option\nto purchase Myovant common shares granted under the Equity Plans that is outstanding and unexercised\nimmediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise price per Myovant\ncommon share that is equal to or greater than $27.00 will be cancelled without payment.\n\u2022\nRestricted Share Units and Performance Share Units\nEach Myovant RSU that has not been settled in Myovant common shares prior to the effective time will be\ncancelled, except as provided in the paragraph below, and converted into the right to receive, in respect of each such\nMyovant RSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00 multiplied by the number of Myovant common shares subject to such\nMyovant RSU immediately prior to the effective time (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes).\nEach Myovant PSU that has not been settled in Myovant common shares prior to the effective time will be cancelled\nand converted into the right to receive, in respect of each such Myovant PSU, a cash payment equal to $27.00\nmultiplied by the number of Myovant common shares subject to such Myovant PSU (deeming performance goals as\nbeing satisfied) immediately prior to the effective time (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes).\nOn October 26, 2022, certain Myovant RSUs were granted to non-executive directors (other than Dr. Nishinaka)\nin lieu of the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options pursuant to the Non-Executive Director\nCompensation Plan that otherwise would have been granted to such non-executive directors. These Myovant RSUs\nshall (x) vest in full on the earlier to occur of (i) October 26, 2023 and (ii) the date that is one day prior to Myovant\u2019s\n2023 annual shareholder meeting, subject in each case to such non-executive director providing continuous service\nto Myovant through such date, or (y) to the extent the Myovant RSUs have not vested as of the effective time, vest\npro rata based on the number of days such non-executive director has served since October 26, 2022.

The beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares is shown differently in this section (as compared to the\nsection entitled \u201cOther Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Security Ownership of Management and\nCertain Beneficial Owners\u201d) to avoid double counting of the equity awards in the table above. See the columns under the headings,\n\u201cVested Options\u201d and \u201cOptions, Myovant PSUs and Myovant RSUs Subject to Vesting\u201d in the table above for additional\ninformation.\n(4)\nFor each non-executive director (other than Dr. Nishinaka), this column represents the number of Myovant RSUs that would vest\npro-rata upon the effective time of the Merger. At an October 23, 2022 Myovant Board meeting, the Myovant Board (other\nthan the Sumitomo Directors) unanimously determined that in lieu of the regular and automatic annual grant of stock options\npursuant to the Non-Executive Director Compensation Plan to non-executive directors, each non-executive director (other than\nDr. Nishinaka) would be granted an award of Myovant RSUs pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, effective October 26,\n2022, with a grant value equal to $266,200 in the aggregate. The number of Myovant RSUs subject to each grant was calculated\nby dividing $266,200 by the per share merger consideration (provided that the number of Myovant RSUs subject to each grant\nwas rounded down to the nearest share). These Myovant RSUs shall (x) vest in full on the earlier to occur of (i) October 26, 2023\nand (ii) the date that is one day prior to Myovant\u2019s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, subject in each case to such non-executive\ndirector providing continuous service to Myovant through such date, or (y) to the extent the Myovant RSUs have not vested as\nof the effective time, vest pro rata based on the number of days such non-executive director has served since October 26, 2022.\nThe vested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled in exchange for the Myovant RSU consideration as set forth in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Treatment of Myovant Equity Awards-Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units,\u201d and the\nunvested Myovant RSUs shall be cancelled without payment as of the effective time.\nFor additional information about beneficial ownership of Myovant common shares by our directors and\nexecutive officers, see \u201cOther Important Information Regarding Myovant Sciences Ltd.-Security Ownership of\nManagement and Certain Beneficial Owners.\u201d\nEmployment Agreements with Executive Officers\nMyovant has entered into employment agreements with David Marek, Uneek Mehra and Lauren Merendino and\namended and restated employment agreements with Matthew Lang and Dr. Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira (collectively,\nthe \u201cEmployment Agreements\u201d), which provide for certain severance benefits and certain benefits upon a change in\ncontrol.\nSeverance Benefits. The Employment Agreements generally provide that if the executive is terminated from\nemployment by Myovant other than for cause or the executive terminates employment with good reason (as such\nterms are defined in the Employment Agreements) within three months before, upon or within 18 months after (or in\nthe case of Mr. Marek, within 12 months after) a change in control (as such term is defined in the Employment\nAgreements), then the executive officer will receive a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to one times\n(or in the case of Mr. Lang, 1.5 times) the sum of the executive\u2019s base salary and the executive\u2019s target annual bonus\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfor the year of termination. In the event of such a qualifying termination, Myovant will also reimburse the total\namount of COBRA premiums (or in the case of Mr. Marek, Myovant\u2019s portion of his COBRA premium) for the first 12\nmonths of COBRA coverage for the executive and the executive\u2019s eligible dependents (or in the case of Mr. Lang, the\nfirst 18 months). If Myovant determines, in its sole discretion, that it cannot provide the COBRA premium benefits\nwithout potentially incurring financial costs or penalties after a COBRA election has been made, eligible executives\nwill be entitled to receive monthly a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premium (or in the case of Mr.\nMarek, 200% of Myovant\u2019s portion of his COBRA premium) for the duration of the period that reimbursement would\notherwise be available. With respect to Mr. Marek only, in the event of such a qualifying termination, Myovant will\nprovide payment equal to Mr. Marek\u2019s cost of living adjustment payments for a period covering 12 months following\nthe date of termination (provided that in no event will he be entitled to receive any cost of living adjustment\npayments following the fifth anniversary of his employment start date). Pursuant to the Employment Agreements, the\nprovision of severance payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer\u2019s execution\nand non-revocation of a release of claims.\nChange in Control Benefits. The Employment Agreements further provide that if an executive is terminated from\nemployment by Myovant other than for cause or the executive terminates employment with good reason (as such\nterms are defined in the Employment Agreements) within three months before, upon or within 18 months after (or in\nthe case of Mr. Marek, within 12 months after) a change in control (as such term is defined in the Employment\nAgreements), 100% of the then unvested portion of each of such executive officer\u2019s outstanding equity awards will\nbecome fully vested (except with respect to Mr. Lang, as described below). Mr. Lang\u2019s Employment Agreement\nprovides that upon a change in control during the term of Mr. Lang employment (or within three months following\ntermination of his employment other than for cause), Mr. Lang will become fully vested in 100% of the then unvested\nportion of each of his outstanding equity awards. For the treatment of equity awards in the Merger, see the section\nabove entitled \u201c-Equity Awards.\u201d In addition, pursuant to Mr. Lang\u2019s amended and restated employment agreement,\nupon a change in control, Mr. Lang will become entitled to an additional payment equal to his prorated bonus (based\non the higher of target or actual achievement of pro rata performance targets for the number of days that have\nelapsed in such fiscal year as of the change in control) for the number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal year as\nof the change in control.\nThe parties have agreed to treat the consummation of the Merger as a \u201cchange in control\u201d (or similar term) of\nMyovant for purposes of determining severance entitlements under Myovant\u2019s benefit plans and all employee\nagreements, including these Employment Agreements.\nBonus Protections Under the Merger Agreement\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, to the extent not paid prior to consummation of the Merger, Myovant\u2019s\nexecutive officers will receive their annual bonus payments on the regular annual bonus payment date (subject to\nsuch executive officer\u2019s continued employment through such regular annual bonus payment date), based on\nperformance goals established by Myovant at the beginning of the fiscal year 2022 and accounting for partial\nattainment of performance goals consistent with historical practice (but not discretionarily reduced for individual\nperformance factors unless determined by Myovant\u2019s Principal Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee).\nIn the event that an employee\u2019s employment is terminated, under circumstances entitling the employee to severance\nafter the effective time and prior to the regular payment date of the annual bonus for fiscal year 2022, such employee\n(including the executive officers of Myovant) will become entitled to receive payments of a pro-rated target annual\nbonus for fiscal year 2022 as soon as reasonably practicable following such date of termination.\nQuantification of Non-Equity Related Entitlements of Executive Officers\nThe following table summarizes the estimated value to be received by each of our named executive officers for\npurposes of this proxy statement pursuant to the executives\u2019 respective entitlements under the Employment\nAgreements and under the Merger Agreement, other than the equity interests which are quantified above. For\npurposes of the following table, we have assumed that (i) the effective time occurred on January 17, 2023, (ii) the\nemployment of each named executive officer was terminated by Myovant without cause or by the named executive\nofficer for good reason, in each case immediately following the effective time for purposes of termination-related\nseverance or other payments, (iii) a pro rata annual bonus for fiscal year 2022 will be paid at target in respect of the\nperiod employed\u037e and the target annual bonus for this purpose is equal to the executive\u2019s target short-term incentive\ncompensation for fiscal year 2022, and (iv) the additional payment for Mr. Lang will be based on his target short-term\nincentive compensation for fiscal year 2022.\n \n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nName\nCash \nSeverance \n($)\nCOBRA\nPremium\nPayments\n($)\nPro-Rated\nFiscal Year\n2022\nAnnual Bonus\nUnder the\nMerger\nAgreement \n($)\nAdditional\nPayment \n($)\nTotal \nPayments \n($)\nDavid Marek\n$1,480,000\n$38,483\n$446,466\n-\n$1,964,949\nUneek Mehra\n$ 840,000\n-\n$223,233\n-\n$1,063,233\nMatthew Lang\n$1,260,000\n$56,166\n$223,233\n$223,233\n$1,762,632\nJuan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D.\n$ 795,000\n$38,483\n$211,274\n-\n$1,044,757\nLauren Merendino\n$ 780,000\n$38,483\n$207,288\n-\n$1,025,771\nDirectors and Executive Officers of Myovant Following the Effective Time\nIf the Merger is completed, except as otherwise determined by Sumitovant and notified in writing to Myovant at\nleast five business days prior to the effective time, (i) Myovant\u2019s officers immediately prior to the effective time will\nbe the officers of the surviving company following the effective time\u037e and (ii) the directors of Merger Sub immediately\nprior to the effective time will be the directors of the surviving company following the effective time.\nIndemnification / Insurance\nThe Bye-Laws provide for indemnification of directors and executive officers against certain liabilities that may\narise by reason of their status or service as directors or executive officers. Myovant has also entered into agreements\nwith its directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in the Bye-\nLaws. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing\nindemnification from Sumitovant and the surviving company and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies for at least six years following the Merger. The indemnification and insurance provisions in the\nMerger Agreement are further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Other Covenants and\nAgreements-Indemnification of Directors and Officers\u037e Insurance.\u201d\nCompensation of the Special Committee\nThe Special Committee consists of three independent members serving on the Audit Committee, Mark Guinan\n(Chairman), Terrie Curran and Nancy Valente. Each member of the Special Committee will receive compensation of\n$50,000 for such member\u2019s service on the Special Committee and the Chairman of the Special Committee, Mark\nGuinan, will receive an additional $15,000 for service as the Chairman of the Special Committee. These fees are not\ndependent on the closing of the Merger or on the Special Committee\u2019s or the Myovant Board\u2019s approval of, or\nrecommendation with respect to, the Merger.\nMerger Related Compensation\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for\neach named executive officer of Myovant that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. This compensation is\nreferred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use\nsuch term to describe the Merger related compensation payable to Myovant\u2019s named executive officers. Our named\nexecutive officers are not employees of Myovant, but rather are employees of Myovant Sciences, Inc., a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Myovant, which provides services to us pursuant to an intercompany services agreement. For\npurposes of this disclosure, Myovant\u2019s named executive officers are (i) David Marek, Principal Executive Officer, (ii)\nUneek Mehra, Principal Financial Officer, (iii) Matthew Lang, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, (iv) Dr. Juan\nCamilo Arjona Ferreira, Chief Medical Officer and (v) Lauren Merendino, Chief Commercial Officer. The \u201cgolden\nparachute\u201d compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of Myovant\u2019s\nshareholders.\nThe following table sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each named executive officer will or\nmay receive in connection with the Merger. For purposes of quantifying these potential payments and benefits for\nthe table below, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nthe effective time of the Merger occurred on January 17, 2023, the latest practicable date prior to this filing\u037e\n\u2022\nthe employment of each named executive officer was terminated by Myovant without cause or by the\nnamed executive officer for good reason, in each case immediately following the effective time for purposes\nof termination-related severance or other payments\u037e\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\na pro rata annual bonus for fiscal year 2022 will be paid at target in respect of the period employed\u037e and the\ntarget annual bonus for this purpose is equal to the executive\u2019s target short-term incentive compensation\nfor fiscal year 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe value per share of Myovant common shares of $27.00, which is equal to the per share merger\nconsideration.\nIn addition, no assumption has been made regarding Myovant\u2019s regular long-term incentive awards that may be\nmade to executive officers during fiscal year 2023 should the effective time occur after March 31, 2023, as such\nawards are not presently determinable and are subject to the consent of Sumitovant.

This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial\nopinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), each as in\neffect as of the date of this proxy statement. These provisions are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis,\nand any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.\nMyovant has not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the Merger, and,\nas a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the tax consequences described below.\nThis discussion applies only to holders of Myovant common shares who hold such shares as a \u201ccapital asset\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion\ndoes not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of\nsuch holder\u2019s particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws (including insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders\nin securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S.\ndollar, tax-exempt organizations, cooperatives, banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain\nexpatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other\nentities, controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies, holders who own or have owned\n(directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of the Myovant common shares (by vote or value), persons who\nare required to recognize income or gain with respect to the Merger no later than such income or gain is required to\nbe reported on an applicable financial statement under Section 451(b) of the Code, and holders who hold Myovant\ncommon shares as part of a straddle, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, holders who will own, through the\napplication of certain constructive ownership rules, an equity interest in the surviving company, holders who\nacquired their Myovant common shares through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation\narrangements, Myovant or its wholly owned subsidiaries, Sumitovant, or Dissenting Holders). Moreover, this\ndiscussion does not address the tax consequences of the Merger arising under any applicable state, local or foreign\ntax laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Myovant common shares\nthat is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or\norganized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\na trust (i) if the administration over such trust is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the\nUnited States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the\ntrust\u037e or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a\nU.S. person\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Myovant common shares that is not a U.S. Holder or a\npartnership.\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) holds Myovant common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally\ndepend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding\nMyovant common shares, you should consult your tax advisor.\nYou are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof the Merger to you, as well as any consequences to you arising under any state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsequences to U.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, subject to the \u201cpassive foreign investment\ncompanies,\u201d or \u201cPFIC,\u201d rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Myovant common\nshares pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between\n(1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such Myovant common shares.\nCapital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally eligible for the preferential long-term capital\ngains rate if such individual U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in Myovant common shares exchanged in the Merger is\ngreater than one year as of the effective date of the Merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Myovant common shares at different times and different\nprices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each\nblock of Myovant common shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations. Generally, if, for any taxable year, at least 75% of\nMyovant\u2019s gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of its assets is attributable to assets that\nproduce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, Myovant would be\ncharacterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes\ndividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than\nrents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or\nbusiness. Additionally, a look-through rule generally applies with respect to 25% or more owned subsidiaries.\nMyovant\u2019s status as a PFIC will depend on the nature and composition of its income and the nature,\ncomposition and value of its assets from time to time. The asset test is generally based on the fair market value of\neach asset, with the value of goodwill and going concern value determined in large part by reference to the market\nvalue of Myovant common shares, which may be volatile. With respect to the taxable year that ended on March 31,\n2022, Myovant believes that it was not a PFIC. However, Myovant cannot predict whether it will or will not be\nclassified as a PFIC in the current or future taxable year because the PFIC tests are based upon the average value of\nits assets, including any goodwill and going concern value, and the nature and composition of its income and assets,\nin each taxable year, which cannot be known at this time. Because the determination of whether Myovant is a PFIC\nfor any taxable year is a fact-intensive determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, and because\ncertain aspects of the PFIC rules are uncertain, Myovant therefore cannot provide any assurances regarding its PFIC\nstatus for the current or future taxable year.\nIf Myovant is, or, at any time prior to the Merger, was, a PFIC, any gain recognized from the receipt of cash in\nexchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nholding period for the Myovant common shares, the amount allocated to the taxable year in which the gain is realized\nand to taxable years prior to the first year in which Myovant was classified as a PFIC would be taxable as ordinary\nincome and the amount allocated to each other year would be subject to tax as ordinary income at the highest tax rate\nin effect for that tax year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax would be imposed in\nrespect of the tax attributable to each such year. At the same time, any loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes in the\nMerger will generally be a capital loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. In addition, special\ninformation reporting may be required.\nThe tax consequences that would apply if Myovant is or was classified as a PFIC may be different from those\ndescribed above if a U.S. Holder had made a valid \u201cqualified electing fund,\u201d or \u201cQEF,\u201d election. At this time, Myovant\ndoes not expect to provide U.S. Holders with the information necessary for a U.S. Holder to make a QEF election in\nthe event that Myovant is a PFIC.\n77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsequences to Non-U.S. Holders\nA non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized\nfrom the Merger unless:\n\u2022\nsuch gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder\u2019s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if\nrequired by an applicable treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by\nthe non-U.S. Holder in the United States)\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear in which the Merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied.\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the\nsame manner as a U.S. Holder with respect to the receipt of cash in exchange for Myovant common shares in the\nMerger. A non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a rate of\n30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) on the portion of its effectively connected\nearnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments, attributable to the gain realized upon the\nexchange of Myovant common shares in the Merger.\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a\n30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) on any gain recognized with respect to the\nMyovant common shares surrendered in the Merger, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses.\nUnited States Backup Withholding and Information Reporting\nA U.S. Holder will generally be subject to information reporting, on IRS Form 1099, with respect to the receipt of\ncash in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger that is paid within the United States or\nthrough some U.S. related financial intermediaries to U.S. Holders, unless the U.S. Holder is a corporation or comes\nwithin certain other categories of exempt recipients. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient will generally be\nsubject to backup withholding with respect to the cash received in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant\nto the Merger unless the U.S. Holder timely provides a taxpayer identification number and complies with the other\napplicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. Holder who fails to provide a correct taxpayer\nidentification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.\nNon-U.S. Holders will generally be subject to information reporting and possible backup withholding with\nrespect to the cash received in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the disposition of the Myovant\ncommon shares effected within the United States, unless the non-U.S. Holder certifies to its foreign status or\notherwise establishes an exemption and the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder\nis a U.S. Holder. Payments of cash in exchange for Myovant common shares pursuant to the Merger within the\nUnited States by a payor within the United States to a non-U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding if such\nnon-U.S. Holder fails to provide appropriate certification, which includes a valid IRS Form W-8 or other\ndocumentation upon which the payor or broker may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-US person. In the\ncase of such payments by a payor within the United States to a foreign partnership other than a foreign partnership\nthat qualifies as a \u201cwithholding foreign partnership\u201d within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations, the partners of\nsuch partnership will be required to provide the certification discussed above in order to establish an exemption from\nbackup withholding tax and information reporting requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be\nallowed as a refund or credit against a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information\nis furnished to the IRS.\nThis discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information only and is not tax advice.\nYou are urged to consult your own tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to your\nparticular situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under\nthe laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction.\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

The defendants intend to vigorously defend against these claims and\nbelieve the claims asserted in this complaint are without merit.\nOther potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger. The outcome of the\nSchiffenbauer and Halberstam actions and any additional future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not\nresolved,\n79TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncould prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Myovant, including any costs\nassociated with the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the Closing is the absence of\nany law or order from a governmental entity (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and\nrestrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in\nobtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction\nmay prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe. The defense\nor settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely\naffect Myovant\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

Prior to such termination, and in connection with the funding of term loans pursuant to the Hercules Loan\nAgreement, Myovant issued to Hercules (i) a warrant, dated October 16, 2017, to purchase up to 49,800 Myovant\ncommon shares at an exercise price of $15.06 per Myovant common share, and (ii) a warrant, dated March 26, 2018, to\npurchase up to 23,910 Myovant common shares at an exercise price of $18.82 per Myovant common share (the\nwarrant in clauses (i) and (ii), the \u201cMyovant warrants\u201d). As of January 17, 2023, an aggregate of 73,710 Myovant\ncommon shares remained subject to purchase upon the exercise of the Myovant warrants.\nTo the extent any of the Myovant warrants are not exercised in full prior to the effective time, pursuant to the\nterms set forth in the Myovant warrants, the Myovant warrants will be deemed to have been automatically exercised\nin full with respect to any remaining Myovant common shares subject to purchase thereunder pursuant to the net\nexercise provisions set forth in the Myovant warrants. As a result of such automatic net exercise, the holder of each\nMyovant warrant will receive a number of Myovant common shares equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the\nnumber of Myovant common shares then subject to purchase pursuant to such Myovant warrant and (B) the\ndifference between the per share merger consideration and the then-effective exercise price of such Myovant warrant,\ndivided by (ii) the per share merger consideration. Following such automatic net exercise, at the effective time, each\nMyovant common share received by the holder of a Myovant warrant will be treated the same as the other Myovant\ncommon shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.",

At the end of the six business day period, prior to\ntaking action to effect an adverse recommendation change or taking action to terminate the Merger Agreement in\naccordance with its terms, the Special Committee and the Myovant Board will take into account any changes to the\nterms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Sumitovant in writing and any other information offered by Sumitovant\nin response to the notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and\nits financial advisor that (i) in the case of a superior proposal, the superior proposal would continue to constitute a\nsuperior proposal, and (ii) in the case of an intervening event, that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation\nchange in response to such intervening event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under applicable law, in each case, if such changes offered in writing were to be given effect. Any\nmodification to any alternative acquisition proposal will be deemed to be a new alternative acquisition proposal for\npurposes of the Merger Agreement, except that the six business day advance written notice obligation set forth in\nthis section will be reduced to three business days.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an \u201cintervening event\u201d means any material fact, event,\ncircumstance, development or material change in circumstances with respect to Myovant and its subsidiaries, taken\nas a whole, that:\n\u2022\nwas unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Special Committee as of the date of the Merger\nAgreement\u037e and\n\u2022\ndoes not relate to (a) any alternative acquisition proposal\u037e (b) the announcement or pendency of the\nMerger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Statutory Merger\nAgreement and the Sumitovant Voting Agreement, unless such facts, events, circumstances, developments\nor changes in circumstances, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a\nParent Material Adverse Effect\u037e (c) any facts, events, circumstances or changes in circumstances that\nresult from a breach of the Merger Agreement by Myovant, (d) the fact that Myovant meets or exceeds any\ninternal or analysts\u2019 expectation or projections (provided, however, that a fact, condition, change,\ndevelopment or event underlying or that contributed to such failure may be taken into account in\ndetermining whether there has been an intervening event) or (e) changes after the date of the Merger\nAgreement in the market price or trading volume of Myovant common shares or the credit rating of\nMyovant (it being understood that matters underlying the changes described in this clause (e) may, to the\nextent not in contravention of the foregoing bullet, be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account, in\ndetermining whether there has been an intervening event).\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that nothing will prohibit Myovant from (i) complying with its disclosure\nobligations under United States federal or state law with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal or adverse\nrecommendation change\u037e (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Myovant Board (acting upon the\nrecommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with\nand receiving advice of its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be\ninconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e provided, however, that if such disclosure has\nthe substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Myovant recommendation, such disclosure shall be\ndeemed to be an adverse recommendation change and Sumitovant shall have the right to terminate the Merger\nAgreement unless Myovant reaffirms the Myovant recommendation\u037e or (iii) issuing a \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d or\nsimilar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, which shall not be deemed\nto be an adverse recommendation change.",

        "Section Text": "RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL\nUnder Bermuda law, in the event of a merger of a Bermuda company with another Bermuda company or foreign\ncorporation, any shareholder of the Bermuda company is entitled to receive fair value for its shares. For purposes of\nSection 106(2)(b)(i) of the Bermuda Companies Act, the Myovant Board considers the fair value for each Myovant\ncommon share to be $27.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nAny shareholder of Myovant who is not satisfied that it has been offered fair value for its shares and whose\nshares are not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal may exercise its appraisal rights under the Bermuda Companies\nAct to have the fair value of its shares appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda. Persons owning beneficial\ninterests in shares but who are not shareholders of record should note that only persons who are shareholders of\nrecord are entitled to make an application for appraisal. Any shareholder of Myovant intending to exercise appraisal\nrights must file its application for appraisal of the fair value of its shares with the Supreme Court of Bermuda within\none month after the date the notice convening the special general meeting to approve the Merger has been given.\nThe notice delivered with this proxy statement constitutes this notice. There are no statutory rules, and there are\nlimited decisions of the Supreme Court of Bermuda that prescribe in detail the operation of the provisions of Section\n106 of the Bermuda Companies Act or the process of appraisal by the Supreme Court of Bermuda\u037e the Supreme Court\nof Bermuda retains considerable discretion as to the precise methodology that it would adopt when determining the\nfair value of shares in an appraisal application under the Bermuda Companies Act.\nIf a shareholder of Myovant votes in favor of the Merger Proposal at the special general meeting, such\nshareholder will have no right to apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to appraise the fair value of its shares, and\ninstead, if the Merger is consummated, and as discussed in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Effect of the Merger on the Myovant Common Shares and Merger Sub,\u201d each Myovant common share of\nsuch shareholder will be cancelled and will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration. Voting\nagainst the Merger, or not voting, will not in itself satisfy the requirements for notice and exercise of a shareholder\u2019s\nright to apply for appraisal of the fair value of its shares.\nA FAILURE OF A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER TO AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO HAVE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS COMMON\nSHARES APPRAISED, PROVIDED THAT SUCH SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL.\nIn any case where a registered holder of Myovant common shares has made an appraisal application (having\nalready received the per share merger consideration), in respect of the shares held by such dissenting shareholder,\nand the Merger has been made effective under Bermuda law before the Supreme Court of Bermuda\u2019s appraisal of the\nfair value of such Myovant common shares, then the dissenting shareholder shall be entitled to receive the fair value\nof the Myovant common shares held by such holder if later appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda to be greater\nthan the value of the per share merger consideration received. Such dissenting shareholder will be paid the\ndifference, between the amount paid to him as the per share merger consideration and the value appraised by the\ncourt within one month of the Supreme Court of Bermuda\u2019s appraisal.\nIn any case where the value of the Myovant common shares held by a dissenting shareholder is appraised by\nthe Supreme Court of Bermuda before the Merger has been made effective under Bermuda law, then the surviving\ncompany will be required to pay the dissenting shareholder within one month of the Supreme Court of Bermuda\u2019s\nappraisal an amount equal to the value of the Myovant common shares appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda,\nunless the Merger is terminated under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which case no payment will be made.\nHowever, it is anticipated that, subject to having obtained the requisite approval, the Merger would have proceeded\nprior to the appraisal by the Supreme Court of Bermuda.\nA shareholder that has exercised appraisal rights has no right of appeal from an appraisal made by the Supreme\nCourt of Bermuda. The responsibility for apportioning the costs of any application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda\nunder Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act will be in the discretion of the Supreme Court of Bermuda.\n122TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe relevant portion of Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act in relation to appraisal rights is as follows:\n\u201c(6) Any shareholder who did not vote in favour of the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied that he\nhas been offered fair value for his shares may within one month of the giving of the notice referred to in\nsubsection (2) apply to the Court to appraise the fair value of his shares.\n(6A) Subject to subsection (6B), within one month of the Court appraising the fair value of any shares under\nsubsection (6) the company shall be entitled either-(a) to pay to the dissenting shareholder an amount equal to\nthe value of his shares as appraised by the Court\u037e or (b) to terminate the amalgamation or merger in accordance\nwith subsection (7).\n(6B) Where the Court has appraised any shares under subsection (6) and the amalgamation or merger has\nproceeded prior to the appraisal then, within one month of the Court appraising the value of the shares, if the\namount paid to the dissenting shareholder for his shares is less than that appraised by the Court, the\namalgamated or surviving company shall pay to such shareholder the difference between the amount paid to\nhim and the value appraised by the Court.\n(6C) No appeal shall lie from an appraisal by the Court under this section.\n(6D) The costs of any application to the Court under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court.\n(7) An amalgamation agreement or merger agreement may provide that at any time before the issue of a\ncertificate of amalgamation or merger the agreement may be terminated by the directors of an amalgamating or\nmerging company, notwithstanding approval of the agreement by the shareholders of all or any of the\namalgamating or merging companies.\u201d\nSHAREHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR\nBANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS AND OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE COMMON SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD\nOF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM AND OTHER\nNOMINEE MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A\nTIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nA shareholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act\nshould, in addition to making an application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, mail or deliver a written demand to:\nAttn: Corporate Secretary, Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.\nMyovant Sciences Ltd.\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nClarendon House\n2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11 \nBermuda",
