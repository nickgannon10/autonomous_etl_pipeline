The Merger Agreement provides for Buyer to acquire\nthe Company in a Merger for a price of $86.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon. You are\nreceiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company's Board in\nfavor of the Merger Proposal and to approve the other related proposals to be voted on at the Special\nMeeting.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Special Meeting will be held at SPX FLOW, Inc., 13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina 28277, on March 3, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) (including any adjournment or\npostponement thereof). This Special Meeting will be a held in person.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nOnly holders of record of the Company common stock as of the close of business on January 31, 2022,\nthe Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their\nshares at the Special Meeting. Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding as of\nthe close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote\nat the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nYou will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto approve the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nHow many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\nA:\nA quorum will be present if holders of not less than one-third of the shares of the Company common\nstock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are present or represented by\nproxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the chairperson of the Special Meeting has the\npower to adjourn the Special Meeting without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a\nquorum is present or represented.\nAs of the close of business on January 31, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, there were\n42,058,085 shares of common stock outstanding.\nIf you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on\nthe proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present\nat the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?\nA:\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the vote of a majority of the shares of common stock\noutstanding at the close of business entitled to vote on the Record Date for the Special Meeting \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe Merger Proposal.\n12TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct\nthe nominee how to vote your shares, the failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve the remaining proposals to be voted\nupon at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nEach of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company common stock present, in person or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote, at the Special Meeting.\nAn abstention with respect to either proposal, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock\n(including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have\nthe same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d these proposals. Because all proposals for the Special Meeting\nare non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes for such proposals.\nQ:\nHow does the Company's Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nOur Board unanimously recommends that SPX FLOW stockholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Advisory Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Company's Board considered in determining to recommend the\napproval of the Merger Agreement, please see the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 1 - The Merger-\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board.\u201d In addition, in considering the\nrecommendation of our Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of\nour directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of Company stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the\nsection entitled \u201cProposal No. 1 - The Merger-Interests of SPX FLOW's Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nHow do SPX FLOW's directors and officers intend to vote?\nA:\nWe currently expect that SPX FLOW's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of\nthe Merger Proposal and the other proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting, although they\nhave no obligation to do so.\nQ:\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA:\nAs of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger during the first\nhalf of calendar year 2022. However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of\nthe conditions to the completion of the Merger, which are described in this proxy statement and include\nregulatory clearances, and it is possible that the Merger will not be completed until a later time, or at\nall.\nThere may be a substantial amount of time between the Special Meeting and the completion of the\nMerger. After the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, our Board will not have the right to terminate the\nMerger Agreement in order to accept any Alternative Acquisition Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by the Company's stockholders, or if the Merger is not\ncompleted for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of\ncommon stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, SPX FLOW will remain a public company, and\nshares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed\nand traded on the NYSE. In the event that the Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination\nFee or Buyer fails to promptly pay the Buyer Termination Fee, and in order to obtain such payment,\nBuyer, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a legal proceeding that\nresults in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee, or against\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBuyer for the Buyer Termination Fee, or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay\nBuyer, or Buyer shall pay the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and expenses\n(including attorney's fees) in connection with such legal proceeding (including interests) (the amounts\nreferred to in the foregoing, the \u201cCollection Costs\u201d)\u037e provided, that in no event shall the Collection Costs\nexceed $10,000,000.\nIn the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Buyer as a consequence of\nnot receiving the Requisite Company Vote, under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee\nis not then payable, then the Company will reimburse Buyer and its affiliates for all of their reasonable\nand documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,\naccountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to Buyer and Merger Sub and their affiliates)\nincurred by Buyer or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,\npreparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and performance of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby (the \u201cBuyer Expenses\u201d), up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000\u037e\nprovided, that the payment by the Company of the Buyer Expenses pursuant to this paragraph shall not\nrelieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee to the extent\nrequired by the Merger Agreement. Payment of the Buyer Expenses shall be made by wire transfer of\nsame-day funds to the accounts designated by Buyer within two business days after the Company\nreceived notice and documentation with respect to amounts validly due under this paragraph.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nWe urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and\nthe documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger\naffects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own.\nVoting\nStockholders of record will be able to vote at the Special Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record,\nbut instead hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other\nnominee, you must provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other\nnominee in order to be able to vote at the Special Meeting.\nIt is not necessary to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your\nshares of common stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting\ninstructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting.\nAttending the meeting does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.\nShares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder\nYou can also ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting by submitting your proxy via:\n\u2022\nmail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the\nenclosed postage-paid envelope\u037e\n\u2022\ntelephone, by viewing the proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com and using a touch-tone\nphone and the toll-free number\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe Internet, at www.proxyvote.com and the 12-digit control number on the enclosed proxy\ncard.\nThe telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern\nTime) on March 2, 2022.\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a\nproposal, your proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d (1) the Merger Proposal, (2) the Advisory Compensation\nProposal, and (3) the Adjournment Proposal.\nWe encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the Special Meeting.\nA failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal\nand on the other two proposals (assuming, in the case of a failure to vote, that a quorum is present).\nShares of Common Stock Held in \u201cStreet Name\u201d\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the\ndirections provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or\nother\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the\nMerger Proposal, the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nCan I revoke my proxy?\nA:\nYes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a\nstockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by notifying SPX FLOW at SPX FLOW, Inc., 13320\nBallantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277, Attention: Scott Gaffner, or by submitting\na new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the\nenclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke\nyour proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting\u037e however, simply attending the Special Meeting\nwill not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and\nyou have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the\ninstructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If\nyou hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting at the Special\nMeeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to\nbe able to vote at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares\nof common stock outstanding on the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote,\nor abstain from voting, on the Merger Proposal and the other two proposals, it will have the same effect\nas a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each such proposal.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nThe inclusion of the Advisory Compensation Proposal is required by the rules of the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)\u037e however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the\ncompletion of the Merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and will not\nbe binding on SPX FLOW or Buyer. If the Merger Agreement is approved by our stockholders and the\nMerger is completed, the Merger-related compensation is expected to be paid to our named executive\nofficers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if\nstockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWill my shares of Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by\na different stockholder (that is, your custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares\nof common stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own\nshares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a\ntrust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy\ncard for those shares of common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership.\nShares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized\nofficer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card.\nShares of common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules\ngoverning the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, you\nshould read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?\nA:\nIf your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will\nreceive more than one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy\ncards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the\nInternet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the Merger?\nA:\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through\ncompletion of the Merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion\nof the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the Merger.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the completion\nof the Merger. If you transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the closing\nof the Merger, you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the\nmerger consideration.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the\npaying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common\nstock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are\nheld in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your\nbroker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your\n\u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your stock\ncertificates now.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the Per Share Price for my\nshares of common stock?\nA:\nYes. As a holder of SPX FLOW common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the\nDGCL, in connection with the Merger if you take certain actions, meet certain conditions and fully\ncomply with the requirements set forth under the DGCL, including that you do not vote (in person or by\nproxy) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. These procedures are summarized in the section\nentitled \u201cAppraisal Rights of SPX FLOW Stockholders.\u201d In addition, the text of the applicable appraisal\nrights provisions of Delaware law is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nFailure to strictly comply with these provisions will result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or\nmore stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company\nprovides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to\nreceive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted\nhouseholding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has\nmultiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification from\nyour broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of\nthis proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement\npromptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to\nhousehold, and thereby receive multiple copies.\nQ:\nWhere can I find more information about SPX FLOW?\nA:\nYou can find more information about SPX FLOW from various sources described in the section entitled\n\u201cWhere You Can Find Additional Information.\u201d\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWho can help answer my other questions?\nA:\nIf you have more questions about the Merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting\nyour shares or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please\ncontact D.F.

SPX FLOW assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for\nany reason, except as required by law. In addition to other factors and matters contained in or incorporated\nby reference in this document, we believe the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those discussed in the forward-looking statements:\n\u2022\nthe failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the closing conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied or waived, including\nthat a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval\u037e\n\u2022\ndelay in closing the transaction or the possibility that the transaction may not be completed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks related to the disruption of the transaction to the Company and its management\u037e\n\u2022\nlimitations placed on our ability to operate our business under the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe effect of announcement of the transaction on SPX FLOW's ability to retain and hire key\npersonnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, subcontractors, regulators and\nother third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the Merger may affect the timing or\noccurrence of the Merger or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and\nrisks associated with other litigation relating to our business\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks relating to adverse outcomes in legal proceedings other than in connection with the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nrisks relating to changes generally affecting the nutrition health and precision solutions markets\u037e\n\u2022\ndisruption of SPX FLOW's significant supplier relationships\u037e\n\u2022\ndisruption in SPX FLOW's manufacturing systems\u037e and\n\u2022\nother risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended 2020, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents\nfiled by us with the SEC after the date thereof.

        "Section Text": "Background to the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement and\ndoes not purport to catalogue every conversation, nor the details of every conversation, involving the Board,\nthe Committee (as defined below), management or other representatives of SPX FLOW and other parties.\nOther than as described below and for contacts in the ordinary course of our business, there have been no\nmaterial contacts between SPX FLOW and Lone Star in the two years preceding the signing of the Merger\nAgreement.\nOn September 26, 2015, SPX Corporation distributed 100% of the common stock of SPX FLOW to its\nstockholders in a spin-off transaction (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d). Since the consummation of the Spin-Off, the Board\nand SPX FLOW's management have regularly reviewed SPX FLOW's business strategy and strategic plan in\nlight of SPX FLOW's competitive position, industry trends and other potential challenges and opportunities in\nexecuting such business strategy and strategic plan. As part of this regular review, the Board and\nmanagement have also worked together to evaluate performance against SPX FLOW's strategic plan\n(including its short- and long-term operational and stock price performance) and to identify strategic and\nfinancial opportunities to maximize stockholder value. In addition, to assist SPX FLOW in connection with\ncertain strategic matters (including in connection with assisting it evaluating and responding to unsolicited\nacquisition proposals), SPX FLOW retained Morgan Stanley in March of 2016 to act as its financial advisor.\nBeginning in 2018, SPX FLOW initiated a focus on enhancing stockholder value by improving gross margins\nand increasing recurring revenue. Consistent with these objectives, SPX FLOW conducted a detailed\nstrategic review of its product lines, working with an external consultant to focus on the products and market\nverticals where SPX FLOW had a strong value proposition for customers and could grow profitably. This\nstrategic review also included a plan to focus its Food and Beverage Systems business to emphasize\nprocess technologies with a strong value proposition to customers. The review also led the Board to the\ndecision to divest its former Power and Energy reportable segment business in a transaction that closed on\nMarch 30, 2020. During 2020, SPX FLOW also launched an \u201c80/20\u201d initiative designed to utilize a data driven\napproach to identify and focus efforts on products and customers in target markets that were likely to\ngenerate higher growth and higher margins. These efforts, together with other initiatives, resulted in adjusted\noperating margins increasing from approximately 8.1% in 2018 to approximately 11.8% for the first three\nquarters of 2021, an improvement of 370 basis points.\n24TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn 2021, SPX FLOW remained focused on continued execution of the 80/20 initiative and other efforts\ndesigned to further improve gross margins, including through overall enterprise productivity enhancements\nand reductions in SG&A and supply chain costs.\nOn March 11, 2021, SPX FLOW hosted a virtual investor day in which it highlighted its three year strategic\nobjectives to achieve (i) low- to mid- single digit organic revenue growth, (ii) mid-teens operating income\nmargins and (iii) acquired revenue of $200-300 million. The investor day presentation also noted the four\nfoundational pillars supporting these objectives: (i) profitable growth, (ii) high return investments, (iii)\nimproved customer experience and (iv) strong commitment to people and culture.\nOn May 5, 2021, SPX FLOW announced results for its first fiscal quarter that reflected a year over year\nincrease in organic revenue of 19% and a significant improvement in gross margins.\nIn early May, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley became aware through its ongoing dialogue with\nrepresentatives of Ingersoll Rand Inc. (\u201cIngersoll Rand\u201d), on an unsolicited basis, of Ingersoll Rand's possible\ninterest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with SPX FLOW. Representatives of Morgan Stanley\nupdated Marcus Michael, President and Chief Executive Officer of SPX FLOW, of this information, who\nsubsequently updated Robert Hull, the Chairman of the Board and Peter Ryan, SPX FLOW's Chief People\nOfficer and General Counsel.\nAt the Board's regularly scheduled meeting on May 12, 2021, Mr. Michael informed the Board of the\ninformation he had learned from representatives of Morgan Stanley about Ingersoll Rand's possible interest\nin a strategic transaction and the Board authorized Mr. Michael to engage in preliminary discussions with\nIngersoll Rand in the event he was contacted by Ingersoll Rand.\nOn May 13, 2021 and May 14, 2021, Mr. Michael and Vincente Reynal, chief executive officer of Ingersoll\nRand, through a series of emails initiated by Mr. Reynal, arranged a lunch meeting for May 18, 2021.\nAt the lunch meeting on May 18, 2021, Mr. Reynal indicated that Ingersoll Rand had conducted diligence\nbased on publicly available information and would be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of SPX\nFLOW. Mr. Michael told Mr. Reynal that he appreciated the interest and that SPX FLOW and its Board\nwould take seriously any opportunity to create value for SPX FLOW and its stockholders. No discussions\noccurred at this meeting with respect to price, structure or any other potential terms related to a transaction.\nFollowing the lunch meeting on May 18, 2021, Mr. Michael separately briefed Messrs. Hull and Ryan on his\nconversation with Mr. Reynal. Thereafter, Mr. Ryan apprised SPX FLOW's outside counsel, Winston &\nStrawn LLP (\u201cWinston\u201d), of the meeting between Messrs. Michael and Reynal. This discussion between Mr.\nRyan and Winston included a review of, among other things, the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering\na potential offer by Ingersoll Rand and the guidelines that management not engage in discussions with any\npotential acquiror concerning post-closing compensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted\nby the Board.\nOn or around May 19, 2021, Mr. Michael directed Morgan Stanley to update its annual valuation materials\non the Company.\nOn May 22, 2021, Mr. Michael provided an oral update on his conversations with Mr. Reynal to a broader\ngroup of directors that included Mr. Hull, David Singer and Patrick Campbell.\nOn May 26, 2021, Mr. Michael placed a telephone call to Mr. Reynal. During this call, Mr. Michael explained\nthat, as outlined in its 2021 investor day presentation and as demonstrated by its operating performance in\nthe first quarter, SPX FLOW had a plan to drive value creation for its stockholders and, therefore, any\nproposal to acquire the Company should reflect the value of such opportunity. Mr. Reynal responded by\nindicating that Ingersoll Rand was prepared to send a letter formally expressing its interest in exploring a\ntransaction with SPX FLOW.\nThereafter, at Mr. Michael's direction, a special meeting of the Board was scheduled for June 1, 2021, in\norder to further consider the overtures made by Ingersoll Rand.\nOn May 27, 2021, Mr. Michael received an email from Mr. Reynal, which included a letter from Ingersoll\nRand (the \u201cMay 27 IR Proposal\u201d). The May 27 IR Proposal set forth a valuation for SPX FLOW of $81.50 per\nshare in an all cash transaction. The May 27 IR Proposal was a non-binding expression of interest and\nindicated that Ingersoll Rand would need four to five weeks to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive\ndocumentation.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on May 27, 2021, Mr. Michael discussed the May 27 IR Proposal with Messrs. Hull and Ryan and the\nplan to include it on the agenda for the special meeting of the Board already scheduled for June 1, 2021.\nThereafter, Mr. Ryan discussed the May 27 IR Proposal with Winston, including potential responses to the\nproposal and the Board's obligations with respect to the proposal.\nOn May 28, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Ryan held a telephone call with representatives of Morgan Stanley\nin order to discuss the May 27 IR Proposal and potential responses by SPX FLOW.\nOn June 1, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was convened in order to consider and discuss the May 27\nIR Proposal. At this meeting, Mr. Ryan led the Board in a review of materials related to corporate governance\n(including that management not engage in discussions with any potential acquiror concerning post-closing\ncompensation or equity arrangements until expressly permitted by the Board) and the fiduciary duties of\ndirectors in the context of an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The Board then discussed the May 27 IR\nProposal in the context of the value that could be delivered to the stockholders of SPX FLOW by continued\nexecution of the strategic plan and related initiatives already underway. The Board also reviewed and\ndiscussed projections provided by SPX FLOW management and the preliminary valuation views prepared by\nMorgan Stanley based on such projections. These projections included the Management Case-Long Range\nPlan (as defined below), which reflect the Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.0% by\n2025. Based on these discussions, the Board determined that the May 27 IR Proposal undervalued SPX\nFLOW and its growth prospects. Accordingly, the Board determined that the May 27 IR Proposal should be\nrejected. In addition, at this special meeting the Board reviewed and approved resolutions authorizing the\nformation of a strategic alternatives committee of the Board comprised of Messrs. Hull, Campbell and Singer\n(with Mr. Singer serving as the chair) to facilitate review of strategic alternatives, including a potential\ntransaction with Ingersoll Rand (such committee, the \u201cCommittee\u201d).\nOn June 2, 2022, consistent with the directive from the Board, Mr. Michael sent a response letter to Mr.\nReynal indicating that the Board had unanimously concluded that the valuation contemplated by the May 27\nIR Proposal undervalued SPX FLOW and its future prospects.\nOn June 10, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Reynal agreed to speak on the morning of June 11, 2021.\nLater on June 10, 2021, Ingersoll Rand sent SPX FLOW a second letter relating to a non-binding indication\nof interest in a potential transaction (the \u201cJune 10 IR Proposal\u201d). The June 10 IR Proposal contemplated a\nvaluation for SPX FLOW at $85.00 per share in an all cash transaction. The June 10 IR Proposal also\nprovided high-level background on Ingersoll Rand's valuation approach, indicating that from Ingersoll Rand's\nperspective its offer provided SPX FLOW with full credit for the business plan outlined in its investor day\npresentation and assumed that SPX FLOW could achieve the near and medium term objectives described in\nthat plan.\nAlso on June 10, 2021, Mr. Michael provided the June 10 IR Proposal to each of Messrs. Hull, Ryan and\nJaime Easley, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of SPX FLOW.\nOn June 11, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Reynal spoke on the telephone to discuss the June 10 IR Proposal.\nDuring this call, Messrs. Michael and Reynal discussed the valuation contemplated by the June 10 IR\nProposal and Mr. Reynal explained the assumptions underlying such valuation. Mr. Michael indicated that\nSPX FLOW would carefully review the June 10 IR Proposal and respond on a timely basis.\nAlso on June 11, 2021, Mr. Michael apprised each of Messrs. Hull, Easley and Ryan of his conversation with\nMr. Reynal. Thereafter, Messrs. Michael, Easley and Ryan also discussed the June 10 IR Proposal with\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, who provided input on the process for any potential engagement with\nIngersoll Rand. Mr. Ryan also discussed with Winston the June 10 IR Proposal and the potential responses\nto the updated proposal. Following these discussions, Mr. Michael requested a meeting of the Committee\nbe scheduled for June 13, 2021 in order to provide the Committee with an opportunity to review and discuss\nthe June 10 IR Proposal.\nThe Committee met on June 13, 2021. This meeting was also attended by Messrs. Michael, Easley and\nRyan. At this meeting, the Committee reviewed and discussed the June 10 IR Proposal. Discussion then\nturned to the input and advice received by SPX FLOW from representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston\nin respect of the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand. The Committee discussed the key elements of\nSPX FLOW's valuation, assuming the continued execution of its strategic plan based on management's\nprojections, and also discussed potential interest in SPX FLOW from other third parties. The Committee\nalso discussed the potential benefits and detriments of further engagement with Ingersoll Rand. Following\nsuch discussion, the Committee directed Mr. Michael to convey to Mr. Reynal that SPX FLOW rejected the\nJune 10 IR Proposal.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 14, 2021, Mr. Michael had a telephone conversation with Mr. Reynal, during which he indicated that\nSPX FLOW believed that the June 10 IR Proposal undervalued SPX FLOW. Mr. Michael indicated that if\nIngersoll Rand desired to receive non-public information on SPX FLOW's strategic initiatives and\nopportunities, Ingersoll Rand would need to provide an offer with a higher valuation than that contemplated by\nthe June 10 IR Proposal. In response, Mr. Reynal agreed to review the terms of the June 10 IR Proposal\nfurther with his executive team and advisors and indicated that he would speak again soon with Mr. Michael.\nOn June 15, 2021, Mr. Reynal sent Mr. Michael an email indicating that, following further internal\nconversation, Ingersoll Rand's proposed valuation remained at $85.00 per share. Mr. Reynal also indicated\nthat, while he understood SPX FLOW's belief in its long-term plan, such plan involved a number of execution\nrisks and uncertainties. Mr. Reynal's email further indicated that Ingersoll Rand would not be in a position to\nincrease its offer any further unless non-public information provided under a non-disclosure agreement\nindicated that SPX FLOW was materially ahead of plan and demonstrated an ability to drive more value than\nthat contemplated by the investor day presentation.\nAlso on June 15, 2021, Mr. Michael discussed Mr. Reynal's email with Messrs. Ryan and Easley.\nThereafter, Mr. Ryan provided Winston with a status update on the process and discussed appropriate next\nsteps. Following those discussions, Mr. Ryan provided an email update to the Committee.\nOn June 18, 2021, Mr. Michael advised Mr. Reynal in a brief telephone call that SPX FLOW would provide a\nresponse to the June 10 IR Proposal the following week. Later on the same day, Mr. Michael provided the\nCommittee with another written status update. He also shared with the Committee a draft response letter to\nthe June 10 IR Proposal and Mr. Reynal's email on June 15, 2021. The Committee reviewed the proposed\ndraft response letter and the Committee confirmed agreement with the approach.\nOn the same day, Mr. Michael sent to Mr. Reynal a response letter to the June 10 IR Proposal and Mr.\nReynal's email on June 15, 2021. This response letter was substantially in the form previously agreed to by\nthe Committee. The response letter stated that the Company believed that the June 10 IR Proposal\nundervalued SPX FLOW. The response letter also indicated that, in light of the valuation gap between the\nparties, the Company was not willing to provide confidential information about SPX FLOW.\nOn June 25, 2021, Mr. Michael provided a written update to the Board detailing deliberations of the\nCommittee, discussions with advisors and the current status of interactions with Ingersoll Rand.\nOn July 17, 2021, SPX FLOW received a request for comment from The Wall Street Journal related to a\nstory the newspaper planned to publish relating to Ingersoll Rand's interest in SPX FLOW. Thereafter, Mr.\nMichael discussed the request for comment with Messrs. Hull, Easley and Ryan. Mr. Ryan also contacted\nWinston and discussed the Company's legal obligations in responding to this inquiry. Following these\ndiscussions, SPX FLOW advised The Wall Street Journal that, as a matter of policy, the Company did not\ncomment on rumors and market speculation. Mr. Michael also provided the Board with a written update,\nadvising them of The Wall Street Journal's request for comment and the likelihood that a story would be\npublished with respect to Ingersoll Rand's interest in SPX FLOW.\nOn July 18, 2021, The Wall Street Journal published a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources,\nIngersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW and that the most recent all-cash offer valued SPX\nFLOW \u201cin the low $80's per share.\u201d\nOn July 19, 2021, Ingersoll Rand issued a press release confirming that it had made an all-cash non-binding\nproposal to acquire SPX FLOW for $85 per share and the SPX FLOW Board had rejected the proposal. The\nrelease also stated that Ingersoll Rand \u201cremain(s) committed to engaging with SPX FLOW\u201d and that SPX\nFLOW is a \u201cstrong strategic fit\u201d with Ingersoll Rand. Finally, the release noted that there can be no\nassurance that its proposal will result in a definitive agreement or that the proposed transaction or any other\ntransaction will be approved or consummated.\nAlso on July 19, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Easley received unsolicited telephone calls from several\nstockholders regarding Ingersoll Rand's press release that, as a general matter, were supportive of the\nCompany pursuing a transaction at the valuation proposed by Ingersoll Rand.\nOn the same day, Mr. Ryan also updated the Board and the Committee and solicited input on a potential\npress release to respond to Ingersoll Rand's public statement.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing the close of trading on July 19, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release confirming that the\nCompany had rejected an unsolicited, conditional, non-binding proposal from Ingersoll Rand at $85.00 per\nshare. The press release noted that the Board and management team were open to all avenues to deliver\nstockholder value and remained focused on sustained and profitable growth.\nThe Committee met on the morning of July 20, 2021. The Committee discussed the public statement by\nIngersoll Rand confirming its proposal and the unsolicited feedback from stockholders of SPX FLOW. The\nCommittee then discussed and considered, among other things, the communication strategy for the\nearnings call scheduled for August 4, 2021, the possibility of initiating a formal outreach to potential\nacquirors following such earnings call and the potential for additional unsolicited offers to be made to acquire\nthe Company. The Committee also directed Mr. Ryan to provide a written summary update for the full Board.\nLater in the day, the chief executive officer of a publicly listed company (\u201cStrategic Party 1\u201d) sent Mr.\nMichael an unsolicited message stating that he had been watching the news and indicating receptivity to\ndiscussions with SPX FLOW regarding any strategic alternatives. Mr. Michael provided this message to Mr.\nRyan and discussed an appropriate response with him. Mr. Ryan then provided an email update to\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston on the unsolicited message and proposed response.\nThereafter, Mr. Michael sent a reply message to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 1 indicating\nappreciation for the outreach and that he would be in touch following the Company's earnings call.\nOn July 22, 2021, a long-time stockholder that indicated it beneficially owned approximately 4% of the\nCompany's stock, delivered an unsolicited letter to the Board. The purpose of the letter was to state\nunequivocally that the stockholder would vote in favor of any offer for SPX FLOW at or above $85 and its\nbelief that such a price fully reflected the value of SPX FLOW as a stand-alone company. The letter also\nstrongly urged the Board to maximize stockholder value by publicly announcing, and immediately starting, a\nformal process that included both good faith negotiations with Ingersoll Rand and a demonstration of\nwillingness to engage with other potential acquirors. The letter also indicated that the stockholder intended\nto make the contents of its letter public by July 28, 2021, if the Company did not publicly announce a\nprocess prior to such time.\nThe Committee met again on the morning of July 24, 2021, in order to discuss, among other things, the\npublic disclosure of Ingersoll Rand's proposal and stockholder feedback, including the stockholder letter\ndated July 22, 2021. At this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley led the Committee in a discussion\nof the potential benefits and challenges associated with formally announcing a review of strategic\nalternatives. This discussion was followed by a review by Winston of the fiduciary duties of the Board\nrelating to a decision to initiate and announce a formal review of strategic alternatives. Following further\ndiscussion on next steps, valuation matters, timing and the upcoming earnings call, the Committee agreed\nto call a meeting of the full Board for the following day and directed Mr. Ryan to send an update to the full\nBoard summarizing the status of the Committee's deliberations.\nThe Board met on the morning of July 25, 2021. At the meeting, Mr. Michael provided an overview of the\npress reports relating to the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand, Ingersoll Rand's public confirmation\nof such proposals, the communication strategy in response thereto, feedback from stockholders of SPX\nFLOW and the deliberations of the Committee with respect to the timing and announcement of a potential\nreview of strategic alternatives (including a possible sale transaction or a determination to continue to\nexecute on SPX FLOW's strategic plan). Thereafter, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Board\nwith their insights related to the then current circumstances, including market and investor reaction to the\ndisclosures of the unsolicited proposals from Ingersoll Rand. Following this discussion by Morgan Stanley,\nthe Board reviewed the potential benefits and challenges of initiating a formal review of a strategic review\n(including a possible sale transaction or a determination to continue to execute on SPX FLOW's strategic\nplan) and related public announcement. The Board also discussed valuation, how best to create a\ncompetitive process designed to maximize stockholder value and the manner in which Ingersoll Rand would\nbe engaged in, and may respond to, a competitive process. Winston then provided an overview on the\nBoard's fiduciary duties. Following further discussion by the Board, the Board determined, based on a\nvariety of factors (including input from stockholders of SPX FLOW, market response and unsolicited interest\nfrom another potential strategic acquiror) to initiate a formal review of strategic alternatives (including a\npossible sale transaction or a determination to continue to execute on SPX FLOW's strategic plan) and to\nmake prompt public disclosure of such decision.\nOn July 26, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release announcing a review of strategic alternatives, including\na possible sale or merger of SPX FLOW or the continued execution of SPX FLOW's standalone strategy,\nincluding its strategic plan.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder the direction of the Board, between the public announcement of the strategic review process on July\n26, 2021 and the announcement of the signing of the Merger Agreement on December 13, 2021,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley sought to engage 23 potential strategic parties (including Ingersoll Rand)\nand eight financial parties (including Lone Star) in the exploration of a potential acquisition of SPX FLOW.\nDuring the course of the strategic review process, eight strategic parties and seven financial parties\n(including Lone Star) ultimately signed a non-disclosure agreement. Ingersoll Rand was provided a form of\nthe non-disclosure agreement, but did not execute, or provide comments to, the form of non-disclosure\nagreement.\nThese non-disclosure agreements were all based on the same form non-disclosure agreement and all but\none non-disclosure agreement executed by SPX FLOW included a standstill provision. Each non-disclosure\nagreement that was entered into by SPX FLOW with a standstill provision contained exceptions to the\nprovision, including that private, non-public discussions and proposals to the Board or the officers of SPX\nFLOW were expressly permitted. The non-disclosure agreement without a standstill provision was entered\ninto with Strategic Party 1.\nThroughout the month of August, SPX FLOW and its advisors engaged in intensive work on the confidential\npresentation materials and sell-side due diligence efforts (including the population of a virtual data room).\nOn August 16, 2021, Mr. Ryan placed a phone call and sent an email to the general counsel of Ingersoll\nRand regarding Ingersoll Rand's potential interest in participating in the strategic review process, but\nreceived no immediate response to either communication.\nOn August 18, 2021 and August 19, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting via\nvideoconference. This Board meeting included an update from representatives of Morgan Stanley on the\nstatus of the strategic review process, including the various parties that expressed interest and those parties\nthat declined to participate in the strategic review process and an illustrative timeline for the strategic review\nprocess.\nOn August 24, 2021, Mr. Michael invited Mr. Reynal to a lunch meeting.\nOn August 25, 2021, Mr. Reynal told Mr. Michael that Ingersoll Rand was still evaluating next steps with its\nboard of directors. Mr. Reynal noted that he expected to have an update by August 31 and that he would\nreach-out at that time. Mr. Michael suggested an in-person meeting, but did not receive a response from Mr.\nReynal.\nBetween August 26, 2021 and August 31, 2021, management continued to work with the Company's\nadvisors to finalize key documents for the strategic review process, including the management presentation\nand process letter. Drafts of the management presentation were also provided to the Board and to the\nCommittee. In addition, Mr. Michael provided the Committee with a written update regarding prospective\npurchasers interested in participating in the strategic review process.\nOn August 31, 2021, at the direction of the Committee, Morgan Stanley delivered a process letter to\nprospective acquirors then participating in the strategic review process. This process letter requested that an\ninitial indication of interest be delivered by the end of September, which was in advance of the Board's next\nscheduled meeting. The prospective acquirors were requested to provide, among other things, a proposed\nvaluation for SPX FLOW on a price per share basis, the assumptions underlying such valuation and the form\nof merger consideration to be delivered. In addition, the process letter requested that bidders identify\nproposed financing sources and the time required to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive\nagreements. The process letter indicated that, following the submissions of the indications of interest, a\nlimited number of parties would be selected to move on to the second stage of the transaction process (at\nwhich time additional guidance would be provided to prospective acquirors).\nOn September 1, 2021, management of SPX FLOW delivered its first management presentation to a\nprospective acquiror in connection with the strategic review process. During the course of the strategic\nreview process, six parties (including two strategic parties and four financial parties) engaged in virtual or in-\nperson meetings with the SPX FLOW management team.\nAlso on September 1, 2021, Ingersoll Rand issued a press release stating that Ingersoll Rand would not\nparticipate in SPX FLOW's strategic review process. Mr. Reynal wrote Mr. Michael contemporaneously with\nthe issuance of the press release and provided the same message. Mr. Michael responded by indicating\nthat SPX FLOW remained available to engage with Ingersoll Rand if Ingersoll Rand decided to reengage.\nThereafter, Mr. Ryan provided the Board with a written update summarizing the Ingersoll press release and\nthe communications between Messrs. Reynal and Michael.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 3, 2021, a virtual data room was opened to prospective acquirors. During the course of the\nstrategic review process, six parties (including one strategic party and five financial parties) were provided\naccess to the virtual data room.\nOn September 9, 2021, while SPX FLOW management continued to meet with prospective acquirors,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley received a verbal indication from Strategic Party 1 regarding potential\ninterest in an alternative to a sale of SPX FLOW, whereby Strategic Party 1 would contribute certain\nbusiness divisions into SPX FLOW in exchange for stock in SPX FLOW. The assets proposed to be\ncontributed were non-core to SPX FLOW and inconsistent with the Company's strategic plan. Strategic\nParty 1 did not ultimately provide a formal indication of interest with respect to the above described proposal\nor an acquisition of SPX FLOW.\nOn September 11, 2021, the Committee met. During this meeting, the Committee discussed, among other\nthings, the announcement by Ingersoll Rand that it would not participate in the strategic review process and\nthe status of ongoing meetings with prospective acquirors (including the verbal indication of interest from\nStrategic Party 1). In addition, the Committee also discussed the agenda for the regularly scheduled Board\nmeetings at the end of September, including SPX FLOW's strategic plan, valuation and matters related to\nthe strategic review process.\nOn September 21, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board a relationship disclosure\nmemo.\nOn September 27, 2021, a private equity fund (\u201cFinancial Party 1\u201d) submitted a non-binding indication of\ninterest that valued SPX FLOW at between $85.00 and $87.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. Key\nassumptions underlying this indication of interest included: (i) that the historical and 2021E EBITDA provided\nfor review of the prospective acquirors reflected the maintainable GAAP earnings base of the business, and\n(ii) management's forecast for 2021 and 2022 was achievable. The indication of interest from Financial Party\n1 did not include any information on its plans or proposals for management compensation arrangements.\nFinancial Party 1's indication of interest did not indicate how long it would need in order to complete due\ndiligence on, and reach a definitive agreement with, SPX FLOW.\nOn September 28, 2021, Lone Star submitted a non-binding indication of interest that valued SPX FLOW at\n$85.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Key assumptions underlying this indication of interest included:\n(i) 2021 outlook and performance, including an assumption of adjusted 2021 run-rate EBITDA being in\nexcess of $310 million (excluding public company costs and non-cash corporate expenses), and (ii)\nconfirmation of the Company's ability to execute against the longer term strategic plan. The indication of\ninterest from Lone Star did not include any information on its plans or proposals for management\ncompensation arrangements. Lone Star's indication of interest did not indicate how long it would need in\norder to complete due diligence on, and reach a definitive agreement with, SPX FLOW.\nOn September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. These\nmeetings included discussions of, among other things, the status of the strategic review process. In\nparticular, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the status of the strategic review process, including\nthe status of discussions with prospective acquirors and a review of the preliminary valuation analysis with\nrespect to various strategic alternatives. Mr. Easley presented on the Management Case-Long Range Plan\nand valuation of the Company. Thereafter, Winston reviewed, among other things, the fiduciary duties of the\nBoard in connection with the strategic review process.\nAlso on September 29, 2021, SPX FLOW learned that a strategic party (\u201cStrategic Party 2\u201d) had determined\nto withdraw from the process following review of the potential transaction with its board of directors.\nNo strategic parties remained involved in the strategic review process following the withdrawal of Strategic\nParty 2. Other than Financial Party 1 and Lone Star, no other party submitted an indication of interest.\nFollowing submissions of the indications of interest by Financial Party 1 and Lone Star, each of Financial\nParty 1 and Lone Star were directed to continue their due diligence efforts and provide an update to their\nindication of interest in advance of the Board's next scheduled meeting on November 1, 2021. Morgan\nStanley requested that the updated proposal focus on valuation, sources and uses (including detailed\ninformation on the status of discussions with debt financing sources), remaining diligence and work-streams\nand time required to reach a signed transaction.\nOn October 12, 2021, SPX FLOW hosted in-person meetings with representatives of Lone Star in the\nCompany's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Representatives from SPX FLOW in\nattendance at this meeting included Messrs. Michael, Easley, Ryan and Tyrone Jeffers, Vice President,\nGlobal Manufacturing and Supply Chain for SPX FLOW along with representatives from Morgan Stanley. The\nmeeting agenda included a review of the history of the SPX FLOW business, market dynamics and trends,\ngo-to-market model and strategy, and 2021 and multi-year operational expectations.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn the same day and following the in-person October 12, 2021 meeting, Messrs. Michael and Easley and\nrepresentatives from Lone Star attended a dinner meeting together along with representatives from Morgan\nStanley. During this dinner the group discussed their personal experiences relative to business as well as\nLone Star's experience as an owner of operating companies.\nOn October 20, 2021 and October 21, 2021, representatives from Lone Star conducted site visits to SPX\nFLOW's Rockford, IL and Delavan, WI facilities. Representatives in attendance at these site visits from SPX\nFLOW included Messrs. Michael and Jeffers along with representatives from Morgan Stanley. During the site\nvisits, the parties also discussed Lone Star's observations regarding SPX FLOW's end markets, key product\nlines and operating structure.\nOn October 22, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board an updated relationship\ndisclosure memo.\nOn October 25, 2021, a letter was delivered to the Board by a stockholder of SPX FLOW. The letter stated,\namong other things, the stockholder's belief that a sale transaction would be in the best interests of SPX\nFLOW and its stockholders. The letter also indicated the stockholder's belief that management's long-term\nvision and plan for SPX FLOW, as articulated at the investor day presentation, were viewed by the\ninvestment community as aggressive and subject to significant execution risk, the result of which was that\nmarket participants were applying significant risk-weighted adjustments to management's forecasts. The\nletter stated that such doubt held within the investment community would continue to limit the potential for\nvalue creation on a standalone basis.\nOn the same day, Mr. Ryan provided the Committee with a written summary and copy of the stockholder\nletter.\nOn October 27, 2021, Financial Party 1 indicated that it would not submit an updated bid and would be\nwithdrawing from the process.\nOn October 28, 2021, Lone Star submitted an updated proposal reaffirming its interest in acquiring SPX\nFLOW in an all cash transaction that valued SPX FLOW at $85.00 per share. Lone Star's updated proposal\nindicated that threshold commercial, business and industry diligence was completed and that remaining\ndiligence would be focused on: (i) the near-term free cash flow profile and liquidity of SPX FLOW, and (ii)\ncompletion of customary confirmatory diligence (and the issuance of due diligence reports) by third party\nadvisors. Lone Star's proposal included a detailed sources and uses for the proposed transaction, which did\nnot contemplate any rollover by management (and no other terms were otherwise provided in the updated\nproposal regarding Lone Star's plans with respect to management). The proposal concluded with a\nstatement that Lone Star was confident in its ability to complete due diligence and negotiate definitive\nagreements within a period of 30 days.\nOn the same day, Messrs. Michael, Easley and Ryan met with representatives of Morgan Stanley in order\nto review the updated proposal submitted by Lone Star, the withdrawal from the process by Financial Party\n1, the stockholder letter received October 25, 2021 and potential next steps with respect to the strategic\nreview process.\nOn October 29, 2021, the Committee met in order to, among other things, review the status of the strategic\nreview process and to discuss the stockholder letter received on October 25, 2021. At the meeting, the\nCommittee engaged in a detailed review of Lone Star's diligence efforts to date, the updated proposal\nsubmitted by Lone Star on October 28, 2021 and valuation analysis of the Company. Following these\ndiscussions, the Committee determined to proceed with a final stage of due diligence and engagement with\nLone Star, with the objective of finalizing terms for the Board's consideration prior to its regularly scheduled\nmeeting in December. In addition, the Committee then considered the possibility of having Mr. Michael reach\nout to Strategic Party 2 to discuss its potential interest in re-engaging in the process.\nOn November 1, 2021, the Board met in order to, among other things, review the status of the strategic\nreview process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the status of Lone Star's engagement with\nthe sale process and provided an overview of Lone Star's updated proposal. The representatives of Morgan\nStanley also provided a preliminary analysis of the Lone Star proposal from a valuation perspective, including\na review of the proposal based on comparable transactions. The Board also reviewed and discussed\nprojections provided by SPX FLOW management and the valuation views prepared by Morgan Stanley based\non such projections. These projections included (i) the Management Case-Long Range Plan, and (ii) the\nManagement Case-Adjusted, which was developed by management at the direction of the Board in order to\nreflect cost saving and other initiatives only to the extent already substantially implemented and reflected\nthe Company achieving a target Adjusted EBITDA margin of only 22.0% by 2025. Winston then provided an\noverview on the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering Lone Star's updated\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproposal. The Board then discussed next steps in connection with Lone Star's updated indication of interest\nand the timeline required in order to obtain an actionable binding offer.\nOn November 5, 2021, Winston provided a draft of the Merger Agreement to Lone Star's counsel, Gibson,\nDunn & Crutcher LLP (\u201cGibson\u201d).\nOn November 11, 2021, Messrs. Michael and Ryan met with representatives of Morgan Stanley following\nSPX FLOW's earnings call for its third quarter. This meeting included a discussion on feedback received\nfrom stockholders. In addition, the participants on the call considered the merits of reaching out to Strategic\nParty 2 to discuss potential interest in re-engaging in the process. Following this discussion, it was\ndetermined that Mr. Michael would reach out to the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 in order to\ndetermine whether Strategic Party 2 was interested in re-engaging.\nOver the course of November 18, 2021 and November 19, 2021, representatives of Lone Star and\nrepresentatives of SPX FLOW management participated in due diligence sessions held in person at the\nCompany's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina and held dinner meetings. Representatives of\nMorgan Stanley were also present at these due diligence sessions and dinner meetings.\nOn November 23, 2021, Mr. Michael spoke with the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2. The chief\nexecutive officer of Strategic Party 2 indicated that he did not believe there was any change in its position,\nbut he would follow-up with Mr. Michael.\nAlso on November 23, 2021, Gibson provided Winston with a detailed markup on the draft Merger\nAgreement. These comments included, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nThe addition of a requirement that SPX FLOW cooperate in good faith and use commercially\nreasonable efforts to repatriate cash, as requested by Lone Star, to the United States from any\nforeign jurisdiction in as tax- and cost-efficient a manner as reasonably practicable, with a view to\nmaximizing the amount of SPX FLOW's cash held in the United States (and including a cap on the\namount of cash permitted to be held in the People's Republic of China as of the closing date)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe addition of a marketing period for the debt financing that would not commence until closing\nconditions are satisfied (other than those that can only be satisfied at closing), the Required\nInformation (as defined therein) has been delivered and 20 business days (without counting\nblackout periods) have elapsed\u037e\n\u2022\nThe removal of the requirement for Lone Star to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment\nLetter in the event of a breach by the lenders\u037e\n\u2022\nThe addition of a prohibition on the Company paying dividends to its stockholders after signing of\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nThe proposed treatment of all outstanding performance-based restricted stock units to vest at the\ntarget level of performance set forth in each award agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nAn increase of the company termination fee from 2% to 4% of the equity value of the transaction\nand the addition of a requirement that such fee be payable (a) upon termination of the Merger\nAgreement by Lone Star following a change of recommendation by the Board or (b) in the event\nthat the stockholder vote fails to pass following such a change of recommendation\u037e\n\u2022\nAn additional termination fee payable by SPX FLOW equal to 1% of the equity value of the\ntransaction in the event that SPX FLOW failed to secure stockholder approval for the transaction\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nA reduction of the termination fee payable by buyer from 10% to 4% of the equity value of the\ntransaction and the addition of language providing that such buyer termination fee would be the\nsole and exclusive monetary remedy in the event of a debt financing failure or any other breach\nunder the Merger Agreement.\nAlso on November 23, 2021, there was an increase in buying activity in the stock of SPX FLOW that\nappeared to coincide with inaccurate reports relating to the strategic review process undertaken by the\nCompany, including inaccurate reports that the Company had received offers as part of its process that\nvalued the Company at $97 per share of SPX FLOW common stock. Following discussions with\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston, SPX FLOW management provided the Committee with a\nwritten update on such activity. The Committee, after reviewing the update provided by SPX FLOW\nmanagement, determined that, consistent with the Company's established policy, SPX FLOW should not\nrespond to the reports.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 24, 2021, SPX FLOW management provided a written update to the Board on the\nunsubstantiated takeover rumors.\nOn November 29, 2021, Winston and Gibson met by videoconference to review open issues related to\nGibson's markup of the Merger Agreement. Winston focused its feedback on key issues, including the\nmarketing period for Lone Star's debt financing, the requirement for Lone Star to enforce its rights under the\nDebt Commitment Letter, the Company's ability to continue paying dividends to its stockholders after the\nsigning of the Merger Agreement, amounts and triggers for each party's terminations fees, the treatment of\nthe outstanding performance-based restricted stock units and the repatriation of foreign cash.\nOn November 30, 2021, the Committee met. At this meeting, Mr. Michael provided the Committee with an\nupdate on the status of the strategic review process. Thereafter, the Committee engaged in discussion on\nthe key issues currently under negotiation with Lone Star and key workstreams required to be completed in\nadvance of the Committee's upcoming meeting on December 7, 2021 and the Board's meeting on December\n8.\nOn December 1, 2021, Gibson sent Winston a draft of Lone Star\u2019s Debt Commitment Letter that was\ncontemplated by the proposed Merger Agreement. This Debt Commitment Letter was provided by\ncreditworthy lending institutions and was assessed to be on customary terms and conditions for a\ntransaction of this kind.\nAlso on December 1, 2021, Winston sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Gibson. Over the\ncourse of the next week, in advance of the scheduled meetings of the Committee and the Board, Winston\nand Gibson met by videoconference on a number of occasions and exchanged three further drafts of the\nMerger Agreement, with negotiations focusing on the key areas highlighted on the November 29, 2021\nvideoconference call between Winston and Gibson.\nIn addition, on December 4, 2021, Gibson provided Winston with initial drafts of the Equity Commitment\nLetter and Limited Guarantee contemplated by the proposed Merger Agreement with Lone Star. In advance\nof the scheduled meetings of the Committee and the Board, Winston and Gibson exchanged two further\ndrafts of these documents.\nOn December 7, 2021, Lone Star submitted an updated proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of\ncommon stock of SPX FLOW for cash consideration of $85 per share. At the time Lone Star submitted its\nupdated proposal on December 7, 2021, the following material open issues remained unresolved in the\nMerger Agreement:\n\u2022\nWhether or not Lone Star would be expressly required to enforce its rights under the Debt\nCommitment Letter in the event of a breach by the lenders\u037e\n\u2022\nWhether or not the Company would be entitled to continue paying dividends to its stockholders\nafter signing of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nThe vesting treatment of the outstanding performance-based restricted stock units\u037e\n\u2022\nThe amount of the company termination fee, with Lone Star proposing 3.25% and the Company\nproposing 2.75%, in each case of the equity value of the transaction\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe requirement that the Company reimburse buyer's expenses of up to $10 million in the event\nthat the Company failed to secure stockholder approval for the transaction.\nAt 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the same day, the Committee convened to review the proposal from Lone\nStar. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Committee with a review of the updated proposal and\npreliminary valuation analysis related thereto. The Committee then engaged in discussion with respect to\nthe updated proposal. The discussion focused on, among other things, the potential impact on the market\nprice for SPX FLOW common stock in the event it was announced that SPX FLOW would terminate the\nstrategic review process and continue the pursuit of its strategic plan on a standalone basis. The Committee\nalso discussed the possible stockholder reaction to such an announcement. Winston then summarized the\nterms of the Merger Agreement and the key open issues remaining in the Merger Agreement.\nAlso on December 7, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Board with an updated\nrelationship disclosure memo.\nOn December 8, 2021, the Board convened a regularly scheduled meeting, which included a review and\ndiscussion of the updated proposal from Lone Star. During the meeting, Mr. Singer led the Board in a\ncomprehensive update regarding the status of the proposed transaction. The Board discussed the history of\nthe strategic review process, insights related to valuation derived from the process and the deliberations of\nthe Committee related to potential\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnext steps. The Board discussed the price offered by Lone Star, SPX FLOW's strategic plan and prospects\non a standalone basis and unsolicited feedback provided by the Company's stockholders on the strategic\nreview process. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley led a discussion on the preliminary\nvaluation of SPX FLOW. Next, Winston summarized the key legal terms contemplated by the latest Lone\nStar bid and the fiduciary duties of the Board in connection with its consideration of the updated proposal.\nFollowing these deliberations, the Board determined to make a counter-offer to Lone Star.\nDuring the evening of December 8, 2021, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley\npresented Lone Star with a counteroffer of $88 per share.\nOn December 9, 2021, Lone Star responded that it was willing to increase its offer to $86.50 per share and\nsignaled a willingness to resolve other open contractual issues in a reasonable manner.\nLater on the same day, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Board, discussed with representatives of\nLone Star whether it could increase its price further. Lone Star, however, indicated that the $86.50 counter-\noffer was its best and final offer. Mr. Ryan reviewed this counter-offer with Mr. Singer, who then conducted\none-on-one telephone calls with each of the directors during the evening of December 9, 2021 and the\nmorning of December 10, 2021.\nOn the morning of December 10, 2021, Mr. Michael and the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 had a\ntelephone conversation in which the chief executive officer of Strategic Party 2 indicated that Strategic Party\n2 was not interested in reengaging in the strategic review process.\nAlso, on the morning of December 10, 2021, after Mr. Singer had completed his discussions with the\ndirectors, Mr. Singer advised Mr. Ryan that the Company and its advisors should work to finalize all\nremaining issues in the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents, with a view to submitting\nthem for formal Board approval on December 12, 2021.\nBetween December 10, 2021 and December 12, 2021, Winston and Gibson engaged in extensive\nvideoconferences and telephonic meetings in order to review and discuss the remaining open issues in the\nMerger Agreement and other transaction documents. Over these same days Winston and Gibson\nexchanged seven drafts of the Merger Agreement along with several drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter\nand Limited Guarantee. The terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee were agreed to\non December 11, 2021, with the Merger Agreement reaching executable form on December 12, 2021.\nAt 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on December 12, 2021, the Board convened a special meeting via\nvideoconference with representatives of Morgan Stanley and Winston in attendance. Representatives of\nMorgan Stanley reviewed with the Board certain financial analyses. Winston provided an overview of the\nBoard's fiduciary duties in the context of a change of control and the terms of the Merger Agreement, the\nDebt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee. The Morgan Stanley\nrepresentatives then rendered Morgan Stanley's oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing,\nto the Board that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan\nStanley as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of\nSPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such\nholders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock. Following discussion, the Board unanimously determined\nthat the transaction proposed by Lone Star was fair to, and in the best interests of, SPX FLOW and its\nstockholders, unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and authorized SPX FLOW to enter into the\nMerger Agreement and related transaction documents. In addition, the treatment of equity incentive awards\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement were considered and approved by the Compensation & Human\nCapital Management Committee of the Board.\nIn the early evening of December 12, 2021, the parties executed the Merger Agreement and related\ntransaction documents. On the morning of December 13, 2021, SPX FLOW issued a press release\nannouncing the transaction.",

In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,\namendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Buyer will obtain\nfinancing required to consummate the Merger and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any\nmaterial respect from the draft furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection\nwith the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for\nthe proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Morgan\nStanley noted that it is not a legal, tax, or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and\nrelied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, and\nregulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, and regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion\nwith respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company's officers,\ndirectors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Per Share Price to be received by the\nholders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock in the Merger.

Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the relative\nmerits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to other business or\nfinancial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor did it address the underlying business\ndecision of the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement or proceed with any other transaction\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial,\neconomic, market and other\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, the date of delivery of\nits opinion. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the assumptions used\nin preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection\nwith its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion dated December 12, 2021. The following\nsummary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley's opinion or the financial analyses performed and\nfactors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at\nits opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered,\nwithout considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process\nunderlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the\ntables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market\ndata, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 10, 2021, the last trading day prior to the\ndate of the meeting of the Board at which Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion. Capitalization\ninformation for SPX FLOW, including fully diluted number of shares, was provided on December 12, 2021 by\nSPX FLOW management to Morgan Stanley, and were approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan\nStanley's use in its financial analyses.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used\nand relied upon the following financial projections: (i) the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial\nInformation, as more fully described above under \u201cCertain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation,\u201d (ii) the Public Guidance Forecasted Financial Information, as more fully described above under\n\u201cCertain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, (iii) the Management Case-Adjusted, as\nmore fully described above under \u201cCertain SPX FLOW Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, and (iv)\nthe Management Case-Long Range Plan, as more fully described above under \u201cCertain SPX FLOW\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d, which were approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan\nStanley's use in connection with its financial analyses.\nHistorical Trading Range Analysis\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading range of shares of SPX FLOW common stock for the 52-\nweek period ending December 10, 2021 and noted that, during such period, the maximum stock price for\nshares of SPX FLOW common stock was $88.55 (maximum closing trading price was $87.15), which was\nalso an all-time high as of December 10, 2021, the minimum stock price for shares of SPX FLOW common\nstock was $52.30 (minimum closing trading price was $52.97), and the unaffected all-time maximum stock\nprice for shares of SPX FLOW common stock prior to The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting\nthat, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW, was $71.62\n(and unaffected all-time maximum closing trading price was $70.60). Morgan Stanley also noted that the\nclosing trading price for shares of SPX FLOW common stock on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to\nThe Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had\nmade takeover bids for SPX FLOW, was $62.09.\nEquity Research Analyst Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the undiscounted unaffected price targets for shares of SPX common stock\nprepared and published by equity research analysts that had been published by Bloomberg as of July 16,\n2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to\nunnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for SPX FLOW. These targets generally reflect\neach analyst's estimate of the future public market trading price of shares of SPX FLOW common stock. In\norder to better compare the equity research analysts' stock price targets with the Per Share Price, based on\nits professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst's price target to present\nvalue assuming a cost of equity of 9.3%. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst unaffected price\ntarget range for SPX FLOW common stock of $61.00 to $82.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nMorgan Stanley also reviewed the undiscounted current price targets for shares of SPX common stock\nprepared and published by equity research analysts that had been published by Bloomberg as of December\n10, 2021. In order to\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbetter compare the equity research analysts' stock price targets with the Per Share Price, based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley discounted each analyst's price target to present\nvalue assuming a cost of equity of 9.3%. This analysis resulted in a discounted analyst current price target\nrange for SPX FLOW common stock of $69.00 to $99.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nMorgan Stanley compared these ranges to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to\nthe closing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior\nto The Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand\nhad made takeover bids for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63 on December 10, 2021.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect\ncurrent market trading prices for SPX FLOW common stock and these estimates are subject to\nuncertainties, including the future financial performance of SPX FLOW and future financial market\nconditions.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which is designed to provide an implied\nvalue of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed\nand compared certain financial estimates for SPX FLOW with comparable publicly available consensus\nequity analyst research estimates for selected companies that, in Morgan Stanley's professional judgment,\nshare certain similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratios of aggregate value, which Morgan Stanley\ndefined as fully diluted market capitalization plus net debt, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate for\nthe company being analyzed), less investment in associate (as appropriate for the company being\nanalyzed), to EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization\nfor the calendar year 2022, which ratios Morgan Stanley referred to as Aggregate Value/CY2022E EBITDA,\ncalculated with the burden of stock based compensation. Certain of the foregoing terms are used throughout\nthis summary of financial analyses.\nThe below table summarizes the companies, the metrics and the multiples employed in this analysis:\nConsensus\nAggregate\nValue/CY2022E\nEBITDA\nXylem\n24.7x\nIDEX\n22.0x\nGraco\n21.5x\nIngersoll Rand\n20.3x\nAlfa Laval\n16.3x\nDover\n15.4x\nITT\n13.8x\nGEA\n12.0x\nCrane\n9.5x\nSulzer\n8.6x\nBased on its analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected a reference range of\nAggregate Value/CY2022E EBITDA, burdened by stock-based compensation, of 11.0x-15.0x for SPX FLOW.\nMorgan Stanley applied the elected reference range to the adjusted EBITDA set forth in the Street\nConsensus Case, the Management Case-Adjusted, and the Management Case-Long Range Plan.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of\nSPX FLOW common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00):\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nImplied Equity\nValue \nPer Share Range\nStreet Consensus Forecasted Financial Information\n$62-$85\nManagement Case-Adjusted\n$70-$96\nManagement Case-Long Range Plan\n$78-$107\nMorgan Stanley compared these ranges to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to\nthe closing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior\nto The Wall Street\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJournal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover\nbids for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63 on December 10, 2021.\nNo company used in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or directly\ncomparable in business mix, size or other metrics. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing\nanalysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences between SPX\nFLOW and the companies being compared and other factors that would affect the value of the companies to\nwhich SPX FLOW is being compared. In selecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous\njudgments and assumptions with respect to size, business mix, industry performance, general business,\nregulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the\ncontrol of SPX FLOW. These include, among other things, selected company growth and profitability, the\nimpact of competition on the business of SPX FLOW or the industry generally, industry growth, and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the\nindustry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of\nusing selected company data.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on SPX FLOW, which is designed to provide an\nimplied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal\nvalue of such company. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share\nequity values for SPX FLOW.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows that SPX FLOW\nwas forecasted to generate from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025 on a\nstandalone basis. Morgan Stanley performed this analysis on the estimated future cash flows contained in\nthe Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information, the Public Guidance Forecasted Financial\nInformation, the Management Case-Adjusted and the Management Case-Long Range Plan.\nFor purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as adjusted EBITDA (burdened by\nstock based compensation) less depreciation and amortization, plus minority interest, to arrive at operating\nincome, less taxes (assuming a 25.0% of cash tax rate for the projection period per SPX FLOW\nmanagement guidance to reflect tax assets and incentives and assuming 28.0% of tax rate in the terminal\nyear to reflect normalized level of tax rate), to arrive at net operating profit after tax, plus depreciation and\namortization, less increases in net working capital, less cash restructuring expenses, less capital\nexpenditures, adjusted for any net proceeds from asset sales or expenditure on asset purchases. These\nestimated unlevered free cash flows were reviewed and approved by SPX FLOW management for Morgan\nStanley's use.\nMorgan Stanley calculated terminal values for SPX FLOW by applying a range of terminal growth rates of\n2.0% to 3.0%, based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment, to the unlevered free cash flows of SPX\nFLOW through 2025. Morgan Stanley then discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to\npresent value as of September 30, 2021, using a range of discount rates from 7.7% to 9.5%, which were\nselected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of\nSPX FLOW common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00):\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nImplied Equity\nValue \nPer Share Range\nStreet Consensus Forecasted Financial Information\n$62-$97\nPublic Guidance Forecasted Financial Information\n$62-$99\nManagement Case-Adjusted\n$73-$114\nManagement Case-Long Range Plan\n$82-$127\nMorgan Stanley compared this range to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to the\nclosing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to\nnews reports speculating about Ingersoll Rand's offer for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63\non December 10, 2021.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the\npotential future equity value of a company as a function of the company's estimated future earnings. The\nresulting equity value\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwas subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value for such company's\npotential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied\npresent equity values per share on a standalone basis for SPX FLOW.\nTo calculate the discounted equity value for SPX FLOW, Morgan Stanley used estimated Aggregate\nValue/NTM EBITDA based on (i) the Street Consensus Forecasted Financial Information, (ii) the Public\nGuidance Forecasted Financial Information, (iii) the Management Case-Adjusted, and (iv) the Management\nCase-Long Range Plan. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience after\nreviewing and comparing certain financial estimates for SPX FLOW, Morgan Stanley applied a range of\nAggregate Value/NTM EBITDA multiples of 11.0x to 14.0x to these NTM estimates as of year-end 2022,\nwhich range was selected based upon Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and experience taking into\naccount SPX FLOW's and its peers' historical long-term trading multiples, and discounted the resulting\nequity values to September 30, 2021 at a discount rate of 9.3%, which rate was selected based on the\nestimated cost of equity for SPX FLOW.\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the below ranges of implied equity value per share of\nCompany common stock on a fully diluted basis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00). Morgan\nStanley also derived the below implied equity value per share of Company common stock on a fully diluted\nbasis utilizing SPX FLOW's average Aggregate Value/NTM EBITDA multiple of 10.1x since the completion of\nthe Spin-Off on September 26, 2015 until July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street Journal\npublishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover bids for\nSPX FLOW, in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nAggregate Value/NTM EBITDA\nImplied Equity Value Per\nShare \nRange (Selected Multiple\nRange \nof 11.0x to 14.0x)\nImplied Equity Value\nPer \nShare (SPX FLOW\nHistoric \nAverage Trading\nMultiple of \n10.1x)\nStreet Consensus Forecasted Financial Information\n$74-$93\n$68\nPublic Guidance Forecasted Financial Information\n$77-$99\n$71\nManagement Case-Adjusted\n$81-$102\n$74\nManagement Case-Long Range Plan\n$89-$113\n$82\nMorgan Stanley compared this range to the Per Share Price of SPX FLOW common stock in cash, to the\nclosing trading price of SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to\nThe Wall Street Journal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had\nmade takeover bids for SPX FLOW, and the closing trading price of $85.63 on December 10, 2021.\nOther Factors\nMorgan Stanley observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analyses\nwith respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the\nfollowing:\nPrecedent Transactions Analysis\nFor informational purposes, Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed\nto imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial terms of selected transactions. Morgan\nStanley selected, based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and knowledge of the sector, certain\nflow control related sector transactions since 2011 for which relevant financial information was publicly\navailable.\nFor these transactions, Morgan Stanley reviewed the purchase price paid and calculated the ratio of the\naggregate value of each transaction to the estimated last twelve months EBITDA (burdened by stock-based\ncompensation where such information was available), which we refer to as LTM EBITDA, based on publicly\navailable financial information. Morgan Stanley reviewed the transactions in connection with this analysis\nand determined the high, median and low multiples for such selected transactions as 18.9x, 12.0x and 8.3x,\nrespectively.\nThe selected precedent transactions varied significantly based upon company scale, business risks, growth\nprospects and geography, as well as prevailing market trends. Based on its experience and professional\njudgment and taking into consideration, among other things, (i) the observed multiples for the precedent\ntransactions listed above, (ii) the different business, financial and operating characteristics of the companies\nin such transactions as compared to the Company and (iii) the prevailing market trends for the valuation and\nperformance companies in the Company's industry at the time of each transaction as compared to the\ncurrent prevailing market trends, Morgan Stanley applied Aggregate Value/LTM EBITDA multiple range of\n11.0x to 15.0x to the Company's estimated EBITDA for 2021 of $226 million based on the Management\nCase-Long Range Plan.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBased on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied fully diluted share prices for shares of\nSPX FLOW common stock of $56.00 to $77.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nNo company or transaction used in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or the\nMerger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with\nregard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond the control of SPX FLOW, such as the impact of competition on SPX\nFLOW's business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change\nin the financial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.\nPrecedent Premia Analysis\nFor informational purposes, Morgan Stanley also discussed with the Board, based on publicly available\ninformation, the premiums paid in certain U.S. acquisition transactions. The analyses excluded terminated\ntransactions, employee stock ownership plan transactions, self-tenders, spin-offs, share repurchases,\nminority interest transactions, exchange offers, recapitalizations and restructurings, as they were not\nconsidered comparable to the Merger. Morgan Stanley considered premiums paid in announced\ntransactions with a transaction value of approximately $1 billion or more that involved U.S. publicly traded\ntarget companies since 2005. The average premium paid in all such transactions since 2005 was 33%.\nBased on the foregoing, Morgan Stanley applied a premium range of 20% to 40% to the closing trading price\nof SPX FLOW common stock of $62.09 on July 16, 2021, the last trading day prior to The Wall Street\nJournal publishing a story reporting that, according to unnamed sources, Ingersoll Rand had made takeover\nbids for SPX FLOW. Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied fully diluted\nshare prices for SPX FLOW common stock of $75.00 to $87.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.\nNo company or transaction used in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to SPX FLOW or the\nmerger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with\nregard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond the control of SPX, such as the impact of competition on SPX FLOW's\nbusiness or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the\nfinancial condition or prospects of SPX FLOW or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to\nthe most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the\nparticular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary\ndescription. Morgan Stanley arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken and\nassessed as a whole, and it did not ascribe a specific range of values to SPX FLOW common stock or\ndraw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to, and did not attribute any particular weight to, any one\nfactor or method of analysis, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of\neach analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the\ncontext of the circumstances of the particular transaction. In addition, in rendering its opinion, Morgan\nStanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors\nand may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the\nranges of implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be\nMorgan Stanley's view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made\nnumerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions\nand other matters. Many of these assumptions are beyond the control of SPX FLOW. Any estimates\ncontained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of SPX FLOW common\nstock and in connection with the delivery of its written opinion, dated December 12, 2021, to the Board.\nThese analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of SPX FLOW\ncommon stock might actually trade.\nThe Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was determined through arm's-length negotiations between SPX FLOW and Buyer, rather\nthan by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board. The Company's decision to enter into the\nMerger Agreement was solely that of the Board. As described in the section entitled \u201cReasons for the\nMerger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u201d\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbeginning on page 34, Morgan Stanley's analyses were only one of the factors considered by the Board in\nits evaluation of the Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or\nmanagement with respect to the Merger or the Per Share Price.\nMorgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with its customary practice. No limitations were imposed by the Board upon\nMorgan Stanley with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.\nMorgan Stanley did not recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to us or that any specific\namount or form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nThe Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation,\nits knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company's industry, and its knowledge and\nunderstanding of SPX FLOW's business and affairs. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm\nengaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its\nsecurities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,\ncommodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing\nand financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest\non a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may\ntrade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their\ncustomers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Buyer, Buyer's affiliates, SPX FLOW, or any other\ncompany, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative\ninstrument.\nAs compensation for Morgan Stanley's services relating to its engagement, the Company has agreed to pay\nMorgan Stanley a total fee of approximately $34 million, approximately $9 million of which became payable\nupon the rendering of its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent upon the completion of the\nMerger. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses including,\nwithout limitation, professional and legal fees and disbursements, plus any sales, use or other taxes related\nto such fees and disbursements, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. In addition, SPX FLOW\nhas agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and\nemployees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain\nliabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out\nof Morgan Stanley's engagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley's opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates (i) have\nprovided financial advisory services to SPX FLOW for which Morgan Stanley or its affiliates has received, in\nthe aggregate, compensation of less than $1 million, and (ii) have provided financing services to Lone Star\nand majority controlled affiliates and portfolio companies thereof for which Morgan Stanley or its affiliates\nhas received, in the aggregate, compensation of between $5 million and $10 million, and Morgan Stanley or\nits affiliates are also currently engaged by a majority controlled affiliate of Lone Star to provide financing\nservices thereto for which Morgan Stanley would expect to receive fees for any such services under certain\ncircumstances. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing\nservices to the Company and Lone Star and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to\nreceive fees for the rendering of any such services.",

These\narrangements do not include a \u201cgross-up\u201d for any golden parachute excise tax imposed on the executive\nofficer pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Rather, if amounts payable under such arrangements would be\nsubject to an excise tax under the provisions of Code Section 4999, the payments will be reduced to an\namount equal to the greatest dollar amount that would not subject the executive officer to the imposition of\nthe excise tax, unless the executive officer would be placed in a better after-tax position receiving all\npayments and paying the excise tax (the \u201cBest Pay Cutback Provision\u201d).

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are\ngenerally applicable to stockholders of SPX FLOW. The following discussion is based upon the Code, the\nTreasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and existing administrative rulings and court decisions,\neach as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities are subject to change, possibly\nwith retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. Any change could affect the validity of the following\ndiscussion. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) will not challenge one\nor more of the tax considerations described herein. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any\nruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following\nsummary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a\ncourt will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.\nThis discussion is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that\nmay be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any aspects of\nU.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the alternative minimum tax or any aspects of the tax on \u201cnet\ninvestment income\u201d imposed under\n54TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection 1411 of the Code. This discussion also does not address any special tax rules applicable to\nparticular stockholders such as stockholders that are financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S\ncorporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (or an investor in such entities or arrangements), insurance companies, dealers\nin securities or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, regulated\ninvestment companies, real estate investment trusts, stockholders who acquired their shares of SPX FLOW\ncommon stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory stock options or otherwise in connection with the\nperformance of services, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S.\ndollar, U.S. expatriates, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, any person who\nreceives consideration other than cash in the Merger (or any transaction related thereto), retirement plans or\nother tax-deferred accounts, and stockholders who hold their shares of SPX FLOW common stock as part\nof a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction. The following\ndiscussion does not address tax consequences to the persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse\ntax. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of SPX FLOW common stock as capital\nassets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and does not\naddress the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who demand appraisal rights under Delaware\nlaw. In addition, the following discussion does not address non-income tax consequences or the tax\nconsequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the Merger (whether\nor not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the Merger).\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of SPX FLOW common\nstock that is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or an entity\ntreated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of\nthe United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise treated as such for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation\nregardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the\nUnited States and all of the substantial decisions of which one or more \u201cUnited States persons\u201d (as defined\nin Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control, or (b) that has a valid election in effect\nunder the applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a \u201cUnited States person\u201d under the Code.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is any beneficial owner of shares of SPX FLOW\ncommon stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership or another entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes is the owner of shares of SPX FLOW common stock, the tax treatment of the partner or owner in\nsuch partnership or other entity or arrangement will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the\nactivities of the partnership or other entity or arrangement. Accordingly, partnerships and other pass-through\nentities that hold shares of SPX FLOW common stock and partners or owners of such partnerships or other\nentities, as applicable, should consult their own respective tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of\nthe Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW ARE INCLUDED FOR\nGENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW AS OF THE\nDATE HEREOF. EACH HOLDER OF SHARES OF SPX FLOW COMMON STOCK IS URGED TO\nCONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nTO SUCH HOLDER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND\nNON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS.\nU.S. Holders\nIn General\nThe Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the\nsurrendered shares of SPX FLOW common stock. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of SPX\nFLOW common stock is generally the amount paid for such shares of SPX FLOW common stock (less the\namount of any distribution received by such holder treated as a tax-free return of capital). If a U.S. Holder\nacquired different blocks of shares of SPX FLOW common stock at different times or at different prices,\nsuch U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss separately for each block of shares of SPX FLOW common\nstock exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss,\nand any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period\nfor the shares of SPX FLOW common stock is greater than one year as of the closing. A\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreduced rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nCash consideration received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup withholding\nand information reporting. Backup withholding generally will apply only if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number (\u201cTIN\u201d) or otherwise fails to comply with applicable backup withholding\nrules and certification requirements. Corporations are generally exempt from backup withholding. Each U.S.\nHolder should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 (or substitute or successor form) included with the letter\nof transmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that such number is correct and that such U.S. Holder is\nnot subject to backup withholding. If a U.S. Holder fails to provide the correct TIN or certification, payments\nreceived may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a 24% rate. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Amounts so withheld can be credited against such U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability\nand may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the\nIRS.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nIn General\nSubject to the discussion below in \u201c-Backup Withholding and Information Reporting\u201d, a Non-U.S. Holder will\ngenerally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized upon such Non-U.S.\nHolder's exchange of shares of SPX FLOW common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement unless (i)\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days during the\ntaxable year of such disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if an applicable income tax treaty\nso provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S.\nHolder in the United States), or (iii) such Non-U.S. Holder's shares of SPX FLOW common stock constitute\na \u201cU.S. real property interest\u201d under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as amended,\nwhich will, in general, be the case if, at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the\nMerger or the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period for its shares of SPX FLOW common stock, SPX FLOW was\na \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d and such holder held (actually or constructively) more\nthan 5% of the shares of SPX FLOW common stock.\nIf a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder who is an individual and has been present in the United States for 183 or\nmore days during the taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are satisfied, such holder will\nbe subject to a 30% tax (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty) on the gain recognized in the Merger\n(which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses).\nIf a holder is a Non-U.S. Holder and any gain recognized in the Merger is effectively connected with a U.S.\ntrade or business (and, in the case of certain tax treaties, is attributable to a permanent establishment or\nfixed base within the United States), then the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed in the same manner\nas a U.S. Holder. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to an additional\n\u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty\nbetween the U.S. and such Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence.\nSPX FLOW believes that it is not, and will not be as of the effective date of the Merger, a \u201cU.S. real property\nholding corporation.\u201d However, there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge that determination. In\nthe event that the IRS were to successfully assert that SPX FLOW is a U.S. real property holding\ncorporation, then any gain recognized on the sale of SPX FLOW's stock by a Non-U.S. Holder who or that\nheld (actually or constructively pursuant to applicable stock ownership attribution rules) more than 5% of\nSPX FLOW's common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for its shares of SPX FLOW common stock would be treated as\neffectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and would therefore be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to an individual or a corporation\n(depending on the Non-U.S. Holder's status). Each Non-U.S. Holders should consult its individual tax\nadvisors with respect to these rules and the application of these rules to such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s particular\ncircumstances.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nA Non-U.S. Holder is generally not subject to backup withholding and information reporting as described\nabove under \u201c-U.S. Holders-Backup Withholding and Information Reporting,\u201d provided such Non-U.S. Holder\nproperly certifies\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nits non-U.S. status on an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8 BEN-E, or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8\nor otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts so\nwithheld can be credited against such Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may\nentitle such Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the\nIRS.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION\nOF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION,\nTHE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE\nCONTINGENT ON, A STOCKHOLDER'S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF\nSTOCKHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY\nNON-INCOME TAX OR ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.\nACCORDINGLY, EACH STOCKHOLDER IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH SUCH\nSTOCKHOLDER'S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE MERGER TO SUCH STOCKHOLDER.",

If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee and\nyou wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker, trust or the other\nnominee.\nUnder Section 262, a holder of shares of common stock who (1) does not vote in favor of the Merger\nProposal\u037e (2) continuously is the record holder of such shares from the date of the making of the demand\nthrough the effective date of the Merger\u037e and (3) otherwise follows the procedures set forth in Section 262\nmay be entitled to have its shares of common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to\nreceive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, on\nthe amount determined to be fair value, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares of common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, the\nsame as or less than the Per Share Price the stockholders are otherwise entitled to receive under the\nMerger Agreement.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of\nstockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its\nstockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of\nSection 262. This proxy statement constitutes notice to holders of the common stock that appraisal rights\nare available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy\nstatement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex C\ncarefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a\ntimely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A holder of common\nstock who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price described in\nthe Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to\nseek appraisal of shares of common stock, the Company encourages a stockholder considering exercising\nsuch rights to seek the advice of legal counsel.\nA stockholder wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of its shares of common stock must do ALL\nof the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to SPX FLOW a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the\nMerger Proposal at the Special Meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of\nsuch demand\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock from the date of making the\ndemand through the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the\nstockholder transfers the shares before the effective date of the Merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\na stockholder of record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly\ndemanded appraisal or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock within 120\ndays after the effective date of the Merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any\nsuch petition and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the stockholder's obligation to\ninitiate all necessary action to perfect his, her or its appraisal rights in respect of his, her or its\nshares of common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.\n83TABLE OF CONTENTS\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nMerger Proposal, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal or not vote their shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to SPX FLOW,\nbefore the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting at which the Merger Proposal will be\nsubmitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares of common\nstock. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the\ndate the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the\neffective date of the Merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will result in the stockholder's loss of appraisal\nrights and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who\nsubmits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to\nvote against or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. Neither voting against the Merger Proposal nor\nabstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written\ndemand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be\nin addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder's failure to make\nthe written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will result in\na loss of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder's name on the date the written demand is made. A demand for appraisal in respect\nof shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably\ninform SPX FLOW of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand\nappraisal of the holder's shares of common stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of common\nstock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand\nmust be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than\none person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of\nall joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record\nowner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the\nrecord owner or owners.\nA STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS ITS SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS, TRUST OR\nOTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT\nWITH ITS BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A\nDEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN\nSHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER,\nTRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW\nPROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nA record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of common stock\nas a nominee for others may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to shares of common\nstock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In\nthat case, the written demand should state the number of shares of common stock as to which appraisal is\nsought. Where no number of shares of common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be\npresumed to cover all shares of common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds\nshares of common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities\ndepository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares much be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record owner.\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: \nSPX FLOW, Inc.\n13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place\nCharlotte, North Carolina 28277 \nAttention: Peter Ryan\nAt any time within 60 days of the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who\nhas demanded appraisal but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a\nnamed party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered\npursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to SPX FLOW a written withdrawal of the demand for\nappraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective\ndate of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If the\nSurviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is\nrequired or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the\nstockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his, her or its shares of common stock\ndetermined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be more than, the same as or less than the\nPer Share Price.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, the surviving corporation will\nnotify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to\nSection 262, and who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, that the Merger has become effective\nand the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, a\nbeneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or any record holder\nof shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under\nSection 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nwith a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares of common stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal.\nThe Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders\nshould not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect\nto the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holder of shares of common stock who\ndesires to have its shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect its appraisal rights in\nrespect of its shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The\nfailure of a holder of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could\nnullify the holder's previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has\ncomplied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon request given in writing,\nto receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted\nin favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which SPX FLOW has\nreceived demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving\nCorporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the\nrequest for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for\nappraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by\na nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or\nrequest from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for\nappraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served\nupon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such\nservice to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as\nto the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders who have demanded\nappraisal and the Surviving Corporation, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who\ndemanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation\nthereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the\ndirection, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.\nIn addition, because the common stock is publicly listed on the NYSE (and we do not expect this to change\nprior to the Merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of\nshares of common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of such\nshares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock or (y) the value\nof the merger consideration in respect of the such total number of shares for which appraisal rights have\nbeen pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nappraise the shares of common stock in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the proceeding, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the common stock as of the effective date of the Merger\nafter taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, by the Surviving Corporation to the stockholders entitled to\nreceive the same, upon surrender by those stockholders of the certificates representing their shares of\ncommon stock or, in the case of holders of uncertificated shares of common stock, forthwith. Unless the\ncourt in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the\nMerger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5%\nover the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the\nperiod between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before\nthe entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in the\npreceding sentence only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued,\nunless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving\nthe value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,\nthe court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value\narising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also\nstated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible\nof proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nA stockholder considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of its shares of common\nstock as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than\nthe consideration it would receive pursuant to the Merger if it did not seek appraisal of its shares and that an\nopinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262. Although SPX FLOW believes that the Per Share Price is fair, no representation is made\nas to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\nstockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or\nlower than, or the same as, the Per Share Price. Neither SPX FLOW nor Buyer anticipate offering more than\nthe Per Share Price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of SPX FLOW and Buyer\nreserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of\n86\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na share of common stock is less than the Per Share Price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then\nthe right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys'\nfees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed\nupon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Each\nstockholder seeking appraisal is responsible for his, her or its attorneys' fees and expert witness expenses,\nalthough, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails\nto perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of\ncommon stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective date of the Merger into the right to\nreceive the Per Share Price. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder's right\nto appraisal if, among other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of\nthe Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder's\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Price in accordance with Section 262 within 60\ndays of the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of SPX FLOW.\nFrom and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be\nentitled to vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of common stock, if\nany, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective date of the Merger. If no petition for an\nappraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the\nMerger or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder\nto an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nhowever, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court. Failure to comply\nstrictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory\nappraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal\nrights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there\nare any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

Each of the Financing\nCommitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties\nthereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms. Other than the Financing Commitments and the\nFee Letter (as defined below), there are no agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the\nFinancing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to affect the conditionality of the Debt\nFinancing or the Equity Financing, and the Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions\nprecedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent at\nthe Closing on the terms therein. Except for the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment\nLetter (the \u201cFee Letter\u201d) (true, accurate and complete copies of which Parent has delivered to the\nCompany prior to the date of this Agreement (subject to customary redaction for fees, \u201cflex\u201d\nprovisions and other economic terms so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely\naffect the aggregate principal amount committed under the Debt Commitment Letter, conditionality,\navailability or termination of the Debt Financing)), there are no other agreements, side letters or\narrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that would be reasonably likely to affect the\namount or availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing. As of the of this Agreement,\nno event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (A) constitute a\ndefault or breach of Parent or Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent, of any other party\nthereto, under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments\u037e (B) make any of the\nassumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any\nmaterial respect\u037e (C) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments not being\nsatisfied\u037e or (D) otherwise result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the\nFinancing not being available. Neither the Investor nor any Debt Financing Source has notified\nParent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or not to\nprovide the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section\n5.2, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it\nwill be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it\nwith respect to the Financing Commitments or that the full amount of the Financing will not be\navailable as of the Closing. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees\nrequired by the Financing Commitments (or the Fee Letter) required to be paid on or prior to the\ndate of this Agreement. None of the Financing Commitments (or the Fee Letter) contains any\ncommitment fee or other fee payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its\nAffiliates. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the debt and equity financing\nrequired to be provided by Parent to pay the aggregate Merger consideration contemplated by\nA-24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthis Agreement (including the payment by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2) and, together with cash\nheld by the Company and its Subsidiaries that is available to pay all costs, fees and expenses\nnecessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Parent expressly\nacknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this\nAgreement and the other agreements contemplated hereunder is not subject to obtaining the\nFinancing (or any other financing) for or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this\nAgreement.\n(f)\u2003Capitalization of Merger Sub.

Merger Sub has not conducted any\nbusiness prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,\nliabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this\nAgreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n(g)\u2003Brokers and Finders.

Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\u2019s obligation to consummate the\nMerger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this\nAgreement, including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payment of all\namounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated\nhereby and payment of all related fees and expenses and (ii) the Company is Solvent immediately prior\nto the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective\nTime and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes\nof this Agreement, the term \u201cSolvent\u201d when used with respect any Person means that, immediately\nfollowing the Effective Time, (i)(A) the fair value of the assets of such Person will exceed the amount of\nall liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of such Person, and (B) the amount of the Present Fair Salable\nValue of its assets will, as of such time, exceed the probable value of all of its debts and liabilities on a\nconsolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and\nmatured, (ii) the Person will not have, as of such time, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the\nbusiness in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the Person will be able to pay its Debts as\nthey become absolute and mature. The term \u201cSolvency\u201d shall have its correlative meaning. For\npurposes of the definition of \u201cSolvent\u201d: (A) \u201cDebt\u201d means liability on a Claim\u037e and (B) \u201cClaim\u201d means any\nright to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,\ncontingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. \u201cPresent\nFair Salable Value\u201d means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Person\n(including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction\nunder present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises.

No transfer is being made and no\nobligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to\nhinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any\nSubsidiary of the Company.\n(i)\u2003Ownership of Company Capital Stock.
