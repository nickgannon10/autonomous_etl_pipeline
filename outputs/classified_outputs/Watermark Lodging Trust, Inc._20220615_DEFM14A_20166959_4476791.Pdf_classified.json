Riverside Plaza, Suite 4200 \nChicago, Illinois 60606 \n(847) 482-8600\nWatermark Lodging Trust, Inc. (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cWLT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was formed as a Maryland\ncorporation and qualified as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. The Company is a self-\nmanaged, publicly owned, non-traded REIT that, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, invests in,\nmanages and seeks to enhance the value of, interests in lodging and lodging-related properties in the United\nStates.\nCWI 2 OP, LP (the \u201cPartnership\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership of the\nCompany. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are held by, and all of its operations are\nconducted through, the Partnership.\nBrookfield Entities \nc/o Brookfield Asset Management Inc. \n250 Vesey Street, 15th Floor \nNew York, New York 10281 \n(212) 417-7000\nRuby I Holdings LLC, Ruby II Holdings LLC, Ruby III Holdings LLC, and Ruby IV Holdings LLC\n(collectively, the \u201cParent Entities\u201d) are affiliates of private real estate funds (collectively, the \u201cSponsors\u201d)\nmanaged by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (\u201cBrookfield\u201d). Each of the Parent Entities was\nformed as a Delaware limited liability company solely for the purpose of acquiring the Company. Each of\nRuby Merger Sub I LLC, a Maryland limited liability company (\u201cMerger Sub I\u201d), and Ruby Merger Sub II LP,\na Delaware limited partnership (\u201cMerger Sub II\u201d), is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Entities and was\nformed solely for purposes of facilitating the Parent Entities\u2019 acquisition of the Company. None of the Parent\nEntities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II has carried on any activities to date, except for activities incidental\nto its formation and activities undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement.\nThe Special Meeting (page 24)\nThe Proposals\nThe special meeting of our stockholders will be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a\nvirtual-only meeting format. To access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. At the special meeting, holders of our Common Stock,\n$0.001 par value per share (the \u201ccommon stock\u201d), including shares classified as Class A Common Stock,\n1 TABLE OF CONTENTS\n$0.001 par value per share (the \u201cClass A common stock\u201d), and shares classified as Class T Common Stock,\n$0.001 par value per share (the \u201cClass T common stock\u201d), will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a\nproposal to approve the merger (the \u201cmerger proposal\u201d), (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding,\nadvisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is\nbased on or otherwise relates to the merger (the \u201cadvisory compensation proposal\u201d), and (3) a proposal to\napprove any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if there are\nnot sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the \u201cadjournment proposal\u201d).\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the\nvirtual special meeting.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14,\n2022, are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or\nadjournment thereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at\nthe special meeting for each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the\nrecord date, there were 229,163,176 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the\nspecial meeting. Holders of our Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share\n(the \u201cSeries B preferred stock\u201d), are entitled to receive notice of the special meeting but are not entitled to\nattend or vote at the special meeting, and no vote or proxy is being solicited from such holders.\nThe presence virtually via the special meeting website or by proxy of the holders of our common stock\nentitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum\nfor purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting.\nAbstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a\nquorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to a later\ndate that is not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to restrictions in the merger\nagreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities\u2019\nwritten consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was\noriginally scheduled).\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of\nour common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal (the\n\u201cstockholder approval\u201d). Because the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes\nthat our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to\nauthorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or\nfail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will have\nthe same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a\ncondition to completion of the merger. For the purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a\nproxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial\nadvisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals,\nassuming a quorum is present. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect\non the outcome of such proposals.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of\napproximately 1,067,169 shares of common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.47% of the voting\npower of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have\ninformed us that they intend to vote the shares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger\nproposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and in favor of the adjournment proposal,\nalthough they have no obligation to do so.\n2 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProxies and Revocation\nAny holder of record of our common stock entitled to vote may authorize a proxy to vote his, her or its\nshares by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card, authorizing a proxy or voting instructions by\ntelephone or through the Internet, or attending the virtual special meeting via the special meeting website\nand voting during the live webcast. If the shares of common stock that you own are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by\nyour broker, you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by\nyour broker.\nAny proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by your delivery of a properly executed, later-\ndated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy by telephone or through the Internet at a later date than the date\nof your previously authorized proxy, by your filing a written revocation of your proxy with our Corporate\nSecretary or by your voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the virtual special meeting alone\nwill not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized proxy.\nThe Merger and the Partnership Merger (page 52)\nPursuant to the merger agreement, at the company merger effective time Merger Sub I will be merged with\nand into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub I will cease, and the Company will continue as\nthe Surviving Company in the merger. On the closing date, the Company and Merger Sub I will cause articles\nof merger to be executed and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. The\nmerger will become effective upon the later of the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State\nDepartment of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland or such other date and time as may be agreed\nbetween the parties to the merger agreement and specified in the articles of merger\u037e provided, however, that\nin no event will the closing of the merger be required to occur prior to the earlier of (i) a date specified by the\nParent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II on no less than three business days\u2019 written notice to the\nCompany and (ii) October 21, 2022. We use the term \u201ccompany merger effective time\u201d in this proxy statement\nto refer to the time that the merger becomes effective and the term \u201cSurviving Company\u201d to refer to the\nsurviving entity in the merger following the company merger effective time.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, at the partnership merger effective time Merger Sub II will be merged with\nand into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership (the \u201cpartnership\nmerger\u201d).The completion of the partnership merger is subject to the same conditions as the completion of the\nmerger and will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of\nDelaware or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed by the applicable parties to the merger\nagreement and specified in the certificate of merger. Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to\nthe \u201cmerger\u201d in this proxy statement, we are referring to both the merger and the partnership merger. We use\nthe term \u201cpartnership merger effective time\u201d in this proxy statement to refer to the time that the partnership\nmerger becomes effective and the term \u201cSurviving Partnership\u201d to refer to the surviving entity in the\npartnership merger following the partnership merger effective time.\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors (page 34)\nOur board of directors has unanimously:\ndetermined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company\nand its stockholders\u037e\nauthorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement\u037e and\ndirected that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of our\ncommon stock at the special meeting.\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\n3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOpinion of Our Financial Advisor (page 37)\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nOn May 5, 2022, at a meeting of our board of directors, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d)\nrendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion,\ndated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope\nof review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, and taking into account the Paid\nBroker Dealer Fees (as defined below), both the per Company A share merger consideration to be received by\nthe holders of Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger consideration to be received by\nthe holders of Class T common stock (in each case, other than the excluded common shares) pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated May 6, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit\nB and hereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other\nthings, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope\nof the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Stockholders are urged to, and should, read the\nopinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion is directed to the Company\u2019s board of directors and\naddresses only the fairness of the per Company A share merger consideration to be received by the holders of the\nCompany\u2019s Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger consideration to be received by the holders of\nthe Company\u2019s Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company\u2019s common stock\nas of the date of the opinion. The summary of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement and its opinion were for the\nbenefit of our board of directors (in its capacity as such), and Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was rendered to our board of\ndirectors in connection with the board\u2019s evaluation of the merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address any other\naspect of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and was not intended to, and does not, constitute a\nrecommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act at the special meeting to be held or\nin connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nTreatment of Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, RSU Awards and Warrants (page 53)\nCommon Stock\nThe merger agreement provides that at the company merger effective time, each share of our common stock\nissued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (other than shares\nowned by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the Company or Merger\nSub I as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (collectively, the \u201cexcluded common\nshares\u201d)) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.768 per share\nfor each share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share for each share of Class T common stock, in\neach case without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (respectively, the \u201cper Company A\nshare merger consideration\u201d and the \u201cper Company T share merger consideration,\u201d and, collectively, the\n\u201ccommon stock merger consideration\u201d). Excluded common shares will be automatically cancelled and retired\nand will cease to exist with no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. If we declare\nor make a distribution on our common stock reasonably necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT\nunder the Code or to avoid the payment of income or excise tax under the Code, in each case as permitted\nunder the merger agreement, the per Company A share merger consideration and/or the per Company T share\nmerger consideration (as applicable) will be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of such\ndistribution.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\nThe merger agreement provides that at the company merger effective time, each share of our Series B\npreferred stock, issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (other\nthan shares owned by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I or any subsidiary of the Parent Entities, the\nCompany\n4 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor Merger Sub I as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time (collectively, the \u201cexcluded\npreferred shares,\u201d and, together with the excluded common shares, the \u201cexcluded shares\u201d)) will be\nautomatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the applicable optional\nredemption price, as determined in accordance with the Articles Supplementary governing the Series B\npreferred stock, less any applicable withholding taxes (the \u201cper Company Series B preferred share merger\nconsideration\u201d). Excluded preferred shares will be automatically cancelled and retired and will cease to exist\nwith no consideration being delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.\nRSU Awards\nThe merger agreement provides that effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each\naward of restricted stock units (whether vested or unvested) granted pursuant to the Company\u2019s 2015 Long-\nTerm Incentive Plan, as amended (an \u201cRSU award\u201d), outstanding as of immediately prior to the company\nmerger effective time will be cancelled, in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock subject to the RSU award immediately prior to the company\nmerger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share merger consideration, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nWarrants\nThe merger agreement requires the Partnership to deliver a \u201ccall notice\u201d to the holders of record of warrants\nto purchase outstanding Class A OP units of the Partnership (the \u201cwarrants\u201d and the \u201cClass A OP units,\u201d\nrespectively), the Class A OP units issued upon exercise of such warrants, and the shares of common stock\nissued upon redemption of such Class A OP units (each, a \u201ccallable security\u201d). Effective as of immediately\nprior to the closing, each callable security held by such holders will be purchased by the Partnership, and at\nor prior to the partnership merger effective time, the Parent Entities will pay (or cause to be paid) to the\nPartnership the aggregate \u201ccall price,\u201d as determined in accordance with the warrant certificate relating\nthereto, for the benefit of such holders.\nTreatment of Partnership Units (page 54)\nThe merger agreement provides that at the partnership merger effective time, each Class A OP unit (other\nthan units held by the Company or any of our wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201ccontinuing\nunits\u201d) and units held by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub II or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent\nEntities or Merger Sub II (collectively, the \u201ccancelled units\u201d), in each case as of immediately prior to the\npartnership merger effective time) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash\nequal to $6.768 per unit, without interest (the \u201cper Partnership unit merger consideration\u201d).\nFinancing (page 44)\nIn connection with the closing of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, the Parent Entities will cause an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion to be paid to the holders\nof common stock, Series B preferred stock, RSU awards, warrants and Class A OP units (other than excluded\nshares).\nIn connection with the merger agreement, the Parent Entities have entered into a commitment letter with\ncertain lenders to obtain debt financing in connection with the mergers. Also in connection with the merger\nagreement, the Sponsors have entered into an equity commitment letter to contribute equity to the Parent\nEntities for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not\ncovered by such debt financing.\nThe Parent Entities have informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds\nto be obtained from the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the\nrefinancing of certain of our existing debt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and\nexpenses related to the financing and the mergers. The Parent Entities have informed us that they currently\nbelieve that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt financing would be secured by, among other\n5 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthings, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned by us, certain escrows and\nreserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in\nthe applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed\nand other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of\nthe mergers. We have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause our\nsubsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to cooperate as may be customary and reasonably\nrequested by the Parent Entities to the extent required in connection with the arrangement of debt financing.\nFor more information, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Certain Other Covenants\u201d and \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Conditions to the Mergers.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 44)\nSome of our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our\nstockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board of directors was\naware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the decision to authorize and\napprove the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nFor more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers\nin the Merger.\u201d\nCompany Acquisition Proposals and Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation (page\n61)\n\u201cNo-Shop\u201d Period\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the date of the merger agreement we have agreed to\ncease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with any person with respect to any\nCompany acquisition proposal and not to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any\ninquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a\nCompany acquisition proposal, and, subject to certain exceptions, we are not permitted to enter into\ndiscussions or negotiations concerning, or provide non-public information to a third party in connection\nwith, any Company acquisition proposals. However, we may, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder\napproval, engage in discussions or negotiations and provide non-public information to a third party that has\nmade an unsolicited written bona fide Company acquisition proposal, if the Company\u2019s board of directors\ndetermines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such\nCompany acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal.\nPrior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, our board of directors may, in certain circumstances,\neffect an adverse recommendation change, subject to complying with specified notice requirements to the\nParent Entities and other conditions set forth in the merger agreement. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Obligations of Our Board of Directors with Respect to Its Recommendation.\u201d\nConditions to the Mergers (page 65)\nCompletion of the mergers

In addition, if a stockholder fails to provide a completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service\n(\u201cIRS\u201d) Form W-9, we or the Parent Entities generally are required to withhold 15% of the merger\nconsideration otherwise payable to such stockholder pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property\nTax Act of 1980 (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d).

These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a\nstockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the\nexhibits and the additional documents to which it refers, including the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to\nthis proxy statement as Exhibit A.\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company and its subsidiaries by affiliates of private real estate\nfunds managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. pursuant to the merger agreement. Once the\nmerger proposal has been approved by the holders of our common stock and the other closing conditions under\nthe merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, at the company merger effective time Merger Sub I will be\nmerged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Company. For additional\ninformation about the merger, please review the full text of the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement\nas Exhibit A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger\nagreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document governing the merger.\nAs a holder of common stock, what will I receive in the merger?\nIf the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $6.768 per share in cash for each share of our Class A\ncommon stock issued and outstanding that you own as of immediately prior to the company merger effective time\nand $6.699 per share in cash for each share of our Class T common stock issued and outstanding that you own as\nof immediately prior to the company merger effective time, in each case without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nWhat will happen to the Company\u2019s Distribution Reinvestment Plan and Share Redemption Plan?\nIn connection with the merger, on May 5, 2022 our board of directors approved the continued suspension of the\nCompany\u2019s distribution reinvestment plan (the \u201cDistribution Reinvestment Plan\u201d) and share redemption plan.\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nIf we obtain the requisite stockholder approval for the merger proposal, and assuming that the other conditions to\nthe merger are satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the merger will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPursuant to the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place on the third business day after\nsatisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the parties\u2019 various obligations to effect the merger (other than those\nconditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or\nwaiver of such conditions at the closing of the merger), or such other date as agreed in writing by the parties to\nthe merger agreement\u037e provided, however, that in no event will the closing of the merger be required to occur prior\nto the earlier of (i) a date specified by the Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II on no less than three\nbusiness days\u2019 written notice to the Company and (ii) October 21, 2022.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nIf the merger proposal is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any\nother reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their common stock pursuant to the merger\nagreement. Instead, we will remain an independent company, our common stock will continue to be registered\nunder the Exchange Act, and our common stock, Series B preferred stock, RSU awards and warrants will remain\noutstanding. Upon a termination of the merger agreement, under certain circumstances we will be required to pay\nthe Parent Entities the Company termination fee or the expense reimbursement payment, and in certain other\ncircumstances the Parent Entities will be required to pay us the Parent termination fee.\n12 Q: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf the merger is completed, how do I obtain the common stock merger consideration for my shares?\nOur stockholders will receive payment in the form of a check to your address of record or paid to alternate\ndistribution instructions if established on the account. If shares are held in a custodial or broker-controlled\naccount, payment will be made to the custodian or broker, as applicable.\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nThe special meeting will be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only meeting format.\nTo access the virtual special meeting, stockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM.\nWho can vote and attend the special meeting?\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022,\nare entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment\nthereof. Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting\nfor each share of common stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were\n229,163,176 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nHow do I attend the virtual special meeting?\nThe special meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time. You will\nnot be able to physically attend the special meeting. To access the virtual special meeting via live webcast,\nstockholders should visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. The virtual special meeting will start\npromptly at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, and online access will begin at 8:45 a.m., Central Time. To log in to the virtual\nspecial meeting, you will be required to enter a control number (included on your proxy card, voting instruction\nform or other notice that you may receive), which will allow you to participate in the virtual special meeting and\nvote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of the record date.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve the merger proposal?\nApproval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a\nmajority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for the merger\nproposal is based on the number of votes that our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the\nnumber of votes cast, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your shares at the virtual special\nmeeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on\nhow to vote, will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve the advisory compensation proposal?\nApproval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on\nthe proposal. For the purpose of this proposal, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your\nshares at the virtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor,\nbank or other nominee on how to vote, will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?\nApproval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.\nFor the purpose of this proposal, failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote your shares at the\nvirtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other\nnominee on how to vote, will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\n13 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhy is my vote important?\nIf you do not authorize your proxy to vote your shares or do not vote your shares at the virtual special meeting, or\nyou do not instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will be more difficult\nfor the Company to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the merger\nproposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority\nof all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal, your failure to authorize your proxy or to vote at the\nvirtual special meeting, or your failure to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to\nvote, will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nHow does the common stock merger consideration compare to our net asset value?\nThe common stock merger consideration represents a premium of more than 7.5% over our most recently published\nestimated net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per share of Class T\ncommon stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nWhy are holders of Class A common stock and holders of Class T common stock receiving different common stock merger\nconsideration?\nThe difference in the common stock merger consideration payable to holders of Class A common stock and Class T\ncommon stock is attributable to the remaining amount of the stockholder servicing and distribution fees\nattributable to the Class T common stock. The prices paid by purchasers of Class T common stock in our initial\nand follow-on public offerings were lower than the purchase prices for Class A common stock because the selling\nand distribution commissions payable in respect of Class T common stock were not paid at the time of the\npurchase\u037e instead, these commissions were payable over time. The continuing commission expenses were\nallocated to the Class T common stock, as described in the prospectuses for our offerings. The Company paid the\ncommissions to the brokers for the holders of Class T common stock on their behalf and recouped such amounts\npaid by paying lower dividends on the Class T common stock over the years. At the time that we stopped paying\ndividends in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, there was a total of approximately $4,198,641 of\nremaining expense allocated to the Class T common stock. That expense accounts for the difference between the\nper Company A share merger consideration and the per Company T share merger consideration and was also\nreflected in our most recently published estimated NAVs of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per\nshare of Class T common stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nAs a holder of Series B preferred stock, what will I receive in the merger?\nIf the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the applicable optional\nredemption price, as determined in accordance with the Company\u2019s Articles Supplementary governing the Series B\npreferred stock, for each share of Series B preferred stock issued and outstanding that you own as of immediately\nprior to the company merger effective time, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nWhat will happen to my restricted stock unit awards in the merger?\nEffective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each RSU award (whether vested or unvested)\noutstanding as of immediately prior the company merger effective time will be cancelled, and in exchange you will\nhave the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to\nthe RSU award immediately prior to the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share\nmerger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n14 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related\ncompensation payable to our named executive officers?\nIn July 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-\nbinding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named\nexecutive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions, such as the merger.\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory compensation proposal?\nThe vote to approve the advisory compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve\nthe merger proposal. Approval of the advisory compensation proposal is a not a condition to completion of the\nmerger. The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on the\nCompany or our board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by\ntheir terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the advisory\ncompensation proposal, if the merger is completed our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the\ncompensation that may be paid or become payable to them that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have any interest in the merger that is different from mine?\nSome of our directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders\ngenerally. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d\nfor information about the interests that our directors and executive officers have in the merger that are different\nfrom yours.\nWhat do I need to do now?\nAfter carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement (including the exhibits),\nplease vote your shares of common stock in one of the ways described in this proxy statement as soon as\npossible. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned as of\nthe record date.\nHow do I cast my vote?\nIf you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you may vote at the virtual special meeting or\nauthorize a proxy to vote your shares at the virtual special meeting. You can authorize your proxy by completing,\nsigning, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope.\nOr, if you prefer, you can authorize your proxy by following the instructions on your proxy card for telephonic or\nInternet proxy authorization: registered stockholders can transmit your voting instructions by telephone by calling\n(800) 690-6903 or through the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. Telephonic and Internet voting are available 24\nhours per day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the day immediately before the date of the special meeting. Have\nyour proxy card with you if you are going to authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. If the\ntelephonic or Internet option is available to you, we strongly encourage you to use it because it is faster and less\ncostly.\n15 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of common stock are held of record in \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nIf you own common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you\nmust provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on your voting instruction form that you may\nreceive from your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, since brokers, financial advisors, banks and\nother nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this\nproxy statement. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such\nvoting instructions, contact your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee who can give you directions on\nhow to vote your shares. If you hold your common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other\nnominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a \u201clegal proxy,\u201d executed in your favor,\nfrom the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nWith respect to the merger proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote at the virtual special meeting\nor by proxy or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, financial\nadvisor, bank or other nominee, it will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. With\nrespect to the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal, if you abstain from voting, fail to\ncast your vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy or if you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give\nvoting instructions to your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, it will not have any effect on the\noutcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nHow will proxy holders vote my shares of common stock?\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the virtual special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted as\nyou direct. If you authorize a proxy but no direction is otherwise made, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the\nmerger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal. Pursuant to\nour bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special\nmeeting.\nWhat happens if I sell my common stock before the special meeting?\nIf you held common stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the merger effective time, you will retain\nyour right to vote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the common stock merger consideration for\nsuch shares. The right to receive the common stock merger consideration when the merger becomes effective will\npass to the person who owns the shares you previously owned.\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nYes. If you own common stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized\nproxy at any time before it is exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly\nauthorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending and voting at the virtual special meeting. Attendance at the\nvirtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously authorized proxy. If you have\ninstructed a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the foregoing options for\nchanging your vote do not apply and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, financial\nadvisor, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\nIs the merger expected to be taxable to me?\nYes. The receipt of the common stock merger consideration for each share of common stock pursuant to the merger\nwill be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nyou will recognize gain or loss as a result of the merger measured by the difference, if any, between the common\nstock merger consideration you receive and your adjusted tax basis in your common stock. In addition, if a\nstockholder fails to provide a completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9, we or the Parent Entities generally are\nrequired to withhold 15% of the common stock merger consideration otherwise payable to such stockholder\npursuant to FIRPTA, and a stockholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-9 or otherwise qualify for an\nexemption may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at a rate of 24% of the common stock merger\nconsideration otherwise payable to such stockholder. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax\n16 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsequences of the merger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will\ndepend on your particular tax situation. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax\nconsequences of the merger to you.\nWhat rights do I have if I oppose the merger?\nIf you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the merger proposal. You are\nnot, however, entitled to exercise any appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder\nto receive the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger because, as permitted by the\nMGCL, our charter provides that stockholders are not entitled to exercise any such rights unless our board of\ndirectors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, determines that the rights apply. Our board of\ndirectors has not made such a determination. See the section entitled \u201cNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal.\u201d\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nWe intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current\nReport on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the\nSEC are publicly available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov when filed.\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the virtual special meeting?\nIf you are unable to attend the virtual special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your\nproxy card, or authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet.\nWhere can I find more information about the Company?\nWe file certain information with the SEC, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on our\nwebsite at www.watermarklodging.com.

You can also request copies of these documents from us. See the\nsection entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nWho will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?\nWe will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be\nsolicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, email or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other\nemployees, for which they will not receive additional compensation.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE SPECIAL MEETING\nDate, Time and Purpose of the Special Meeting\nThis proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of\ndirectors to be exercised at a special meeting to be held on September 9, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, in a virtual-only\nmeeting format. To access the virtual special meeting via live webcast, stockholders should visit\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/WLT2022SM. To log in to the virtual special meeting, you will be required to enter a\ncontrol number (included on your proxy card, voting instruction form or other notice that you may receive), which will\nallow you to participate in the virtual special meeting and vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder as of\nthe record date.\nAt the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to act on the following matters:\nProposal 1:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company\u037e\nProposal 2:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nmerger\u037e and\nProposal 3:\nTo consider and vote on a proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger\nproposal.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special\nmeeting.\nA copy of the merger agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully\nin its entirety.\nRecord Date, Notice and Quorum\nAll holders of record of our common stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 14, 2022, are\nentitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the virtual special meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each\nholder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of\ncommon stock that such holder owned as of the record date. On the record date, there were 229,163,176 shares of our\ncommon stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Holders of our Series B preferred stock are entitled\nto receive notice of the special meeting but are not entitled to attend or vote at the special meeting, and no vote or proxy is\nbeing solicited from such holders.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be\ncast at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special\nmeeting via the special meeting website constitutes presence in person for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A\nquorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the\npurposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the\nspecial meeting will be adjourned to a later date that is not more than 120 days after the original record date (subject to\nrestrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the\nParent Entities\u2019 written consent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was\noriginally scheduled).\nRequired Vote\nCompletion of the merger requires approval of the merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of our common\nstock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the merger proposal. Because the required vote for\nthe merger proposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the\nnumber of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special meeting (including\nby abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, such failure will\nhave the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\n24 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of these proposals is not a condition to completion of the merger. For\nthe purpose of each of these proposals, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special\nmeeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect\non the outcome of such proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the\noutcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nAccordingly, in order for your shares to be voted, if you are a stockholder of record, you must complete and return the\nenclosed proxy card, authorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet, or attend the virtual\nspecial meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.\nAs of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately\n1,067,169 shares of common stock, entitling them to exercise approximately 0.47% of the voting power of our common stock\nentitled to vote at the special meeting. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote the\nshares of common stock that they own in favor of the merger proposal, in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and\nin favor of the adjournment proposal, although they have no obligation to do so.\nVotes cast by proxy or at the virtual special meeting will be counted by the person appointed by us to act as inspector of\nelection for the special meeting. The inspector of election will also determine the number of shares of common stock\nrepresented at the special meeting, virtually or by proxy.\nHow to Authorize a Proxy\nHolders of record of our common stock may vote or cause their shares to be voted by proxy using one of the following\nmethods:\nmark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail\u037e\nauthorize your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or through the Internet by following the instructions\nincluded with your proxy card\u037e or\nattend the virtual special meeting via the special meeting website and vote during the live webcast.\nRegardless of whether you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we request that you authorize a proxy for your shares\nof common stock as described above as promptly as possible.\nA broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee are represented at a\nmeeting, but the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial\nowner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary\nvoting power on other proposals at such meeting. If you own common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or\nother nominee (i.e., in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you must provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions on your\nvoting instruction form that you may receive from your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, since brokers,\nfinancial advisors, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the\nproposals described in this proxy statement. You should instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on\nhow to vote your shares, following the directions contained in your voting instruction form. If you have not received such\nvoting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, financial advisor,\nbank or other nominee who can give you directions on how to vote your shares. If you hold your common stock through a\nbroker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee and wish to vote at the virtual special meeting, you must obtain a \u201clegal\nproxy,\u201d executed in your favor, from the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee (which may take several days).\nBecause the required vote for the merger proposal is based on the number of votes that our common stockholders are\nentitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the\nvirtual special meeting (including by abstaining), or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on\nhow to vote, such failure will have the same effect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal. Because the approval of the\nadvisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes\ncast on such proposal, and because your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary\nauthority to vote on either proposal, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares or to vote at the virtual special\nmeeting, or fail to instruct your broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee on how to vote, it will not have any effect\non the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\n25 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProxies and Revocation\nIf you authorize a proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy. If\nno voting instructions are indicated when you authorize your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted in\naccordance with the recommendations of our board of directors. Our board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nYou may revoke your proxy at any time, but only before the proxy is voted at the virtual special meeting, in any of three\nways:\nby delivering, prior to the date of the special meeting, a written revocation of your proxy dated after the date\nof the proxy that is being revoked to our Corporate Secretary at Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc., 150 N.\nRiverside Plaza, Suite 4200, Chicago, Illinois 60606\u037e\nby delivering to our Corporate Secretary a later-dated, duly executed proxy or by authorizing your proxy by\ntelephone or by Internet at a date after the date of the previously authorized proxy relating to the same shares\nof common stock\u037e or\nby attending and voting at the virtual special meeting.\nAttendance at the virtual special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy. If you own\nshares of common stock through a broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee, you may revoke or change previously\ngranted voting instructions by following the instructions provided by the broker, financial advisor, bank or other nominee\nthat is the registered owner of the shares.\nPursuant to our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the notice of special meeting may be brought before the virtual special\nmeeting.\nSolicitation of Proxies\nWe will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be\nsolicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, email or otherwise, by our directors, officers and other employees, for\nwhich they will not receive additional compensation. We have engaged Broadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies\nfor a fee of approximately $106,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and we have agreed to\nindemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations\nholding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, that are beneficially owned by others, to send (or cause to\nbe sent) proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such holders for their\nreasonable expenses in so doing.\nAdjournments\nOur bylaws permit the chair or co-chair of the special meeting, acting in his or her own discretion and without any action\nby our stockholders, to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the special\nmeeting. In such case, the adjourned meeting may take place without further notice (other than by an announcement made\nat the special meeting) unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original record date or if, after the\nadjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be\ngiven to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of or to vote at the special meeting (subject to restrictions in the\nmerger agreement, including that in certain circumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities\u2019 written\nconsent, be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).\nPostponements\nAt any time prior to convening the special meeting, we may postpone the special meeting for any reason without the\napproval of our common stockholders (subject to restrictions in the merger agreement, including that in certain\ncircumstances the special meeting may not, without the Parent Entities\u2019 written consent, be held on a date that is more than\n30 days after the date on which the special meeting was originally scheduled).\n26 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER\nGeneral Description of the Merger and the Partnership Merger\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, affiliates of private real estate funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield will\nacquire the Company and our subsidiaries, through the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company, with the\nCompany continuing as the Surviving Company, and the merger of Merger Sub II with and into the Partnership, with the\nPartnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership. Our stockholders and the holders of units in the Partnership will\nPartnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership. Our stockholders and the holders of units in the Partnership will\nexchange all of their Class A common stock, Class T common stock, Series B preferred stock and Class A OP units in the\nmerger or the partnership merger, as applicable, for the applicable cash consideration and the Company and our\nsubsidiaries will be owned by the Parent Entities. See the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Treatment of Common\nStock, Series B Preferred Stock, RSU Awards and Warrants\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Treatment of Partnership Units\u201d\nfor more information.\nBackground of the Merger\nAs part of its ongoing oversight, direction and management of the Company, our board of directors and management team\nregularly review and discuss the Company\u2019s performance, business plan, strategic direction and future prospects. In\nparticular, our board of directors and management have been focused for some time on obtaining value for stockholders by\npositioning the Company for a successful liquidity event, given the Company\u2019s status as a non-traded REIT and the fact\nthat, in connection with the initial public offerings of our predecessors, Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (\u201cCWI 1\u201d)\nand Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (\u201cCWI 2\u201d), CWI 1 and CWI 2 expressed their intentions to begin\nconsidering alternatives for providing liquidity for stockholders beginning not later than the sixth anniversary of the\ntermination of their respective initial public offerings, which terminations occurred in 2013 (CWI 1) and 2017 (CWI 2). In\nApril 2020, CWI 2 completed a merger with CWI 1 with a view to improving the combined company\u2019s ability to execute a\nsuccessful liquidity event for stockholders. The merger created a company with greater scale, eliminated joint ventures\nbetween CWI 1 and CWI 2, and made the combined company (renamed Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc.) self-managed, all of\nwhich we believed would increase opportunities for stockholder liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States with full force around the time of the merger between CWI 1 and CWI 2 and\nhad a devastating impact on the travel and lodging industries. Our portfolio of hotels was materially adversely affected by\nthe pandemic. In response, we focused on reducing expenses, complying with safety mandates and engaging with lenders\nand other counterparties to restructure payment obligations. By April 30, 2020, all of our 32 hotels had effectively ceased\noperations, and we suspended dividends and our redemption program.\nAgainst a backdrop of disruption and uncertainty, our board of directors and management team focused on shoring up our\nliquidity and putting the Company on a footing to return to growth and profitability in the future. In July 2020, we drew\n$200 million of new capital through the issuance of Series B preferred stock. As part of the transaction, we agreed to elect\ntwo individuals designated by the holders of our Series B preferred stock to our board of directors. We also pursued asset\nsales strategically to raise additional funds.\nMost of our hotels gradually reopened in the second half of 2020, but the majority of them continued to operate at very low\noccupancy levels into 2021. Our current 25 hotel portfolio Net Operating Income decreased from $198 million in 2019 to a\nloss of $33 million in 2020\u037e and Corporate EBITDA, adjusted for the internalization of management, decreased from $206\nmillion in 2019 to a loss of $54 million in 2020. We cancelled or deferred planned renovations, temporarily suspended\nfunding certain reserves and entered into debt service deferrals on substantially all of our mortgage indebtedness. In\nNovember 2020, we reported that our estimated NAVs per share of Class A common stock and per share of Class T common\nstock were $5.51 and $5.45, respectively, as of September 30, 2020, which represented declines of over 50% from the\npreviously reported estimated NAVs of $11.41 per share of Class A common stock and per share of Class T common stock.\nOur board of directors held a meeting on March 25, 2021, for the purpose of reviewing the Company\u2019s business strategy.\nRepresentatives of the Company\u2019s management and Clifford Chance US LLP (\u201cClifford Chance\u201d), the Company\u2019s outside\ncorporate counsel, were present at the meeting. Management reported that demand from individual consumers was\nimproving at the Company\u2019s resort hotels but that the urban hotels that cater to business travel, and group travel business\nfor all of the hotels, remained moribund. The consensus of our board of directors and management was that due to the\nsevere business downturn attributable to the pandemic, the uncertain outlook for a recovery in the lodging industry and\nthe operating losses that the Company was incurring due to the downturn, it would likely take several years for the\nCompany to\n27 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecover the lost value in its portfolio, resume regular dividends and redemptions, and execute a stock exchange listing\nand/or listed public offering at a reasonable valuation. Our board of directors and management concluded that it would be\nprudent to explore the prospects for a capital raise or other strategic transaction that could enable the Company to make\nprogress on its objectives of returning to growth and profitability in the future and fulfilling our stated intention to provide\nliquidity for stockholders, including possibly a transaction involving the investors that had purchased the Series B\npreferred stock. Over the coming months, members of the Company\u2019s management held informal conversations with\nrepresentatives of investment banking firms and representatives of the Series B preferred stock investors regarding the\nprospects for a potential transaction.\nOur board of directors held a meeting on June 15, 2021. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford\nChance were present at the meeting. At the meeting, management and the directors designated by the Series B preferred\nstock investors provided an update on the preliminary work that the Series B preferred stock investors had undertaken\nregarding a potential strategic transaction with the Company. A representative of Clifford Chance reviewed the directors\u2019\nduties in connection with the consideration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company. Representatives of Morgan\nStanley reviewed a range of strategic alternatives that could be considered by a non-traded REIT to achieve stockholder\nliquidity, including: a stock exchange listing, with or without a concurrent public offering\u037e a cash sale or partial\nrecapitalization\u037e a merger with an existing listed lodging company\u037e and a conversion of the Company to a perpetual open-\nend fund. Our board of directors concluded that management should continue to investigate the various alternatives,\nwhich the board expected to consider alongside the alternative of remaining as an independent, non-traded REIT for the\nforeseeable future.\nOur board of directors held a meeting on September 14, 2021, during which the directors discussed the Company\u2019s\nbusiness strategy. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance participated in the meeting. At\nthis time, all of the Company\u2019s hotels were open, but the majority of them continued to experience significantly reduced\nlevels of occupancy. In particular, the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19 had set back the recovery that the\nCompany had been experiencing at some of our properties. At the meeting, the directors designated by the Series B\npreferred stock investors informed the other directors that the Series B preferred stock investors would not put forth a\nproposal for a strategic transaction with the Company, due to recent volatility in the capital markets and the required return\nthresholds of their capital partners. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the directors potential strategic\nalternatives for the Company. The directors, with input from representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford\nChance, discussed certain considerations with respect to the alternatives, including that: (i) continuing to operate as a\nstandalone public company in an uncertain environment would likely require the Company to sell additional hotels, seek\nfurther debt restructuring and continue the suspension of dividends and redemptions for the foreseeable future\u037e (ii) listed\nhotel company valuations suggested that the trading value of the Company\u2019s common stock in a direct listing or public\noffering would likely be well below the most recent estimated NAVs per share\u037e (iii) a strategic third-party investment could\nassist with reducing the Company\u2019s leverage and providing liquidity for some stockholders but would likely be expensive\nand only an intermediate step that would not generate sufficient proceeds to address liquidity needs in full and provide\ngrowth capital sufficient to add meaningful value\u037e (iv) a sale of the Company for cash would provide near-term liquidity for\nstockholders but would not enable them to participate in a future recovery of the Company\u2019s portfolio\u037e and (v) a strategic\nmerger with an existing listed hotel company would provide near-term liquidity and an opportunity for stockholders to\nparticipate in a future recovery, but the Company\u2019s leverage would likely be a concern to potential merger partners and a\nmerger partner\u2019s ability to execute a sizable transaction would be limited by its cost of capital. The sense of the directors\nwas that in light of the uncertain outlook for the lodging industry, the fact that the Company would likely not resume\npaying dividends or redeeming shares for the next few years if it remained independent, and the expectation that a capital\nraise would be expensive or based on a heavily discounted valuation of the Company, it would be in the best interests of\nstockholders for the Company to focus on strategic alternatives that would provide stockholders with liquidity in the near\nterm. After discussion, the directors concluded that management should undertake additional analysis of the alternatives\nfor both a cash sale and strategic merger.\nOur board of directors continued its discussion of the Company\u2019s business strategy at a meeting on September 28, 2021.\nRepresentatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance participated in the meeting. Management reported on\nrecent business conditions and plans to address the Company\u2019s debt maturities over the coming year. After discussion of\nthese matters and how they may impact the strategic alternatives that had been discussed at the previous meetings, the\ndirectors requested that management develop a proposed timeline and strategy for approaching potentially interested\nparties regarding a sale or other transaction that would result in liquidity for the Company\u2019s stockholders. The directors\nalso authorized the chief executive officer to implement retention arrangements for key employees whose assistance would\nbe needed in connection with any process.\nOn October 20, 2021, our board of directors met to discuss the Company\u2019s business strategy. Representatives of\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed current\n28 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmarket conditions and a proposed process for soliciting indications of interest for a sale or other strategic transaction\ninvolving the Company. Our board of directors discussed certain risks and benefits of commencing a process in which\nparties would be invited to review confidential information and submit indications of interest with respect to a potential\ntransaction involving the Company, including risks related to potential disruptions to our business, loss of key employees\nand the need to disclose proprietary and confidential information to current and potential competitors, and the benefits of\nobtaining near-term liquidity and potential certainty of value for our stockholders. After discussion of the potential risks\nand benefits of a process, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of our stockholders to take\nsteps to further explore a potential sale or other strategic transaction, including establishing a formal process involving\noutreach to a number of potential transaction parties.\nOn November 11, 2021, we executed an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley formally retaining Morgan Stanley as the\nexclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with our board of directors\u2019 evaluation of a possible transaction.\nOur board of directors held meetings on December 8, 2021 and January 13, 2022. At each meeting, representatives of\nmanagement and Morgan Stanley updated the directors on the status of the transaction process. A representative of\nClifford Chance also attended the meetings. Between the beginning of the process in November 2021 and January 13, 2022,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley contacted 41 potential bidders to participate in the process, including family offices,\nsovereign funds and financial sponsors, 10 of which executed a confidentiality agreement with us by that date. Each bidder\nthat signed a confidentiality agreement was given access to an electronic data room containing customary due diligence\ninformation regarding the Company and our properties. The parties that did not enter into a confidentiality agreement\nindicated that they were not interested in pursuing a transaction with us at that time for various reasons, including, among\nothers, concerns regarding the potential size of the transaction, the expected pricing and associated return profile of the\ntransaction, concerns about the recovery prospects of the lodging industry and, for certain investors that are focused on\nspecific segments of the lodging market, the diversity of the portfolio. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed a list of\nadditional parties whom Morgan Stanley intended to contact and a timeline for receiving initial indications of interest from\ninterested bidders.\nOn February 9, 2022, we executed an engagement letter with Hodges Ward Elliott, Inc. to act as our real estate advisor and\nto assist bidders to assess the value of our real property in connection with the transaction process.\nOn February 15, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley distributed to potential bidders an initial bid process letter. The\nletter asked potential bidders to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest by March 14, 2022, for a potential\nacquisition of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and Series B preferred stock. Each potential bidder was\ninformed that the Company\u2019s invitation to participate in a second round of bidding would be based, in our sole discretion,\non a variety of factors, including the potential bidder\u2019s proposed purchase price and an assessment of its ability to\ncomplete the transaction expeditiously with minimal execution risk.\nOn March 16, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss, among other things, the written indications of interest\nthat we received. Members of our management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present.\nThe representatives of Morgan Stanley informed the directors that by that date, a total of approximately 64 investors had\nbeen contacted and invited to participate in the process, 25 of which executed confidentiality agreements with the\nCompany, including Brookfield. The Company received 5 written indications of interest. The Morgan Stanley\nrepresentatives reviewed the initial indications of interest, noting that 4 indications of interest were received from financial\nsponsors at valuations of the Company ranging from approximately $3.2 billion to approximately $3.6 billion (enterprise\nvalue), resulting in prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.54 per share of common stock (including an all-cash proposal from\nBrookfield at a price of $6.54 per share of common stock). The fifth proposal, also from a financial sponsor, was for a\nmanagement-led acquisition of the Company, including the Company\u2019s ownership interest in certain properties. After\ndiscussion, our board of directors determined that while none of the prices indicated was currently acceptable, the\nindications of interest were in a range that could potentially be improved to an acceptable level through negotiation. The\ndirectors authorized a second round of bidding with a select group of bidders, targeting definitive proposals in April 2022.\nFollowing the meeting of our board of directors on March 16, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley conducted\ntelephonic meetings with potential second-round participants. With input from our board of directors and management and\nbased on an assessment of each bidder\u2019s ability to make a compelling offer and complete a merger with minimal execution\nrisk, three potential bidders were invited to participate in a second round of bidding, consisting of Brookfield and two\nadditional financial sponsors (which we refer to as \u201cBidder A\u201d and \u201cBidder B\u201d). Throughout March and April 2022, the\n29 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npotential bidders continued to conduct due diligence on the Company, and 2 additional parties executed confidentiality\nagreements with the Company.\nOn March 28, 2022 we reported that our estimated NAVs as of December 31, 2021, were $6.29 per share of Class A common\nstock and $6.22 per share of Class T common stock.\nOn April 1, 2022, a second-round process letter and draft agreement and plan of merger (\u201cdraft merger agreement\u201d) prepared\nby Clifford Chance were made available in the data room. The initial draft merger agreement contemplated a customary all-\ncash merger. The letter asked each of the bidders to submit definitive proposals by April 20, 2022, to acquire all of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock and Series B preferred stock, which proposals were to include a mark-up of the\ndraft merger agreement, as well as to specify sources of financing, including commitment letters in final form.\nBeginning on April 20, 2022, each of Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B submitted bid letters together with mark-ups of the\ndraft merger agreement and related transaction documents. Brookfield\u2019s mark-up of the draft merger agreement\ncontemplated, among other things, equivalent company and reverse termination payments of $80 million, a requirement to\nreimburse up to $20 million of Brookfield\u2019s expenses if our stockholders did not approve the transaction at a duly convened\nmeeting, and the right of the Company to specifically enforce the merger agreement under certain circumstances.\nOn April 23, 2022, our board of directors met to discuss the potential sale transaction. Representatives of management,\nMorgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the second-\nround proposals received from Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B, including certain financial aspects of the proposals, and\nupdated our board of directors as to the discussions they had with each of the bidders. Representatives of Clifford Chance\nreviewed with our board of directors the proposed terms of the mark-ups of the draft merger agreement with each of the\nbidders, summarized the key execution risks and material open issues associated with each proposal, and suggested areas\nfor further negotiation.\nWith input from representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance, our board of directors continued to\ncompare the merits of the three bids. Our board of directors noted with favor that Brookfield\u2019s all-cash offer of $6.54 per\nshare of common stock was the highest price offered, Brookfield had a proven ability to complete large acquisitions of\npublic companies in the real estate sector, and Brookfield\u2019s transaction documentation was complete and reflected\ncommitted financing. The directors noted certain areas for further improvement in Brookfield\u2019s proposal, including the\namounts of the Company and reverse termination fees and the requirement to reimburse Brookfield for up to $20 million of\nexpenses if our stockholders did not approve the transaction at a duly convened meeting. Our board of directors also\ndiscussed Bidder A\u2019s proposal, which had a lower price of $6.00 per share of common stock but a higher reverse termination\npayment, as well as the Company\u2019s previous positive experience in negotiating and completing transactions with Bidder A.\nAfter discussion of various advantages and disadvantages of the proposals from Brookfield and Bidder A, our board of\ndirectors concluded that each of Brookfield and Bidder A should be requested to consider improving their respective offer\nprices and other key terms and submit a final bid by April 26, 2022, while Bidder B\u2019s offer price was considered to be too\nlow to warrant further negotiation.\nFollowing the April 23 meeting, the Company\u2019s chief executive officer had a discussion with representatives of each of\nBrookfield and Bidder A in which he encouraged each of them to improve its offer price. He also proposed that Brookfield\nreduce its proposed Company termination fee, increase its proposed reverse termination fee and eliminate the requirement\nfor the Company to reimburse up to $20 million of Brookfield\u2019s expenses if the Company\u2019s stockholders did not approve a\ntransaction. Each of Brookfield and Bidder A was instructed to submit a revised proposal by April 26, 2022.\nOn April 26, 2022, Brookfield submitted a revised proposal in which it increased the merger consideration to $6.75 per share\nof common stock and increased the reverse termination fee to either $100 million or, if the Company had no specific\nperformance remedy, $130 million. Brookfield requested a one-week exclusivity period to negotiate the terms of a definitive\nmerger agreement. Bidder A did not submit a revised proposal.\nOn April 28, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss the sale process. Representatives of management,\nMorgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on the second round of\nbidding. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the directors, among other things, the current state of the\ntravel and lodging industry. Representatives of Clifford Chance reviewed the material terms of the final proposals from\nBrookfield and Bidder A. The directors engaged in a discussion of the proposals. Our board of directors concluded that the\noffer price of $6.75 per share of common stock was acceptable, subject to the finalization of other material terms on an\nacceptable basis, and authorized management to enter into a one-week exclusive negotiating period with Brookfield and\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nseek to finalize the terms of a definitive agreement. Our board of directors also authorized management to engage in\ndiscussions with Brookfield with respect to retention and severance arrangements.\nFollowing the April 28 meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley advised Brookfield that the Company was willing to\nenter into a one-week exclusive negotiating period. Representatives of Brookfield confirmed that Brookfield was willing to\nmove forward on that basis. On April 29, 2022, Brookfield and the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement.\nFrom April 29, 2022 to May 6, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP\n(\u201cFried Frank\u201d), counsel to Brookfield, exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nRepresentatives of Clifford Chance and Fried Frank had several calls to resolve open issues on the draft merger agreement\nand, thereafter, continued to exchange further revised drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nDuring that time, the key issues negotiated with Brookfield with respect to the draft merger agreement and related\nagreements included, among other things, the representations and warranties to be made by the parties, the restrictions on\nthe conduct of our business until completion of the transaction, the conditions to completion of the mergers, our ability to\nparticipate in discussions or negotiations with third parties relating to unsolicited acquisition proposals, the outside date\nafter which either party may terminate the merger agreement, the remedies available to the parties, the circumstances in\nwhich expense reimbursement would be payable by the Company, the amounts of the termination payments and expense\nreimbursement, the treatment of employees and implementation of retention and severance arrangements, and a term sheet\nfor a potential advisory agreement requested by Brookfield with Watermark Capital Partners, LLC (\u201cWatermark Capital\nPartners\u201d), which owns a 1.0% capital interest in the Partnership and is 100% owned by Mr. Michael Medzigian, our Chief\nExecutive Officer. In addition, the Company advised Brookfield that its $6.75 per share offer price should be adjusted as\nbetween the Class A common stock and the Class T common stock to account for the remaining amount of the stockholder\nservicing and distribution fees allocated to the Class T common stock (the \u201cPaid Broker Dealer Fees\u201d), resulting in merger\nconsideration of $6.768 per share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share of Class T common stock.\nOn May 5, 2022, our board of directors held a meeting to discuss the final terms of the proposed transaction with\nBrookfield. Representatives of management, Morgan Stanley and Clifford Chance were present. Representatives of Venable\nLLP, special Maryland counsel to the Company, also were present and reviewed with our board of directors the directors\u2019\nduties in connection with a potential sale of the Company. Our board of directors also discussed (1) proposed retention\nand severance arrangements to motivate and retain employees and officers through the closing of the merger and for a\nperiod of time thereafter and (2) the other interests of management in the mergers. Management and the representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Clifford Chance updated our board of directors on the discussions with Brookfield since the last board\nmeeting and described the changes in Brookfield\u2019s offer, noting, among other things, the following: the per share merger\nconsideration was adjusted as between the Class A common stock and Class T common stock, the reverse termination fee\nwas increased from $130 million to $150 million, and the expense reimbursement was reduced from $20 million to $10 million.\nRepresentatives of Clifford Chance also provided a presentation to our board of directors regarding the terms of the merger\nagreement and related transaction documents.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley next reviewed the financial analyses supporting its fairness opinion. After discussion\namong our board of directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed by the delivery of a written opinion, dated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors to the effect that,\nas of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and\nlimitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as described in Morgan Stanley\u2019s written\nopinion, and taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both (a) the merger consideration of $6.768 per share to be\nreceived by holders of the Class A common stock and (b) the merger consideration of $6.699 per share to be received by\nholders of the Class T common stock (other than holders of excluded common shares) pursuant to the merger agreement\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAfter further discussion of the merits of the mergers, and taking into account the various factors described below in greater\ndetail under the section entitled \u201c-Reasons for the Merger,\u201d including our board of directors\u2019 belief that the mergers are\nmore favorable to our stockholders than other strategic transactions available to us, including remaining as an independent\npublic company and listing our common stock, our board of directors voted unanimously to adopt resolutions which,\namong other things, determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,\nauthorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and directed that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common stock of\nthe Company.\n31 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDuring the course of the day on May 6, 2022, the parties finalized the transaction documents and a proposed form of press\nrelease announcing the execution of the merger agreement. Subsequently on May 6, 2022, the Company, the Partnership\nand affiliates of private real estate funds managed by affiliates of Brookfield executed the merger agreement and all\nsignatories to the equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter (and related fee letter) and limited guarantee executed\nsuch agreements.\nIn the afternoon of May 6, 2022, we issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn reaching the unanimous decision to (1) determine and declare that the merger agreement, the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders, (2) authorize and approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, and (3) direct that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common\nstock at the special meeting, our board of directors consulted with members of our management, as well as our financial and\nlegal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material factors which our board of directors\nviewed as supporting its decision:\nwe conducted a thorough and diligent process, inviting approximately 64 potential bidders to participate in\nthe process, of which 27 potential bidders executed confidentiality agreements with the Company in order to\nconduct due diligence, and only Brookfield, Bidder A and Bidder B engaged in significant negotiations with\nus during the 2022 process\u037e\nat the conclusion of the sale process, Brookfield\u2019s offer price was the highest received by the Company\u037e\nour board of directors\u2019 belief that, in light of our thorough and diligent sale process, the feedback we received\nfrom participants in the process regarding their ability to pay sufficiently attractive merger consideration and\nthe definitive proposals submitted by Brookfield and Bidder A, it was unlikely that any other party would be\nwilling to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for common stock merger consideration in excess of\nthe consideration offered to be paid by Brookfield, and that further extending the deadline for proposals or\notherwise soliciting other potential buyers would not yield proposals of greater value or with increased\ncertainty of closing\u037e\nthe merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our stockholders with certainty of value and\nliquidity immediately upon the closing of the merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and longer\npotential timeline for realizing equivalent value from our standalone business plan or other possible strategic\nalternatives such as asset sales or a third-party capital investment\u037e\nthe merger consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations between us and Brookfield, including\nprice increases from the price in Brookfield\u2019s initial indication of interest received on April 20, 2022, of $6.54\nper share of our common stock, and our board of directors\u2019 belief that the merger consideration represented\nthe highest price that Brookfield was willing to pay\u037e\nthe common stock merger consideration represents a premium of more than 7.5% over our most recently\npublished estimated NAVs of $6.29 per share of Class A common stock and $6.22 per share of Class T common\nstock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021\u037e\nour board of directors\u2019 knowledge of our business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, as\nwell as knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which we operate, including uncertainties\nrelating to the resurgence of variants of COVID-19, inflation, predictions of a recession, increasing financing\ncosts, stock market declines, and the fact that interest rates have begun to rise and are expected to continue\nto rise\u037e\nthe risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company and being able to raise new equity\ncapital, reduce leverage, expand our portfolio through acquisitions, and resume paying dividends and\nredeeming shares\u037e\n32 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe belief that the merger is more favorable to our stockholders than other strategic alternatives available to\nus, including remaining as an independent public company and listing our common stock on a national\nsecurities exchange, the feasibility of such alternatives and the significant risks and uncertainties associated\nwith pursuing such alternatives\u037e\nthe high probability that the merger would be completed based on, among other things, Brookfield\u2019s\nsubstantial available capital, proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions and extensive\nexperience in the real estate industry, the lack of a financing condition, and the $150 million Parent termination\nfee payable to us if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, which payment is guaranteed\nby the Sponsors\u037e\nthe terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by our board of directors with our\nfinancial and legal advisors, and the fact that such terms were the product of arm\u2019s-length negotiations\nbetween the parties\u037e\nthe oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to our board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed in\nwriting by the delivery of a written opinion, dated May 6, 2022, to our board of directors, that as of such date\nand based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written\nopinion, and taking into account the Paid Broker Dealer Fees, both the per Company A share merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of Class A common stock and the per Company T share merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of Class T common stock (in each case, other than the excluded\ncommon shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of\nthe Company\u2019s common stock (as more fully described in the section entitled \u201c-Opinion of Our Financial\nAdvisor-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\u201d)\u037e\nour ability under the merger agreement, in response to unsolicited competing proposals, to furnish\ninformation to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain circumstances\u037e\nthe fact that the $50 million Company termination fee payable by us in certain circumstances was viewed by\nour board of directors, after consultation with our financial advisor and our outside legal advisor, as\nreasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a competing proposal\u037e\nour board of directors\u2019 ability, under certain circumstances, to (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify its\nrecommendation that our stockholders approve the merger proposal, subject to payment of the $50 million\nCompany termination fee if the Parent Entities elect to terminate the merger agreement in such circumstance,\nor (ii) terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the\nimplementation of a superior proposal, subject to payment of the $50 million Company termination fee\u037e and\nthe fact that the merger would be subject to the stockholder approval, and holders of our common stock\nwould be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger for any reason, including if a higher offer were\nto be made prior to the special meeting (although we may be required to pay the $50 million Company\ntermination fee under certain circumstances if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement\nrelating to, or to consummate, a competing proposal and we may be required to reimburse Brookfield for up to\n$10 million of expenses).\nOur board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the merger\nagreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:\nour inability to solicit competing proposals and the possibility that the $50 million Company termination fee\npayable upon the termination of the merger agreement could discourage other potential bidders from making a\ncompeting proposal to acquire the Company\u037e\nfollowing the merger, we will no longer exist as an independent public company and our existing stockholders\nwill not participate in any future earnings or growth that we might have achieved on a standalone basis or as\na combined company\u037e\nthe

connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, would be limited to receipt of the $150 million Parent termination fee (the payment of which is\nguaranteed by the Sponsors), other than certain litigation expenses in enforcing our right to the Parent\ntermination fee and certain indemnification and reimbursement rights\u037e\nthe

the merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our\nstockholders generally (see \u201c-Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d).\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by our board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but rather\nincludes the material factors considered by our board of directors. In reaching the unanimous decision to authorize and\napprove the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board of\ndirectors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors\nconsidered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Our board of directors did not\nreach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors is not presented in any order of priority. The explanation of the factors and the\nreasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled\n\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRecommendation of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has unanimously:\ndetermined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders\u037e\nauthorized and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement\u037e and\n34 \n\u2022 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndirected that the approval of the merger be submitted for consideration by the holders of common stock at the\nspecial meeting.\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\nWe do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance due to, among other things, the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and\nestimates may not be realized. However, in connection with our evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and\nspecifically the merger, our management prepared certain forward-looking financial projections for the Company on a\nconsolidated basis for fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, through December 31, 2026 (the \u201cCompany financial\nprojections\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes the Company financial projections that were provided to our board of directors, to certain\nbidders, including Brookfield, and to Morgan Stanley, and which our board of directors directed Morgan Stanley to use and\nrely upon in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis and opinion rendered to our board of directors, as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201c -Opinion of Our Financial Advisor.\u201d\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\n(in millions)\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nHotel EBITDA\n$224\n$279\n$302\n$319\n$343\nNet Operating Income\n188\n238\n259\n274\n295\nCorporate EBITDA\n192\n245\n268\n283\n307\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n150\n215\n211\n213\n277\nHotel EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and was calculated as net income (calculated in accordance with\nGAAP) before interest, provision for / benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains / losses from\nsales of real estate, gains / losses on property related insurance claims, losses on extinguishment of debt, impairment\ncharges, transaction costs, non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, deferred franchise costs, deferred\nkey money, corporate general and administrative expenses and other owner related costs\u037e adjusted for WLT\u2019s pro rata\nshare of joint venture interests.\nNet Operating Income is a non-GAAP financial measure and was calculated as Hotel EBITDA less furniture fixtures and\nequipment reserves (\u201cFF&E\u201d) at WLT\u2019s pro rata ownership share.\nCorporate EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and was calculated as Hotel EBITDA less corporate general and\nadministrative expenses.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and was calculated as Corporate EBITDA less capital\nexpenditure spend at WLT\u2019s pro rata ownership share.\nImportant Information About the Company Financial Projections\nThe Company financial projections are included solely to give our stockholders access to certain information that was\nmade available to our board of directors, Morgan Stanley and certain bidders, including Brookfield, and used by Morgan\nStanley in connection with its financial analysis and fairness opinion. The Company financial projections have not been\nupdated following April 11, 2022, to reflect our current views of our future financial performance, and they should not be\ntreated as guidance with respect to projected results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, or any other period. The\nCompany financial projections are subjective in many respects and were prepared solely for our internal use, to assist\nprospective bidders in connection with their due diligence review, and for Morgan Stanley for use in connection with its\nfinancial analysis and fairness opinion. The Company financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public\ndisclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial\ninformation, or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm has not compiled, examined, audited, or performed any procedures with respect to the\nCompany financial projections and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this\ninformation or its achievability. The inclusion of the Company financial projections in this proxy statement does not\nconstitute an admission or representation by us that the information is material.\n35 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe above financial data were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hotel EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Corporate\nEBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that we use in analyzing our financial results\nand believe that they enhance investors\u2019 understanding of our financial performance and the comparability of our results to\nprior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial\ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from others in\nthe industry and Hotel EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Corporate EBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not\nnecessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were\nnot relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion to our board of directors (as described below in the section\nentitled \u201c-Opinion of Our Financial Advisor\u201d) or by our board of directors or Brookfield in connection with their\nconsideration of the merger. Accordingly, we have not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures\nincluded in the Company financial projections.\nIn the view of our management, the Company financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting\nmanagement\u2019s best available estimates and judgments regarding our future financial performance at the time they were\nprepared.\nThe Company financial projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables,\nestimates and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,\ncompetitive, regulatory and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which\nare beyond our control. The Company financial projections were developed under the assumption of continued standalone\noperation, do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the\nCompany financial projections were prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or\nany effects of the merger. Further, the Company financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of\nthe merger to be consummated and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Company financial\nprojections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the Company\nfinancial projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive\nyear. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Company financial projections include,\nbut are not limited to, local market conditions, general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial, debt, capital,\ncredit or securities markets, developing industry dynamics, competition, our ability to obtain financing, development and\nredevelopment costs, changes in business strategy and those additional risks and factors discussed in reports filed with\nthe SEC by the Company from time to time, including those discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s\nmost recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other\nreports filed with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may cause our future financial results to materially\nvary from the projections summarized above, see the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.\u201d\nThe Company financial projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in general\nbusiness or economic conditions, certain accounting assumptions, timing of business investments, changes in actual or\nprojected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax or other laws or regulations or any other transaction or\nevent that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the Company financial projections were\nprepared. In addition, the Company financial projections may be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals,\nobjectives and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from\nthose contained in the Company financial projections. The Company financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in\nconjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our public filings with the SEC.\nThere can be no assurance that the financial results in the Company financial projections will be realized or that future\nactual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in the Company financial projections.\nThe inclusion of the Company financial projections and accompanying narrative in the tables above should not be\nregarded as an indication that the Company, Brookfield, our or its respective affiliates, or our, its or their respective officers,\ndirectors, advisors or other representatives, consider the Company financial projections to be necessarily predictive of\nactual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company, Brookfield, our or its\nrespective affiliates, or our, its or their respective officers, directors, advisors or other representatives, gives any of our\nstockholders or any other person any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Company financial\nprojections\u037e and the Company, Brookfield, our and its respective affiliates, and our, its and their respective officers,\ndirectors, advisors and other representatives, undertake no obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the\nCompany financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the dates on which the Company financial projections\nwere prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and\nestimates underlying the Company financial projections are shown to be in error or are no longer appropriate. Some or all of\nthe assumptions that have been\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmade in connection with the preparation of the Company financial projections may have changed since the date the\nCompany financial projections were prepared. These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the\nCompany financial projections.

LLC\nThe Company retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with a possible\nstrategic transaction, and, if requested by the Company, a financial opinion with respect thereto. The Company selected\nMorgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise and reputation in the\nCompany\u2019s sector and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company, and its substantial experience in\ntransactions similar to the merger.

The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley\nin rendering its opinion. Stockholders are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion is directed to the Company\u2019s board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the consideration to be received by the\nholders of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock and Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such holders of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock as of the date of the opinion. The summary of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement and its opinion were for the benefit of\nour board of directors (in its capacity as such), and Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was rendered to our board of directors in connection\nwith its evaluation of the merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address any other aspect of the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement and was not intended to, and does not, constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder\nshould vote or act at the special meeting to be held or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement.\n37 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the\nCompany\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data concerning the\nCompany\u037e\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with\nsenior executives of the Company\u037e\nreviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the\nmerger, prepared by the management of the Company\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company,\nincluding information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the\nmerger, with senior executives of the Company\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of the Company with that of certain other publicly traded companies\ncomparable with the Company, and their securities\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions\u037e\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Parent\nEntities and their financial and legal advisors\u037e\nreviewed the merger agreement, the draft commitment letters from certain lenders and financing sources\nsubstantially in the form of the drafts dated April 19, 2022 and April 20, 2022, respectively, and certain related\ndocuments\u037e and\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as\nMorgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by\nthe Company and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information\nrelating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the mergers, Morgan Stanley assumed that\nthey have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nmanagement of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed\nthat the mergers would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver,\namendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that the Parent Entities would obtain\nfinancing in accordance with the terms of the commitment letters, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ\nin any material respect from the May 5, 2022 draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in\nconnection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the\nproposed mergers, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse\neffect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed mergers. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without\nindependent verification, the assessment by the management of the Company of: (i) the strategic, financial and other\nbenefits expected to result from the mergers\u037e and (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company\nand the Parent Entities. Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and the opinion did not address, any other term or\naspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or\ninstrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith, including, without\nlimitation, any terms, aspects or implications of any related transactions. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory\nadvisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of\nthe Company and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley\nexpressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received by any of the\nCompany\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by\nthe holders of\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock (other than the holders of the excluded common shares). Morgan Stanley also\nexpressed no opinion as to the relative or standalone fairness of any portion of the consideration to be received by holders\nof any separate class of Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the\nfairness of the amount or nature of the consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement by holders of\nrestricted stock units in the Company, Series B preferred stock of the Company, Class A OP units of the Partnership, or any\nother equity interests of the Company or the Partnership, except for the holders of shares of Company\u2019s common stock\n(other than the holders of the excluded common shares). Morgan Stanley was advised by the Company that the Company\nhas operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its\nformation as a REIT and Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers would not adversely affect such status or operations of\nthe Company. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the\nCompany, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was\nnecessarily based on financial, economic, market, tax and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to them as of, May 6, 2022. Events occurring after May 6, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the\nassumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this\nopinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral\nopinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Company\u2019s board of directors dated May 6, 2022. The\nfollowing summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan\nStanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight\ngiven to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In\norder to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in\nthe tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors\nreviewed, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process\nunderlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is\nnot in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.\nFor purposes of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the analyses described below, the Company advised Morgan Stanley that\nthe Company had paid distribution and servicing fees to broker dealers on behalf of the holders of Class T common stock\nin an amount equal to approximately $4,198,641 (the \u201cPaid Broker Dealer Fees\u201d), and as a result of the reimbursement of\nsuch Paid Broker Dealer Fees to the Company, the per Company T share merger consideration was less than the per\nCompany A share merger consideration by $0.069 per share. For additional information relating to the adjustment to the per\nshare merger consideration relating to fees attributable to the Class T common stock, see the section entitled \u201cQuestions\nand Answers About the Special Meeting and the Merger.\u201d\nNet Asset Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley analyzed the value of the Company as a function of the net value of its assets. Morgan Stanley based its\nnet asset value analysis on our management\u2019s publicly disclosed estimates of net asset value as of December 31, 2021.\nMorgan Stanley calculated the estimated net asset value per share of the Company\u2019s common stock based on the\npublished appraisal performed by CBRE Hotels and estimates of the fair market value of Company debt provided by Robert\nA. Stanger & Co. As discussed and agreed with Company management, Morgan Stanley adjusted such estimated net asset\nvalue per share to account for exercising the call option that will allow the Company to purchase warrants, Class A OP units\nreceived upon exercise of warrants, and shares of Class A common stock issued upon redemption of such Class A OP units.\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley separately calculated an adjusted estimated net asset value per share that deducted the\nestimated costs required to consummate the transactions (based on the Parent Entities\u2019 cost estimate of approximately $143\nmillion). An implied per share equity value reference range for the Company was then calculated based on the range of net\nasset values derived from such analyses divided by the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock\noutstanding. These analyses indicated the following implied per share equity value reference ranges for each share of\nCompany common stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\nPublished NAV\n$6.29 per share of Class A common stock \n$6.22 per share of Class T common stock\nAdjusted NAV\n$6.50 per share of common stock (blended)\nAdjusted NAV Net of Transaction Costs\n$5.89 per share of common stock (blended)\n39 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the Company, which is designed to provide an implied value\nof a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows and the terminal value of\nthe company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share equity values as of September 30, 2022 for the shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock. Morgan Stanley used estimates from the Company\u2019s financial forecasts for purposes of its\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows for the stub period from September 30, 2022\nthrough fiscal year 2022 and fiscal years 2023 through 2026, and a terminal year of 2027 (determined in accordance with the\nCompany\u2019s model) (the \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d), which it calculated by deducting from Corporate EBITDA for each\nsuch fiscal year net capital expenditures and making certain further investment adjustments. The estimates of Unlevered\nFree Cash Flow were based on the Company\u2019s financial forecasts.\nMorgan Stanley then discounted the estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flow to present value as of September 30, 2022, using\nrates based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s judgment of the estimated range of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital of\n8.7% to 9.5%, to derive ranges of implied enterprise values for the Company. From the ranges of implied enterprise values,\nMorgan Stanley then deducted the Company\u2019s projected net debt of approximately $1.732 billion as of September 30, 2022,\nthe liquidation value of preferred equity, and the proposed amount required for exercising the call option that will allow the\nCompany to purchase warrants, Class A OP units received upon exercise of warrants, and shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon redemption of such Class A OP units, to arrive at a range of implied equity values for the Company, which\nimplied equity values were subsequently divided by the number of fully diluted shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to\nderive a range of implied share prices as of September 30, 2022, which ranges were adjusted to reflect sensitizing\nincremental projected capital expenditure spend during the period analyzed that could be required to maintain and improve\nperformance based on third party data sources and guidance from the Company\u2019s management.\nThis analysis implied the following ranges of per share equity value for the Company\u2019s common stock:\nExit \nMultiple\nWACC\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue \nof Company Common Stock\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n11.7x-13.0x\n8.7%-9.5%\n$6.03-$7.70\nDiscounted Cash Flow Adjusted for Incremental\nCapEx\n11.7x-13.0x\n8.7%-9.5%\n$5.41-$7.08\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which is designed to provide an implied trading value of\na company by comparing it to selected companies with similar characteristics to the Company. Morgan Stanley reviewed\nand compared certain financial information of the Company with publicly available information, including publicly available\nmarket multiples, for a group of selected companies to derive an implied equity value reference range for the Company.\nMorgan Stanley chose the following companies based on, among other things, knowledge of the lodging REIT industry\nand the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to the company with respect to company portfolio,\nsize, asset type, asset quality and geographic exposure and other characteristics that Morgan Stanley deemed relevant.\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company (NYSE: DRH)\nHersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE: HT)\nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: HST)\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: PK)\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB)\n40 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (NYSE: SHO)\nXenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: XHR)\nFor each of the following analyses performed by Morgan Stanley, financial and market data for the group of selected\ncompanies were based on the most recent publicly available information and Street consensus estimates. Morgan Stanley\nalso analyzed for each of these companies the premium or discount represented by the ratio of share price to Street\nconsensus estimated net asset value per share.\nWith respect to the group of selected companies, the information Morgan Stanley presented included:\nmultiple of aggregate value to estimated EBITDA for 2022 (\u201cAdj. AV / 2022E EBITDA\u201d)\u037e\nmultiple of aggregate value to estimated EBITDA for 2023 (\u201cAdj.

The multiples and premium or discount to NAV\nfor each of the selected companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on April 29, 2022. Based on the\nanalysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected peer REITs, Morgan Stanley selected a range of multiples and\npercentages based on top and bottom quartiles and applied this range of multiples and percentages to the relevant\nfinancial statistics for the Company to derive separate implied per share equity value references ranges for the Company\ncommon stock.\nMorgan Stanley estimated the implied per share equity value of the Company\u2019s common stock as of September 30, 2022, as\nfollows:\nMultiple Statistic\n/\u200b\nPercentage Range\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue \nof Company Common Stock\nAdj. AV / 2022E EBITDA\n16.0x-17.5x\n$4.96-$6.18\nAdj.

In evaluating the group of selected\ncompanies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as\nthe impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of\nany material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the financial\nmarkets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method\nof using comparable company data.\nSelect Precedent M&A Transactions Analysis\nUsing publicly available information, Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of selected precedent (i) transactions with a deal\nvalue in excess of $500 million announced since 2015, in which the targets were lodging REITs that operate in and/or were\nexposed to similar lines of business as the Company, and (ii) privatizations of publicly traded U.S. REITs with deal value in\nexcess of $500 million since 2010. The following table sets forth the selected transactions considered, including their\nrespective dates of announcement:\n41 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelect Precedent M&A Transactions\nAcquiror/Target\nAnnouncement \nDate\nDeal \nType\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. / Chesapeake Lodging Trust\nMay 2019\nPublic M&A\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust / LaSalle Hotel Properties\nSeptember\n2018\nPublic M&A\nRLJ Lodging Trust / FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated\nApril 2017\nPublic M&A\nBluesky Hotels and Resorts Inc. / InnVest Real Estate Investment Trust\nMay 2016\nTake Private\nBlackstone Real Estate Advisors / Strategic Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\nSeptember\n2015\nTake Private\nMorgan Stanley reviewed for each of the transactions listed above for the multiple of aggregate value over next twelve\nmonths EBITDA. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available Street consensus estimates,\npublic filings and other publicly available information at the time of the relevant transaction announcement. Morgan\nStanley selected the 25th and 75th percentiles of multiples for the relevant transactions and applied these ranges of\nmultiples to the relevant financial statistics for the Company to estimate the implied per share equity value of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock as of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.\nThe following presents the results of this analysis:\nMultiple\nStatistic \nRange\nImplied Per Share\nEquity \nValue of Company \nCommon Stock\nAV / NTM EBITDA as of 3/31/2022\n14.4x-16.0x\n$4.99-$6.46\nAV / NTM EBITDA as of 9/30/2022\n14.4x-16.0x\n$5.91-$7.46\nMorgan Stanley also analyzed the premium or discount to Street consensus net asset values for precedent REIT take-\nprivate transactions with deal value in excess of $500 million since 2010. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley\nadjusted the reported net asset values of the Company to adjust for the proposed execution of the call option of\noutstanding Company warrants. The resulting average implied premiums and discounts to NAV from the precedent\nprivatization transactions were applied to the Company\u2019s Adjusted NAV, resulting in the following range of implied per\nshare equity values of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of September 30, 2022:\nPercentage\nRange\nImplied Per Share\nEquity \nValue of Company \nCommon Stock\nP / (D) to Consensus NAV (Applied to Company Adjusted NAV)\n(3.2%)-9.3%\n$6.29-$7.10\nNo company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the selected precedent transactions analysis is identical to the\nCompany, nor are the transactions identical to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In evaluating the\ntransactions listed above, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control,\nsuch as the impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally, industry growth and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company or the industry or in the\nfinancial markets in general, which could affect the value of the Company and the aggregate value of the transactions to\nwhich the merger is being compared. Accordingly, mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not\nin itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.\nGeneral\nMorgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The\npreparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary\ndescription. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not\nattribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion\nof its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its\nanalyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than\nother analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresult, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan\nStanley\u2019s view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous\nassumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions\nand other matters which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness of the per Company\nA share merger consideration to be received by the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock and the per Company\nT share merger consideration to be received by the holders of Class T common stock, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the date of the opinion, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as\nof May 6, 2022, to the Company\u2019s board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals of the shares of\nCompany common stock. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how the Stockholders of the\nCompany should act or vote at the special meeting to be held or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement.\nThe consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and the Parent Entities and\nwas approved by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Company during these\nnegotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific form, mix or amount of consideration to the Company, or that\nany specific form, mix or amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business transaction, or\nother alternatives, and expressed no opinion as to the relative or standalone fairness of any portion of the consideration to\nthe holders of any separate class of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Company\u2019s board of directors was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Company\u2019s board of directors in deciding to adopt and approve the merger agreement, the merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated thereby. See the section entitled \u201cReasons for the Merger.\u201d Consequently, the\nanalyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Company\u2019s board of directors\nwith respect to the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to the\nmerger agreement or of whether the Company\u2019s board of directors would have been willing to agree to different\nconsideration.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in\naccordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities,\ninvestment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities\nunderwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as\nwell as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors\nand officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance\npositions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its\ncustomers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, the Parent Entities, their respective affiliates, or any other\ncompany, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, as compensation for its services relating to the merger, the Company has agreed\nto pay Morgan Stanley a fee of up to approximately $37 million in the aggregate, $4 million of which was payable upon\nannouncement of the merger and up to approximately $33 million of which is contingent upon the consummation of the\nmerger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain of its expenses incurred in performing its\nservices, including certain fees of outside counsel. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and\nits affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley\nor any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws,\nrelated to or arising out of Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of delivery of Morgan Stanley\u2019s written opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates\nprovided financial advisory services to the Company and financial advisory and financing services for the Parent Entities\nor their respective affiliates and have received fees from the Company of approximately $5-10 million and from the Parent\nEntities and their affiliates of approximately $35-60 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek\nto provide financial advisory and financing services to the Parent Entities, the Company and their respective affiliates in\nthe future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinancing\nIn connection with the closing of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Parent\nEntities will cause an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion to be paid to the holders of common stock, Series B preferred\nstock, RSU awards, warrants and Class A OP units (other than excluded shares). The Parent Entities have informed us that\nthey expect certain of our mortgage loans to be repaid or remain outstanding. As of June 14, 2022, we had approximately\n$2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated indebtedness outstanding, including mortgage loans and\nmezzanine loans.\nIn connection with the merger agreement, the Parent Entities have entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders to\nobtain debt financing in connection with the merger. Also in connection with the merger agreement, the Sponsors have\nentered into an equity commitment letter to contribute equity to the Parent Entities for the purpose of funding the\nacquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by such debt financing.\nThe Parent Entities have informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained\nfrom the debt and equity financing may be used for purposes such as reserves, the refinancing of certain of our existing\ndebt, funding working capital requirements, and for other costs and expenses related to the financing and the merger. The\nParent Entities have informed us that they currently believe that the funds to be borrowed under the potential debt\nfinancing would be secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly\nowned by us, certain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and\nperfect their interests in the applicable collateral, and that such debt financing would be conditioned on the merger being\ncompleted and other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe merger agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the merger.\nWe have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause our subsidiaries to use their\nreasonable best efforts, to cooperate as may be customary and reasonably requested by the Parent Entities to the extent\nrequired in connection with the arrangement of debt financing. For more information, see the sections entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Certain Other Covenants\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal and the other proposals in\nthis proxy statement, our stockholders should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have certain\ninterests in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, that are different from, or in\naddition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our board\nof directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the decision to authorize\nand approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These\ninterests are discussed below.\nRSU Awards\nThe merger agreement provides that effective immediately prior to the company merger effective time, each RSU award\n(whether vested or unvested) granted pursuant to the Company\u2019s 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, outstanding\nas of immediately prior to the company merger effective time will be cancelled, in exchange for the right to receive an\namount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to the RSU award immediately prior to\nthe company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) the per Company A share merger consideration, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nAs of June 14, 2022, our executive officers collectively owned 1,512,625 unvested RSU awards. The following table sets\nforth the number of shares of common stock represented by unvested RSU awards held by our executive officers as of June\n14, 2022, as well as the value of those shares based on the per Company A share merger consideration of $6.768 per share\nof Class A common stock. As of June 14, 2022, none of our directors owned unvested RSU awards. All vested RSU awards\nhave previously been settled by the delivery of shares of Class A common stock.\nName\nRSU Awards \n(#)\nValue of RSU Awards \n($)\nExecutive Officers\nMichael G.

Michael Medzigian, Brendan\nMedzigian and Samuel Zinsmaster, entered into a binding summary of terms with Merger Sub I (the \u201cemployment term\nsheet\u201d). Pursuant to the employment term sheet, Merger Sub I and each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian\nand Zinsmaster agreed to negotiate and memorialize in good faith, within 30 days after the date of the employment term\nsheet, definitive employment terms with the Company (and Brookfield, as applicable) for the duration of the interim period\nand for a specified period of time following the closing of the mergers.\nThe employment term sheet contemplates, among other things:\nExisting Retention/Severance. The Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. Employee Retention and Severance Plan,\neffective November 2021 (\u201cretention plan\u201d), in which Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster each\nparticipates pursuant to a participation agreement, effective as of November 11, 2021, will remain in effect as\nof and following the closing of the mergers. Each such participation agreement provides that each of Messrs.\nBrendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster will receive:\n\u201cretention benefits\u201d  (as defined in the applicable participation agreement) in cash of $550,000 for Mr.\nBrendan Medzigian and $400,000 for Mr. Zinsmaster-upon the earlier of (i) three months after the\nclosing of the mergers and (ii) a severance-eligible termination and\n\u201cseverance amounts\u201d  (as defined in the applicable participation agreement) of $866,667 for Mr.\nBrendan Medzigian and $800,000 for Mr. Zinsmaster as provided for under the existing participation\nagreements-upon a severance-eligible termination.\nThe employment agreement, executed October 22, 2019, by and between Michael G. Medzigian and Carey\nWatermark Investors 2 Incorporated (the \u201cMGM employment agreement\u201d) will be amended to provide that Mr.\nMichael Medzigian will receive:\nan amount equal to $7,531,875, which is the maximum amount of severance that would be available if\nhis employment were terminated other than for \u201cCause\u201d  (as defined in the MGM employment\nagreement)-upon a severance-eligible termination.\nA \u201cseverance-eligible termination\u201d means (1) termination of employment by the Company without \u201cCause\u201d (as\ndefined in the retention plan or the MGM employment agreement, as applicable), (2) resignation from\nemployment by the applicable individual for \u201cGood Reason\u201d  (as defined in the retention plan or the MGM\nemployment agreement, as applicable), or (3) resignation from employment by the applicable individual during\nthe 30-day period following completion of the applicable service obligation (as defined below).\nThe \u201cservice obligation\u201d means, with respect to Messrs. Michael Medzigian and Brendan Medzigian, the\nthree-month period, and with respect to Mr. Zinsmaster, the six-month period, in each case immediately\nfollowing (i) the closing of the mergers or (ii) the termination of the merger agreement, whichever is earlier.\nAdditional Retention/Transaction Bonuses. As expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, and as\ndisclosed in the disclosure letter delivered in connection therewith, the Company may provide retention\ncompensation and benefits of up to $4 million to employees during the interim period-of which $1.8 million will\nbe allocated to Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster as described below (in addition to the existing\nretention and severance amounts described above) and $2.2 million will be allocated to employees other than\nMessrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster. The employment term sheet contemplates\nthat prior to the closing of the mergers, each of Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster will enter into a\nretention agreement (each, a \u201cnew retention agreement\u201d) that is substantially similar in all material respects to\nthe \u201cretention benefit\u201d provisions of their participation agreements, as amended (as described above). The\nnew retention agreements will provide that Messrs. Brendan Medzigian and Zinsmaster (as applicable) will\neach receive (in addition to the existing retention and severance amounts described above):\na retention bonus of $900,000 in cash-within ten days following completion the applicable service\nobligation.\n45 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n280G Gross-up. Subject to the limitations in the employment term sheet, if the mergers are consummated, the\nCompany will provide a tax gross-up payment to each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and\nZinsmaster if any of them receives, or will receive, transaction-based payments that trigger excise taxes in\nconnection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, under Section\n4999 of the Code, the amount of which will be sufficient to put each such individual in the net after-tax\nposition that he would have been in had such excise taxes not become due and payable\u037e provided that the\nmaximum gross-up payment for Mr. Michael Medzigian will be $3 million.\nThe table below under the section entitled \u201c-Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits\u201d reflects the amount of\nseverance payments and benefits that our executive officers would be entitled to receive under the applicable employment\nagreement upon termination of such executive officer\u2019s employment by us without \u201cCause\u201d or by the executive officer for\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d following the mergers.\nSummary of Terms: Advisory Agreement\nOn May 6, 2022, Watermark Capital Partners, which is 100% owned by Mr. Michael Medzigian, our Chief Executive Officer,\nentered into a summary of terms with the Sponsors (the \u201cadvisory term sheet\u201d). Pursuant to the advisory term sheet, if the\nSponsors in their sole discretion require Watermark Capital Partners to enter into an advisory agreement, the Sponsors and\nWatermark Capital Partners agree to negotiate and attempt to agree, in good faith prior to the closing of the mergers, to the\nterms of a definitive advisory agreement.\nThe advisory term sheet sets forth certain terms and conditions for the potential advisory agreement between Watermark\nCapital Partners and the Sponsors (or an affiliate thereof) with respect to one or more real estate investment trusts to be\nformed to hold interests in hotel properties owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. The advisory term sheet\ncontemplates, among other things: (i) certain services to be provided by Watermark Capital Partners to such REITs relating\nto such hotel properties\u037e (ii) an initial term of two years and, after one year, the right of each party to terminate the\nagreement on not less than 60 days\u2019 prior written notice\u037e (iii) an annual fee of $1 million, and reimbursement of Watermark\nCapital Partners\u2019 reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in performing the services\u037e and\n(iv) mutual indemnification obligations of Watermark Capital Partners and Brookfield and such REITs.\nIndemnification of Our Directors and Executive Officers\nThe merger agreement provides that from and after the company merger effective time, the Parent Entities will, and will\ncause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify,\ndefend and hold harmless each of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and our subsidiaries and each\nfiduciary under the Company\u2019s or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 benefit plans (collectively, the \u201cindemnified persons\u201d), against (i)\nall losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, actions, suits, damages\nor liabilities or, subject to certain exceptions, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,\nproceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions\noccurring at or prior to the company merger effective time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the company\nmerger effective time), including in connection with the consideration, negotiation and approval of the merger agreement,\nto the extent that such actions or omissions are based on or arise out of the fact that such indemnified person is or was a\ndirector, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans, including any payment by the Surviving Company or the Surviving\nPartnership on behalf of or advancement to such indemnified person of any expenses incurred by such indemnified person\nin connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement (collectively, the\n\u201cindemnified liabilities\u201d), and (ii) all indemnified liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the company merger\neffective time), including any expenses incurred by such indemnified person in connection with enforcing any rights with\nrespect to such indemnification and/or advancement.\nThe merger agreement also requires the Parent Entities to cause the Surviving Company to maintain our officers\u2019 and\ndirectors\u2019 liability insurance policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement for at least six years after the closing of\nthe merger (or substitute policies with at least the same coverage and amounts, or \u201ctail\u201d policies on conditions that are no\nless advantageous than the existing insurance policies). This requirement is subject to a maximum cost of 300% of our\ncurrent annual premiums paid for such insurance (the \u201cmaximum amount\u201d). Also, if the cost of the annual premiums\nnecessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the maximum amount, the Parent Entities and the\nSurviving Company will procure and maintain the most advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the\nmaximum amount.\n46 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditionally, the merger agreement provides that for at least six years from the company merger effective time, the\nSurviving Company and the Surviving Partnership will provide to the indemnified persons the same rights to exculpation,\nindemnification and advancement of expenses that are provided to the indemnified persons under the Company\u2019s and our\nsubsidiaries\u2019 organizational documents in effect as of the date of the merger agreement. The Surviving Company and the\nSurviving Partnership will assume specified contractual indemnification rights with any of the Company\u2019s or our\nsubsidiaries\u2019 current or former directors, officers or employees pursuant to specified agreements in existence on the date of\nthe merger agreement.\nThe parties have agreed not to terminate or modify these obligations set forth in the merger agreement regarding\nindemnified persons in such a manner as to adversely affect such indemnified persons, and these obligations must be\nassumed by any successor entity to the Surviving Company as a result of any consolidation, merger, dissolution or\ntransfer of all or substantially all of its properties and assets.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits\nThe table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding\ncertain compensation which each of our \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d may receive that is based on or that otherwise relates\nto the merger. This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation in Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. This\ncompensation payable to our named executive officers is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of our common\nstockholders as described above under the heading \u201cProposal 2: Advisory Compensation Proposal.\u201d\nThe amounts in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below. The actual value to be received by our named\nexecutive officers may be greater or less than the amounts presented below. The amounts in the table below do not reflect\nany reduction in payments pursuant to the employment agreements to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of each\nnamed executive officer\u2019s merger-related payments and benefits from becoming subject to excise tax by reason of Section\n4999 of the Code. For purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed, among other things:\nNovember 7, 2022 (which is the outside date under the merger agreement) as the closing date of the mergers\u037e\nmerger consideration of $6.768 per share of Class A common stock and $6.699 per share of Class T common\nstock\u037e and\nwith respect to each of Messrs. Michael Medzigian, Brendan Medzigian and Samuel Zinsmaster, the deemed\ntermination of each such named executive officer\u2019s employment by us without \u201ccause\u201d in connection with\nclosing of the mergers.\n\u201cGolden Parachute\u201d Compensation\nName\nCash  \n($)\nEquity  \n($)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits  \n($)\nTotal \n($)\nExecutive Officers\nMichael G.

This summary is not intended as tax advice. The tax treatment of a holder will vary depending upon the holder\u2019s\nparticular situation, and this summary addresses only holders that hold shares of our common stock as capital assets and\ndoes not deal with all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment or\ntax circumstances. This summary also does not deal with all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of\nholders to which special provisions of the U.S. federal income tax laws apply, including:\ndealers in securities or currencies\u037e\ntraders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for such traders\u2019 securities\nholdings\u037e\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\ninsurance companies\u037e\ntax-exempt organizations\u037e\nS corporations, REITs, regulated investment companies (\u201cRICs\u201d) or partnerships and other types of \u201cflow-\nthrough\u201d entities (and investors therein)\u037e\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\npersons that hold shares of our common stock that are a hedge, that are hedged against interest rate or\ncurrency risks, or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction\u037e\npersons that purchase or sell shares of our common stock as part of a \u201cwash sale\u201d for tax purposes\u037e\npersons that acquired shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee options or otherwise\nas compensation, including persons who are subject to Section 1061 of the Code with respect to gain from our\nshares\u037e\nU.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States\u037e and\nU.S. stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nThis summary is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Code, published\nrulings and court decisions. This summary describes the provisions of these sources of law only as they are currently in\neffect. All of these sources of law may change at any time, and any change in the law may apply retroactively. Changes in\nU.S. federal, state and local tax laws or regulations, with or without retroactive application, could have a negative effect on\nthe Company. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly\nand negatively affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Company\u2019s investors.\nIf a partnership holds shares of our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend\non the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding shares of our\ncommon stock should consult its tax advisor with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in the\nshares and the partnership merger.\n48 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs used in this section, the term \u201cU.S. stockholder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, who, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, is:\na citizen or resident of the U.S.,\na domestic corporation,\nan estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the income\u2019s source, or\na trust if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust\u2019s administration and one or more U.S.\npersons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\nBeneficial owners of shares of common stock who are neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes are referred to in this section as \u201cnon-U.S. stockholders.\u201d\nALL HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE,\nLOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND APPLICABLE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nTax Treatment of the Merger\nThe parties to the merger agreement intend that for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes, the\nmerger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company will be treated as a taxable sale of the Company common stock to the\nParent Entities in exchange for the common stock merger consideration.\nConsequences of the Merger to U.S. Common Stockholders\nThe exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In general, a U.S. stockholder whose shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in\nthe merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between\nthe amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding\ntaxes, as described below under \u201c-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding\u201d) and the U.S. stockholder\u2019s adjusted\ntax basis in such shares. A U.S. stockholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. stockholder paid for\nthe U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares less any distributions received on such shares that were treated as returns of capital for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock held\nby a U.S. stockholder (i.e., shares of our common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Any such capital\ngain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss where the U.S. stockholder\u2019s holding period for such shares of our\ncommon stock is more than one year at the company merger effective time. Long-term capital gain of a noncorporate U.S.\nstockholder generally is taxed at preferential rates. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.\nThe common stock merger consideration received by a U.S. stockholder in exchange for shares of our common stock\npursuant to the merger will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. stockholders generally will not be\nable to apply any passive losses against that income or gain.\nConsequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Common Stockholders\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below under \u201c-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,\u201d a non-\nU.S. stockholder should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on any gain or loss from the merger unless: (1) the\ngain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or, if an\napplicable income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S.\nstockholder in the United States\u037e (2) the non-U.S. stockholder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or\nmore in the taxable year of the merger and certain other requirements are met\u037e or (3) such shares constitute a \u201cUnited States\nreal property interest\u201d under FIRPTA.\nA non-U.S. stockholder whose gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States\nwill generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. stockholder.\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as\nmay be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain described in clause (1) of the\nprevious paragraph.\nA non-U.S. stockholder who is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the\nmerger and who meets certain other requirements will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the merger,\nwhich may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. In addition, the non-U.S. stockholder may be subject to applicable\nalternative minimum taxes.\nIf a non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s shares constitute a United States real property interest under FIRPTA, any gain recognized by\nsuch holder in the merger will be subject to tax as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or\nbusiness of the non-U.S. stockholder and generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same\nmanner as income of a U.S. stockholder, although the above-described branch profits tax should not apply. A non-U.S.\nstockholder\u2019s common stock generally will not constitute a U.S. real property interest if (i) our common stock is regularly\ntraded on an established securities market, provided the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of our common\nstock, or (ii) we are a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the company merger effective time. For this\npurpose, a \u201cqualified investment entity\u201d includes a REIT. We do not believe that our common stock is regularly traded on\nan established securities market as of the date of this proxy statement and therefore the 10% exception will not apply to a\nnon-U.S. stockholder of our common stock. Assuming we qualify as a REIT with respect to the taxable year that includes\nthe company merger effective time, we will be a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d at the company\nmerger effective time if non-U.S. holders held directly or indirectly less than 50% in value of our common stock at all times\nduring the five-year period ending with the company merger effective time. Although we believe that we currently qualify\nas domestically controlled, no assurance can be provided that we so qualify or will continue to so qualify at the company\nmerger effective time, and we currently expect that a 15% withholding tax will apply to the common stock merger\nconsideration paid to non-U.S. stockholders.\nNon-U.S. stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of\ntheir particular circumstances.\nMedicare Tax\nA U.S. stockholder that is an individual or estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt\nfrom such tax, is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. stockholder\u2019s \u201cnet investment income\u201d  (or\n\u201cundistributed net investment income\u201d in the case of an estate or trust) for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of\nthe U.S. stockholder\u2019s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of\nindividuals is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual\u2019s circumstances). A holder\u2019s net investment\nincome generally includes the holder\u2019s dividend income and the holder\u2019s net gains from the disposition of shares of our\ncommon stock, unless such dividends or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business\n(other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). A U.S. stockholder that is an\nindividual, estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to such\nholder\u2019s income and gains in respect of such holder\u2019s investment in our common stock.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nA U.S. stockholder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding at the\napplicable rate (currently 24%) with respect to the common stock merger consideration received pursuant to the merger,\nunless such holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise\ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain holders (such as corporations and non-\nU.S. stockholders) are exempt from backup withholding. Non-U.S. stockholders may be required to comply with\ncertification requirements and identification procedures in order to establish an exemption from information reporting and\nbackup withholding (generally, by providing a completed and duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8). Backup withholding\nis not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited against a\nholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a\ntimely manner.\nPossible Legislative Changes-Possible Change in Tax Rates\nThis discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial\ninterpretations thereof, all as of the date of this proxy statement. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively,\nso\n50 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nas to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences (including applicable tax rates) different from those summarized above.\nWe cannot assure you that a change in law, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with retroactive\napplication, will not alter significantly the tax considerations (including applicable tax rates) that we describe herein. We\nhave not sought and do not plan to seek any ruling from the IRS, with respect to statements made and the conclusions\nreached in the above discussion, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and\nconclusions.\nTHE FOREGOING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nRELATING TO THE MERGER AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THEREFORE, COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO\nCONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE\nAPPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO APPLICABLE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nDeregistration of Our Common Stock\nIf the merger is completed, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.\n51 \n",

However, we may, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations and provide non-public information to a third party that has made an unsolicited written bona\nfide Company acquisition proposal, if the Company\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with\noutside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Company acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be\nexpected to lead to, a superior proposal.\nFor purposes of the merger agreement, a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d means a bona fide written Company acquisition proposal\n(except that for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of \u201cCompany acquisition proposal\u201d to \u201c15%\u201d\nwill be replaced by \u201c50%\u201d) made by a third party on terms that our board of directors determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with the Company\u2019s outside legal counsel and financial advisors:\n(A) would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\u2019s stockholders\n(solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the merger and\n(B) is reasonably likely to be consummated, after taking into account (x) the financial, legal, regulatory and\nany other aspects of such proposal, (y) the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the\nmerger) and (z) any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by the Parent Entities and any\nother information provided by the Parent Entities.\nWe are required to notify the Parent Entities in writing no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any Company\nacquisition proposal or any request for non-public information regarding the Company or any of our subsidiaries by any\nthird party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, a Company acquisition proposal, or any\nother inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with us regarding a possible Company\nacquisition proposal.

Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will not oppose the\ngranting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that the Parent Entities, Merger\nSub I or Merger Sub II has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate\nremedy for any reason at Law or in equity. The Parent Entities, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall not be required to\nprovide any bond or other security in connection with the request for or grant of any order or injunction to prevent a\nbreach of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms hereof.

Counterparts.
