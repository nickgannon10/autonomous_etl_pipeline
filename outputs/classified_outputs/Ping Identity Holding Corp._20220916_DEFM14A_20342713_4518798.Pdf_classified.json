The \u201cfair value\u201d of shares of Ping Identity common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration that stockholders would\notherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of\ntheir shares of Ping Identity common stock.\nThe right to seek appraisal will be lost if a Ping Identity stockholder votes \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself\nsufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To\nexercise appraisal rights, Ping Identity stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of\ntheir shares must so advise the Company by submitting a written demand for appraisal (or by electronic\ntransmission directed to an information processing system, if any, expressly designated for that purpose in\nthe notice of appraisal) to the Company prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special\nMeeting, and must otherwise strictly follow the applicable procedures and requirements prescribed by\nSection 262 of the DGCL.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nThe following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions\nregarding the Special Meeting and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions\nthat may be important to you as a holder of Ping Identity common stock. You should read the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the\ndocuments referred to in this proxy statement.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement?\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub.

On September 14, 2022, the most recent practicable date before the filing of this proxy\nstatement, the closing price of Ping Identity common stock was $28.26 per share.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company equity awards in the Merger?\nAt the Effective Time, each Option with an exercise price per share less than $28.50 that is unexpired,\nunexercised and outstanding, whether vested or unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will,\nat the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest\nand subject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company\nCommon Stock subject to such Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any,\nof $28.50 over the per share exercise price of such Option. At the Effective Time, each Option with an exercise\nprice per share equal to or greater than $28.50 that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding, whether\nvested or unvested, will be canceled with no cash payment made in respect thereof.

At the Effective Time, each Unvested RSU and each Unvested PSU\nwill be canceled and converted into a contingent right to receive an amount of cash (without interest and\nsubject to applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) $28.50 and (ii) the total number of shares\nof Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested RSU or Unvested PSU (with any applicable\nperformance conditions deemed achieved at target levels of performance) as of\n10 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time subject to the same terms and conditions, including with respect to\ntime-based vesting, as previously applicable to such Unvested RSU and Unvested PSU.\nWhen and where is the Special Meeting of our stockholders?\nThe special meeting will be held virtually on Monday, October 17, 2022, at 3 pm, Eastern time.

The inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting will determine whether a quorum is\npresent. The inspector of election will treat abstentions as present for purposes of determining the presence\nof a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the only business that can be transacted at the Special Meeting is\nthe adjournment or postponement of the meeting to another date or time.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Ping Identity common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record\ndate. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s\nfailure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank,\nbroker or other nominee), abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Merger Proposal.\nThe approval of the Compensation Proposal, on an advisory, non-binding basis, requires the affirmative vote\nof a majority of shares of Ping Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy.\nAccordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record holder\u2019s\nfailure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank,\nbroker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation\nProposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Compensation Proposal. The\napproval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory and non-binding and is not a condition to the\ncompletion of the Merger.\nThe approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of shares of Ping Identity common stock present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on\nsuch matter. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance at the Special Meeting (whether due to a record\nholder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s failure to provide any voting instructions to such\nholder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the\nAdjournment Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment\nProposal.\nWhat is a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d?\nIf a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a bank, broker or\nother nominee does not provide the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares with specific voting\ninstructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds the owner\u2019s shares may generally vote\non \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters but cannot vote on \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d matters. A so-called \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d\nresults when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for\nwhich the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because\nthey do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of relevant shares. Ping Identity does not expect any broker non-votes\nat the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide\nbrokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the\nproposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no bank, broker or\nother nominee will be permitted to vote your shares of Ping Identity common stock at the Special Meeting\nwithout receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee as to how to vote\n12 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nyour shares of Ping Identity common stock will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nHow does the Ping Identity Board recommend that I vote?\nThe Ping Identity Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Ping Identity Board considered in determining to recommend that\nPing Identity stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement titled\n\u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Ping Identity Board.\u201d In addition, in\nconsidering the recommendation of the Ping Identity Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you\nshould be aware that certain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally. Please see the section\nof this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger.\u201d\nWhy am I being asked to cast an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or may\nbecome payable to Ping Identity\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nThe SEC, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,\nadopted rules that require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain\npayments that may be made to the Company\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nWhat will happen if the Company\u2019s stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal?\nThe vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger\nAgreement. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Ping\nIdentity, the Ping Identity Board, Parent or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, because Ping Identity is\ncontractually obligated to pay the compensation, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the holders of Ping\nIdentity common stock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the\nconditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this advisory, non-binding vote.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of Ping Identity common stock before the Special Meeting?\nThe record date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you sell or transfer\nyour shares of Ping Identity common stock after the record date, but before the Special Meeting, you will\nretain your right to vote such shares at the Special Meeting. However, the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares. In order to receive the Merger\nConsideration in connection with the Merger, you must hold your shares of Ping Identity common stock\nthrough the Effective Time.\nWhat is a proxy?\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Ping Identity common stock. The\nwritten document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a\n\u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Ping Identity common\nstock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone\nprocess or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain\nfrom voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\n13 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted\non a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Proposal,\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In that\ncase, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.\nIf you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may vote by submitting your proxy via the\nInternet, by telephone or by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail in the prepaid\nreply envelope. You may also vote your shares by ballot via the Internet during the Special Meeting.

For more detailed instructions on how to vote using\none of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fVoting\nProcedures.\u201d\nIf you are a holder of record of shares of Ping Identity common stock and you submit a proxy card or voting\ninstructions but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in favor of\neach of the Merger Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal.\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of Ping Identity common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, broker or\nother nominee?\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d\nof shares of Ping Identity common stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been\nforwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to\nbe the stockholder of record.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must follow\nthe instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to vote such shares. Your bank, broker or\nother nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing\nthe voting instruction form sent to you by your bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement.\nWithout providing those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal\nor the Adjournment Proposal.\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nIf you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy or\nfail to give voting instructions to your broker, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Merger\nProposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nAssuming a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions, failures to vote and failures to give\nvoting instructions to your broker will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal or the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or my voting instructions?\nYes. If you are a stockholder with shares of Ping Identity common stock registered in your name, you may\nrevoke your proxy at any time prior to the time it is voted by:\nfiling with our Secretary a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy\u037e\nproperly casting a new vote via the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the\nInternet or telephone voting facilities described under \u201cThe Special Meeting\u202f-\u202fVoting Procedures\u201d\u037e\n14 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nduly completing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Secretary\u037e or\nattending the Special Meeting online and voting electronically during the meeting (although\nattendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).\nAny written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to our offices at\nPing Identity Holding Corp., 1001 17th Street, Suite 100, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attention: Chief Legal\nOfficer and Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting. If you want to revoke your proxy\nby sending a new proxy card or an instrument revoking the proxy to the Company, you should ensure that\nyou send your new proxy card or instrument revoking the proxy in sufficient time for it to be received by the\nCompany prior to the Special Meeting.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you must\ncontact your bank, broker or other nominee to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your shares\nelectronically at the Special Meeting.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or\nmultiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of Ping Identity common\nstock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each\nbrokerage account in which you hold shares of Ping Identity common stock. If you are a holder of Ping\nIdentity common stock of record and your shares of Ping Identity common stock are registered in more than\none name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit your proxy and/or voting instructions for\neach set of materials that you receive to ensure that all your shares of Ping Identity common stock are voted.\nIf I hold my shares of Ping Identity common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?\nNo. Promptly after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be sent a\nletter of transmittal describing the procedure for surrendering his, her, its or their shares in exchange for the\nMerger Consideration. If you hold your shares in certificated form, you will receive your cash payment after\nthe payment agent receives your stock certificates and any other documents requested in the instructions.\nYou should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your\nstock certificates to the payment agent without a letter of transmittal. If you hold shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock in uncertificated, book-entry form, you will not be required to deliver a stock certificate, and\nyou will receive your cash payment after the payment agent receives an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d and any other\ndocuments requested in the instructions.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nIf available, we may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting.

This means that holders of shares of Ping Identity common stock are entitled to have their shares\nappraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\n15 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntheir shares of Ping Identity common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair\nvalue, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference\nbetween the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Holders of Ping Identity common stock\nwho wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel\nwith respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.

See the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201cAppraisal Rights.\u201d\nWhen is the Merger expected to be completed?\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as promptly as possible, and currently expect to complete the\nMerger in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be\naccurately predicted, because the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, waiver) of the conditions to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company\u2019s respective obligations to\nconsummate the Merger, some of which are not within the parties\u2019 control.\nWhat effect will the Merger have on Ping Identity?\nIf the Merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ping Identity, the separate corporate\nexistence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease, and Ping Identity will continue to exist following the Merger\nas a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Following completion of the Merger, shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock will be delisted from the NYSE, and the registration of shares of Ping Identity common stock\nunder the Exchange Act will be terminated.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other\nreason, the holders of Ping Identity common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Ping\nIdentity common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent\npublic company and stockholders will continue to own their shares of Ping Identity common stock. The Ping\nIdentity common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the\nNYSE. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Ping Identity may be obligated to pay to\nParent a termination fee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more\nstockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides\nadvance notice and follows certain procedures.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER\nGeneral Description of the Merger\nThe Company, Parent and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement on August 2, 2022. A copy of the\nMerger Agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. On the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,\nMerger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will\nthereupon cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent.\nAt the Effective Time, and without any action by any stockholder, each share of Ping Identity common stock\nthat is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Ping\nIdentity common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately\nprior to the Effective Time or as to which holders thereof have properly exercised their statutory rights of\nappraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be automatically canceled, extinguished and\nconverted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nBackground of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger\nAgreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board,\nthe Transaction Committee or the representatives of the Company and other parties.\nThe Board and the Company\u2019s senior management periodically review the Company\u2019s long-term strategy and\nobjectives in light of market and industry conditions. These reviews have included, among other things,\nconsideration of organic growth initiatives, acquisitions, divestitures, and potential business combination\ntransactions, as well as other strategic opportunities, in each case, with a view towards enhancing\nstockholder value.\nOn October 7, 2021, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Andre Durand, Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, on an unsolicited basis, to discuss the industry generally. No proposal was made with respect to\nany acquisition or other transaction between Thoma Bravo and the Company during the conversation.\nThroughout the remaining pendency of negotiations with Thoma Bravo until the entry into the merger\nagreement on August 2, 2022, communications between the Company and Thoma Bravo at times included\ndiscussions with Orlando Bravo or Seth Boro, senior representatives of Thoma Bravo.\nOn November 12, 2021, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand regarding Thoma Bravo\u2019s\npotential interest in an acquisition of the Company. The representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr.\nDurand that Thoma Bravo intended to submit a non-binding indication of interest with respect to a potential\nacquisition of the Company, but did not propose any specific terms at that time. Mr. Durand did not respond\nsubstantively to representatives of Thoma Bravo but stated that he would inform the Board of Thoma\nBravo\u2019s potential interest at the next Board meeting.\nOn November 16, 2021, Mr. Durand informed members of the Board of Thoma Bravo\u2019s outreach on November\n12, 2021.\nOn November 18, 2021, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), the Company\u2019s outside legal advisor, in attendance. At\nthe meeting, Mr. Durand informed the Board of the recent inquiry from Thoma Bravo regarding interest in a\npotential transaction involving the Company. The Board discussed the importance of execution on fourth\nquarter 2022 business objectives to the Company\u2019s long-term prospects and the upcoming investor day\nscheduled for December 1, 2021. After discussion, the Board directed Mr. Durand to inform Thoma Bravo\nthat while the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create value for the Company\u2019s\nstockholders, the Company was focused on executing its plan for the remainder of the fourth quarter and its\nupcoming investor day, and not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction at that time. At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Kirkland also reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in\nthe context of receipt of an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and discussed certain considerations for the\nBoard when responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. In addition, the Board directed\n31 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement to prepare various financial scenarios applying different hypothetical assumptions related to\ngrowth rates to the strategic plan which had been previously prepared by management in the ordinary\ncourse, a portion of which hand been presented to the Board on November 2, 2021 in anticipation of its the\nCompany\u2019s investor day planned for December 1, 2021 (such portion being referred to herein as the\n\u201cNovember Strategic Plan\u201d).\nLater on November 18, 2021, Thoma Bravo submitted an unsolicited non-binding indication of interest to the\nBoard to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for $35.00 per share (the\n\u201cNovember Proposal\u201d), representing a 29% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $27.16 as of\nNovember 18, 2021. The November Proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would enable the\nCompany to solicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.\nLater that evening on November 18, 2021, the November Proposal was distributed to the Board for review.\nOn November 19, 2021, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand reiterating Thoma\nBravo\u2019s interest in acquiring the Company.\nAlso on November 19, 2021, Mr. Durand and Michael Fosnaugh, chairman of the Board, discussed the\nNovember Proposal, and Mr. Fosnaugh directed Mr. Durand to deliver the message directed by the Board to\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo.\nOn November 20, 2021, as directed by the Board, Mr. Durand responded to the senior representative of\nThoma Bravo and informed him that while the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that create\nvalue for the Company\u2019s stockholders, the Board was not contemplating pursuing a sale transaction at that\ntime in light of the Company\u2019s focus on executing its fourth quarter plan and its upcoming investor day.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company hosted its investor day.\nOn December 10, 2021, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Durand updated the Board on the recent\ncommunications with Thoma Bravo in which he had delivered the message previously directed by the Board,\nas described above. After discussion, the Board determined that it was still of the view that management\nshould focus on executing its plan for the fourth quarter and not on pursuing a potential strategic\ntransaction. Also at the meeting, the Company\u2019s management presented the various hypothetical financial\nscenarios that applied different growth rate assumptions developed by management to the November\nStrategic Plan. Following discussion, the Board instructed the Company\u2019s management to further refine such\nhypothetical scenarios. At the meeting, the Board also determined not to engage in discussions with any\nfinancial advisors at that time in order to minimize the risk of potential leaks and disruption to the business.\nOn January 4, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and requested a meeting\nfollowing the completion of the fourth quarter. Mr. Durand agreed to have a phone call with representatives\nof Thoma Bravo on January 18, 2022.\nOn January 12, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Fosnaugh and reiterated Thoma\nBravo\u2019s interest in a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Fosnaugh reiterated the Board\u2019s position\nthat the Company was focused on executing its standalone plan and not on pursuing a potential transaction\nat that time.\nOn January 18, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo and Mr. Durand had a phone conversation during\nwhich the representatives of Thoma Bravo reiterated Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest in a potential transaction with\nthe Company. Mr. Durand did not respond substantively to the representatives of Thoma Bravo but\nindicated that he would relay Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest to the Board.\nOn January 19, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Durand updated the Board on his recent\nconversation with representatives of Thoma Bravo. Also at the meeting, the Company\u2019s management\npresented various revised hypothetical financial scenarios that applied different growth rate assumptions\ndeveloped by management to the Company\u2019s November Strategic Plan. The Board asked questions related to\nthe assumptions that had been used in preparing the hypothetical financial scenarios. Following discussion,\nin\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlight of (i) the time that had passed following the submission of the November Proposal, (ii) the broader\ndecline in stock prices in the general market and in the identity and access management industry and in the\ncybersecurity industry more broadly, and (iii) the approximately 30% decline in the Company\u2019s stock price\nduring such time, the Board instructed Mr. Durand to inform Thoma Bravo that, while the Company remained\nfocused on executing its standalone plan and was not contemplating a potential sale transaction, if Thoma\nBravo remained interested in a transaction, they should submit an updated written proposal to the Board\nwhich confirmed the price per share at which Thoma Bravo would be willing to acquire all of the outstanding\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn January 24, 2022, Mr. Durand informed Thoma Bravo that, while the Company remained focused on\nexecuting its standalone plan and was not contemplating a potential sale transaction, but indicated that if\nThoma Bravo remained interested in a transaction, then it should resubmit an indication of interest that\nincluded Thoma Bravo\u2019s current proposed value for a potential transaction.\nOn January 31, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest\nto the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $26.00 per share (the \u201cJanuary\nProposal\u201d), representing a 38% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $18.90 as of January 28,\n2022. The January Proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would enable the Company to\nsolicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.\nOn February 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland in attendance. The Board discussed the terms of Thoma Bravo\u2019s January\nProposal, and, following discussion, determined (i) to reject Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposal in light of the proposed\nterms, and (ii) to inform Thoma Bravo that the Board did not find the proposal attractive and was focused on\nexecuting its current business plan, but that the Board was open to evaluating any opportunities that created\nvalue for all stockholders and there was sufficient public information available for Thoma Bravo to develop\nits views with respect to any potential transaction. The Board instructed Mr. Durand to convey that message\nto Thoma Bravo.\nOn February 8, 2022, Mr. Durand delivered the message directed by the Board to representatives of Thoma\nBravo.\nOn February 10, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Fosnaugh to reiterate Thoma\nBravo\u2019s interest in a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Fosnaugh reiterated the Board\u2019s position\nthat it was not interested in a transaction on the terms set forth in the January Proposal.\nAlso on February 10, 2022, a representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand to reiterate Thoma\nBravo\u2019s interest in a potential transaction with the Company.\nOn February 11, 2022, Mr. Durand responded to the representative of Thoma Bravo and reiterated the same\nBoard-directed message that he had delivered on February 8, 2022.\nLater on February 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding\nindication of interest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $30.00 per\nshare (the \u201cFebruary Proposal\u201d), representing a 49% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $20.10\nas of February 11, 2022. The February Proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would enable\nthe Company to solicit alternative bids for 30 days after signing.\nOn February 12, 2022, the February Proposal was distributed to the Board for review.\nOn February 23, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Kirkland in attendance. Mr. Durand updated the Board with respect to communications\nwith Thoma Bravo. The Board also discussed the Company\u2019s future prospects and noted its continued\nsupport of pursuing the Company\u2019s standalone plan. After discussion, the Board determined that the\nFebruary Proposal was insufficient for the Company to engage in further discussions about a potential\nstrategic transaction at the time and instructed management to convey the same to Thoma Bravo. After the\nBoard meeting, Mr. Durand conveyed the message to representatives of Thoma Bravo by telephone that\nsame day.\nOn April 19, 2022, representatives of a private equity firm, which we refer to herein as Party A, were, at the\nrequest of Party A, introduced by representatives of Goldman Sachs to Messrs. Durand and Dani via email.\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 21, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and expressed a continued\ninterest in exploring an acquisition of the Company and a continued interest in the industry.\nBetween the submission of Thoma Bravo\u2019s February Proposal and contact from the senior representative of\nThoma Bravo on April 21, 2022, market valuations declined precipitously, including for cybersecurity\nsoftware companies, interest rates increased significantly, and the market was impacted by growing\ninflationary pressures, including as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nOn May 2, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani had an in-person meeting with representatives of Party A, during\nwhich representatives of Party A outlined their thesis on the cybersecurity industry generally. The\nrepresentatives of Party A did not make any proposal with respect to a transaction with the Company at this\nmeeting.\nOn May 10, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo (including a senior representative of Thoma Bravo) had\ndinner with Mr. Durand. No proposal was made with respect to a potential transaction during the dinner, but\nthe senior Representative of Thoma Bravo noted that Thoma Bravo continued to be interested in a potential\ntransaction with the Company.\nOn May 15, 2022, Mr. Durand met virtually with representatives of Thoma Bravo, during which the\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo reiterated Thoma Bravo\u2019s continued interest in exploring an acquisition of\nthe Company and a continued interest in the industry.\nOn May 21, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and indicated that Thoma\nBravo intended to submit a revised written proposal to acquire all of the common stock of the Company.\nOn May 24, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding indication of\ninterest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $27.00 per share (the \u201cMay\nProposal\u201d), representing a 48% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $18.24 as of May 24, 2022.\nThe May Proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would enable the Company to solicit\nalternative bids for 30 days after signing.\nOn May 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives\nof Kirkland and Goldman Sachs, the Company\u2019s financial advisor, which had been invited to the meeting at\nthe request of the Board due to Goldman Sachs\u2019 longstanding relationship and familiarity with the Company,\nreputation as a highly regarded investment bank, substantial knowledge of the industry in which the\nCompany operates and extensive experience in providing financial advice in connection with strategic\ntransactions, in attendance. At the meeting, representatives of Kirkland reviewed with the Board its fiduciary\nduties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when undertaking an\nevaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. Also at the meeting, Mr.\nDurand updated the Board on the conversations held between Mr. Durand and representatives of Thoma\nBravo to date and the Board discussed the terms of Thoma Bravo\u2019s May Proposal. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs presented an overview of the current state of the markets, including current market valuation\nfor cybersecurity software companies, heightened market volatility, rising interest rates, constraints around\navailability of financing and growing inflationary pressures. The Board also discussed market conditions\ngenerally, including a potential recession and possible macroeconomic challenges facing the Company,\nincluding challenges relating to the Company\u2019s cloud transformation. As a result of such change in market\nconditions, the Board instructed the Company\u2019s management to prepare financial projections that were\nupdated to reflect the passage of time and the Board\u2019s current outlook on the business (including lower\nprojected growth rates) and extrapolate beyond the projections historically prepared by management in the\nordinary course to include additional years, for use by the Board in evaluating any acquisition proposals and\nto provide the updated long-range projections to Goldman Sachs for its review and preliminary use. The\nBoard determined to reconvene the following week to review the updated long-range projections and have a\npreliminary discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs of their financial implications.\nFollowing the Board meeting, on May 30, 2022, Mr. Durand conveyed to representatives of Thoma Bravo\nthat the Board needed additional time to consider their May Proposal.\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 2, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani held an introductory in-person meeting with representatives of a\nprivate equity firm, which we refer to herein as Party B, who had requested a meeting with the Company,\nduring which Party B expressed its interest in a potential transaction with the Company, and its interest in\nthe identity and cybersecurity industry generally. Messrs. Durand and Dani, and representatives of Party B\ndid not discuss any terms of a potential transaction.\nOn June 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives\nof Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. The Board reviewed the updated long-range financial\nprojections that had been prepared by the Company\u2019s management at the direction of the Board at its May\n27, 2022 meeting (the \u201cJune Projections\u201d). Following discussion, the Board approved those projections for\nuse by Goldman Sachs in its financial analysis (for additional information with respect to just financial\nprojections, see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201c- Certain Financial Projections\u201d).\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs led a discussion with respect to the long-range projections that had been\nprepared by management and the financial implications thereof in light of ongoing market volatility and\nchallenges facing the industry in which the Company operates. The Board and members of management in\nattendance also discussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs potential alternatives to a sale of the\nCompany, including continuing to execute the Company\u2019s standalone plan. At the meeting, the Board\nconsidered and discussed whether the timing was appropriate for a potential sale transaction, including the\nrelative risks and benefits thereof, with the Board focusing on, among other things, the probability of\nconsummating a successful sale at compelling value and the ability of the Company to execute on its\nstandalone plan given challenges facing the industry. After consultation with representatives of Goldman\nSachs, the Board instructed Company management to inform Thoma Bravo that Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposed\nvaluation was insufficient, but that the Board would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with\nThoma Bravo to share certain financial due diligence information in order to enable Thoma Bravo to increase\nits valuation. The Board also instructed the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs\nto conduct outreach to Party A and Party B, who were selected for outreach as the parties most likely to be\ninterested in exploring a transaction with the Company based on their perceived interest in making\ninvestments in the industry in which the Company operates, the fact that they had previously expressed an\ninterest in acquiring the Company and their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size. In\naddition, after reviewing and discussing the June Projections, the Board approved disclosure of the June\nProjections to bidders following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality agreement.\nOn June 4, 2022, Mr. Durand conveyed the Board-directed message to representatives of Thoma Bravo.\nOn June 5, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives\nof Party A and Party B, who had both previously expressed interest in participating in any process in which\nthe Company explored strategic alternatives, to offer them the opportunity to enter into a confidentiality\nagreement and receive certain due diligence information if they were still interested in a potential transaction.\nParty A and Party B both indicated that they were interested in acquiring the Company and requested a copy\nof the confidentiality agreement. Representatives of Party A also informed representatives of Goldman Sachs\nthat they would want to partner with two other financial sponsors (referred to herein as \u201cParty C\u201d and \u201cParty\nD\u201d, respectively, and collectively with Party A, the \u201cConsortium\u201d). Representatives of Goldman Sachs\ninformed Party A that they would discuss this request with the Company.\nOn June 7, 2022, while attending an industry conference, Mr. Durand met with a representative of Thoma\nBravo and discussed the Company and the industry generally. Mr. Durand and the representative of Thoma\nBravo did not discuss any terms of a potential transaction.\nOn June 8, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo. The\nconfidentiality agreement included customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill\nprovision that prohibited Thoma Bravo (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to\nacquire or acquiring the Company, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, in each\ncase without the prior consent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Thoma Bravo to\nmake acquisition proposals at any time after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third\nparty providing for a change of control transaction of the Company. Following execution of the\nconfidentiality agreement, Thoma Bravo was provided access to select financial due diligence information,\nincluding the June Projections.\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 9, 2022, after discussions with management of the Company, representatives of Goldman Sachs\ninformed Party A that the Company would prefer to engage with Party A on a standalone basis and would\nconsider requests to partner with other financial sponsors later in the process. Party A informed\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs that it would need time to consider this request.\nOn June 10, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party B. The confidentiality\nagreement included customary nondisclosure and nonuse provisions and a standstill provision that\nprohibited Party B (for an agreed-upon period) from (among other things) offering to acquire or acquiring the\nCompany, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, in each case without the prior\nconsent of the Company. The confidentiality agreement permitted Party B to make acquisition proposals at\nany time after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party providing for a change of\ncontrol transaction of the Company.

After reviewing the Consortium Proposal and in light of the fact that Party A had already engaged\nin discussions with Party C and Party D, and the Board believed that Party A would be the lead investor of\nthe Consortium, the Board permitted Party A to partner with Parties C and D in connection with a potential\ntransaction and to consider the Consortium Proposal as a joint bid.\nOn June 28, 2022, at the request of Thoma Bravo, management gave an additional presentation to\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo to answer supplemental diligence questions, with representatives of\nGoldman Sachs in attendance.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company\u2019s management gave a presentation to representatives of Party B regarding\nthe Company, with representatives of Goldman Sachs in attendance.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company\u2019s management updated the Board on the status of the current process.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A.

At the meeting, a representative of Kirkland reviewed with the\nBoard its fiduciary duties under Delaware law and discussed certain considerations for the Board when\nevaluating a potential sale of the Company. Management also updated the Board with respect to the\ndiligence sessions that had been conducted to date and a discussion ensued regarding the terms of the May\nProposal, as well as the Consortium Proposal. At the meeting, the Board instructed representatives of\nGoldman Sachs to inform each of Thoma Bravo and the Consortium that they would need to meaningfully\nincrease their prices.\nAfter the Board meeting on July 8, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs\ninformed representatives of Thoma Bravo that they would need to meaningfully increase their price in order\nfor the Board to agree to engage with Thoma Bravo with respect to a transaction.\nOn July 9, 2022, Messrs. Durand and Dani and representatives of Goldman Sachs met with representatives of\nThoma Bravo to discuss and respond to additional financial due diligence questions.\nAlso on July 9, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Party A with selected supplemental financial due\ndiligence materials in response to diligence questions asked by Party A.\nOn July 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding indication of\ninterest to the Board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $28.50 per share,\nrepresenting a 44% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $19.81 as of July 11, 2022, and replaced\nthe \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision previously proposed by Thoma Bravo with a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision (the \u201cJuly 11\nProposal\u201d).\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company\u2019s management updated the Board on the status of the current process,\nincluding receipt of the July 11 Proposal.\nLater on July 12, 2022, Party B informed representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was no longer interested in\npursuing an acquisition of the Company, and the Consortium also indicated to representatives of Goldman\nSachs that it would only be interested in pursuing a transaction at a price below its previous offer, which it\nunderstood was below what the Board would be interested in pursuing, and so would not be submitting a\nrevised proposal. As reasons for their decisions, each of Party B and the Consortium cited the trajectory and\ntiming of the Company\u2019s revenue transition and path to higher margins being longer than it had anticipated.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives\nof Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. The Board discussed the status of the potential transaction,\nincluding the terms of Thoma Bravo\u2019s July 11 Proposal, as well as related process considerations. At the\nmeeting, the Board discussed with its advisors potential strategic alternatives for the Company, including\nthe possibility of soliciting interest from other potential bidders. Members of management shared with the\nBoard their views on the challenges facing the Company, including certain macro-economic headwinds and\ncompleting the cloud transformation in the current environment, and representatives of Goldman Sachs\ndiscussed the potential buyer universe, both as to financial sponsors and strategic companies. The Board\nfurther discussed the fact that each of Thoma Bravo, Party B and the Consortium were highly credible\nbidders and had expressed interest in the Company, as well as the risks of losing Thoma Bravo as the current\nbidder if the Company took additional time to pursue any potential new bidders. Following discussion, the\nBoard determined that, in light of discussions to date with Thoma Bravo, Party B and the Consortium, who\nwere perceived as the most likely potential acquirers of the Company, together with the risks to the Company\nassociated with leaks and a potential failed process, it would not conduct outreach to other potential bidders\nat this time. The Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders to continue\nengagement with Thoma Bravo, and instructed the Company\u2019s management and advisors to continue such\nengagement. Further, at the meeting, the Board determined that it was prepared to agree to include a \u201cno-\nshop\u201d provision in the definitive transaction documents in light of the prior outreach to the parties who were\nbelieved to be the most likely acquirers of the Company, but would only be willing to proceed on that basis if\nThoma Bravo agreed (1) to provide a full\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nequity backstop for the full purchase price to increase closing certainty for the Company, (2) that the\ntermination fee payable by the Company in the event the definitive agreement is terminated to enable the\nCompany to enter into an alternative transaction would be less than 3% of equity value, and (3) to move\nexpeditiously to sign before or concurrently with the Company\u2019s earnings announcement on August 2, 2022.\nThe Board also instructed Goldman Sachs to encourage Thoma Bravo to increase their price, and to ask\nThoma Bravo for a price of $30.00 per share, In addition, the Board resolved to form an ad-hoc transaction\ncommittee (the \u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) for convenience and efficiency, and not to address any potential\nconflicts of interest, and Michael Fosnaugh, Yancey L. Spruill and John McCormack, all of whom had\nsignificant experience with mergers and acquisition transactions, were appointed to the Transaction\nCommittee. The Board authorized the Transaction Committee to assist management with respect to\nnegotiating a possible transaction with Thoma Bravo and to provide timely Board input on issues as they\narose\u037e provided that any potential transaction involving the Company would need to be approved by the full\nBoard.\nLater on July 15, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Goldman Sachs had a phone call with\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo and conveyed to Thoma Bravo that they should increase their price to\n$30.00 per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also informed Thoma Bravo that, subject to an\nagreement on an increased price, the Board was prepared to agree to include a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision in the\ndefinitive transaction documents, but would only be willing to proceed on that basis if Thoma Bravo agreed\n(1) to provide a full equity backstop for the full purchase price to increase closing certainty for the Company,\n(2) that the termination fee payable by the Company in the event the definitive agreement is terminated to\nenable the Company to enter into an alternative transaction would be no higher than 2.9% of equity value\nand (3) that the parties would agree to sign before or concurrently with the Company\u2019s earnings\nannouncement on August 2, 2022.\nOn July 16, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and agreed to\n(i) increase their price to $28.75, noting that it was their \u201cbest and final\u201d price (representing a 61% premium to\nthe Company\u2019s closing share price of $17.86 as of July 15, 2022), (ii) provide a full equity backstop, (iii) a\ntermination fee of 2.9% of equity value, but with additional expense reimbursement, and (iv) move\nexpeditiously to sign by August 2, 2022 (assuming diligence materials were provided). Representatives of\nThoma Bravo also requested exclusivity on these terms. Representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Thoma\nBravo that they did not believe the Board would be willing to entertain exclusivity.\nLater on July 16, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs updated the Transaction Committee on their discussions with Thoma Bravo. Following discussion, the\nTransaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma Bravo that the Company was prepared to\nmove forward on the basis outlined by Thoma Bravo, but that the Company would not agree to exclusivity\nand that any expense reimbursement payable to Thoma Bravo would be capped at $1,500,000.\nOn July 16, 2022, after the Transaction Committee meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo to inform them that the Board was prepared to move forward on the terms\npreviously discussed, subject to agreement that expense reimbursement would be capped at $1,500,000.\nThoma Bravo confirmed that they agreed with these terms and informed Goldman Sachs they would send a\nrevised offer letter reflecting the agreed upon terms.\nLater on July 16, 2022, the Company\u2019s management updated the Board about the status of discussions\nbetween representatives of Goldman Sachs and Thoma Bravo earlier that day.\nOn July 17, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo submitted a further revised non-binding offer letter to the\nBoard to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $28.75 per share, representing a 61%\npremium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of $17.86 as of July 15, 2022, and which letter also contained\nthe other terms that had been agreed by the parties.\nOn July 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo was provided with access to a virtual data room with diligence information\nregarding the Company.\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 21, 2022, representatives of Kirkland sent an initial draft Merger Agreement that had been prepared\nby Kirkland to representatives of Goodwin Procter LLP (\u201cGoodwin\u201d), outside counsel to Thoma Bravo.

A\nrepresentative of Kirkland provided a summary to the Board of the initial draft Merger Agreement provided\nto Thoma Bravo. At the meeting, the Board reviewed Goldman Sachs\u2019 relationship disclosure letter, and\ndetermined that no such conflicts would affect the ability of Goldman Sachs to fulfill its responsibilities as\nfinancial advisor to the Company.\nOn July 23, 2022, the Company and Goldman Sachs executed an engagement letter.\nOn July 25, 2022, representatives of Goodwin sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to\nrepresentatives of Kirkland, and between July 26, 2022 and August 2, 2022, representatives of Kirkland and\nGoodwin, on behalf of the Company and Thoma Bravo, respectively, exchanged drafts of the Merger\nAgreement and conducted a number of conference calls regarding the draft Merger Agreement.

Representatives of Thoma Bravo also mentioned that the financing markets were more difficult than\nanticipated and were putting pressure on Thoma Bravo\u2019s valuation of the Company, but did not propose any\nspecific changes to the terms of the deal at that time.\n39 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 31, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Durand and informed him that, as a\nresult of difficult and worsening conditions in the financing market, Thoma Bravo was no longer willing to\nproceed at the previously agreed price of $28.75 per share and was reducing its offer to $26.75 per share. Mr.\nDurand responded that he would convey the reduced offer price to the Board, but did not believe there\nwould be interest in pursuing a transaction on these revised terms.\nFollowing that call, on July 31, 2022, Mr. Durand discussed the revised proposal from Thoma Bravo with the\nTransaction Committee, and the Transaction Committee instructed Mr. Durand to convey to the senior\nrepresentative of Thoma Bravo that the Company was not interested in pursuing a transaction on those\nterms.\nAlso on July 31, 2022, as a result of Thoma Bravo\u2019s reduction in valuation, the Company instructed its\nadvisors not to engage with Thoma Bravo\u2019s representatives or advisors.\nLater on July 31, 2022, Mr. Durand and a senior representative of Thoma Bravo had a subsequent\nconversation during which Mr. Durand informed the senior representative of Thoma Bravo that the Company\nwas not interested in pursuing a transaction at $26.75. The senior representative of Thoma Bravo then\nreiterated that Thoma Bravo had encountered difficulties in the financing market and that, although they\nremained interested in the Company, would no longer be able to move forward at the previously agreed price,\nbut that they would be open to meeting in the middle between Thoma Bravo\u2019s revised offer of $26.75 and the\npreviously agreed upon price of $28.75, and suggested a $1 reduction in purchase price as a possible\nsolution. Mr. Durand stated that he would convey the message to the Board.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nmembers of the Company\u2019s management updated the Transaction Committee on conversations with\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo.

Thoma Bravo reiterated that due to difficulties in the financing market, they were unable\nto proceed at the previously agreed price, and noted that they would only move forward if there was some\nmovement to a price below $28.75.\nLater on August 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee held another meeting, with members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs updated the Transaction Committee on their conversations with Thoma Bravo with respect to\nvaluation. Following discussion, the Transaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma\nBravo that the Company would be willing to agree to a price of $28.50 per share but only if certain remaining\nopen provisions in the Merger Agreement are resolved in favor of the Company\u2019s position, including those\nrelated to the efforts Thoma Bravo was required to take to obtain regulatory approvals and a commitment\nfrom Thoma Bravo not to enter into transactions that would reasonably be expected to delay consummation\nof the Merger. The Transaction Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Thoma Bravo that the\nCompany would not be interested in any transaction below this price, and that if Thoma Bravo was not\nprepared to move forward to sign an agreement on that basis the Company would move forward on a\nstandalone basis, and continue to execute on its current plan.\nFollowing the second Transaction Committee meeting, on August 1, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs\ncalled representatives of Thoma Bravo to deliver the Transaction Committee\u2019s message. Thoma Bravo\nresponded by indicating that a $0.25 reduction in purchase price was insufficient, but stated that they would\nbe willing to proceed at a $0.50 reduction, which equated to a price of $28.25 per share. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs informed representatives of Thoma Bravo that the Transaction Committee was unwilling to\nagree to a price below its previous offer of $28.50 per share.\nLater on August 1, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo called representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nagreed to the price of $28.50 per share, representing a 66% premium to the Company\u2019s closing share price of\n$17.17 as of August 1, 2022, and agreed to resolve the open issues largely in the manner proposed by the\n40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany. Following the agreement to proceed on these terms, the Company instructed its advisors to\nengage with Thoma Bravo\u2019s advisors to finalize the transaction documents before the Company\u2019s earnings\nannouncement on the morning of August 3, 2022 and representatives of Goodwin, on behalf of Thoma Bravo,\nand Kirkland, on behalf of the Company, engaged in numerous calls and exchanged revised drafts of the\nMerger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, Limited Guaranty, Voting Agreement, Company disclosure\nletter and other transaction documents.\nAlso on August 1, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance.

Representatives of Goldman\nSachs reviewed their financial analysis with the Board (which were based on the June Projections, but\nupdated to account for the completion of the second quarter of 2022, as more fully described in the section\nof this proxy statement titled \u201c- Certain Financial Projections\u201d), noting that they would be prepared when\nrequested by the Board to deliver an opinion that, based upon and subject to the various assumptions that\nwould be set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to the holders (other than\nParent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair\nfrom a financial point of view to such holders. Representatives of Kirkland discussed with the Board its\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with the potential transaction, and summarized the terms\nof the draft Merger Agreement, including with respect to (i) the efforts Thoma Bravo was required to take to\nobtain regulatory approvals and that before receipt of required antitrust approvals Thoma Bravo was\nprohibited from entering into transactions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay\nreceipt of required antitrust approvals for the transaction, (ii) the amount of the termination fee payable by\nthe Company in certain circumstances, and (iii) the limitation on damages payable by either party under the\nMerger Agreement, including the cap on damages payable by Thoma Bravo of 7% of equity value. The Board\ndiscussed the price and other terms of the Merger Agreement, including the importance of the full equity\nbackstop and antitrust efforts covenants to enhance certainty of closing, and indicated its support for a\ntransaction on those terms.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Board held a meeting with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered\nto the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nAugust 2, 2022, to the effect that, as of August 2, 2022, and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to the holders (other\nthan Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was\nfair from a financial point of view to such holders. Goldman Sachs\u2019s opinion is more fully described in the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201c- Opinion of Goldman Sachs.\u201d\nOn the evening of August 2, 2022, following prior discussion and consideration of the Merger Agreement\nand the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the factors described in the\nsection titled \u201c- Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board\u201d), the members of the Board, by\nunanimous action by written consent: (1) determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) approved the execution and\ndelivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and\nother obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth therein\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger\nAgreement in accordance with the DGCL\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted for consideration by the stockholders of the Company at a meeting thereof.

that the price of $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate\nvalue and liquidity to Ping Identity stockholders\u037e\nthe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock, including the fact that the $28.50 per share to be received by Ping Identity\nstockholders in the Merger represents a premium of approximately 63% over the closing price per\nshare as of August 2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger, and\napproximately 52% over the volume weighted average price per share for the 60 days ending August\n2, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger\u037e\nthe current and prospective business environment in which Ping Identity operates, including\ninternational, national and local economic conditions, the current environment in the enterprise\nidentity security industry, and the likely effect of these factors on Ping Identity and the execution of\nPing Identity\u2019s plans as a standalone public company\u037e\nthe fact that Ping Identity is undergoing a Software as a Service and platform transformation and is\nsubject to market challenges and unpredictability in connection with such transition, as well as\nincreased exposure to variability in GAAP accounting results which could expose investors to\nincreased volatility in trading prices\u037e\nthe belief that the $28.50 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to Ping Identity\nstockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives\nreasonably available to Ping Identity, based upon the directors\u2019 extensive knowledge of Ping\nIdentity\u2019s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, the challenges completing\nthe cloud transformation in the current macro-economic environment, Ping Identity\u2019s historical and\nprojected financial performance, and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an\nattractive and comparatively certain value for Ping Identity stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted\nprospects for Ping Identity on a standalone basis\u037e\nthe belief that the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing Ping Identity\u2019s\nstockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the Merger (including possible\nalternative business combinations and scenarios involving the possibility of remaining a standalone\npublicly traded company), and the timing, risks and likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives,\ntaking into account the Board\u2019s belief that there were likely no other potential strategic purchasers or\nother parties that would be reasonably likely to engage in a transaction in the near term at a price\ngreater than the price being offered by Thoma Bravo\u037e\nthe process conducted by Ping Identity, with the assistance of its advisors, to review other potential\nstrategic alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with numerous counterparties\nregarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Ping Identity\u037e\nthe fact that Ping Identity entered into confidentiality agreements with three potential bidders (or\ngroups of bidders), and that Thoma Bravo was the only party to submit a final offer to acquire Ping\nIdentity\u037e\n42 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Thoma Bravo in the event Ping Identity\nsought to pursue discussions with other third parties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic\ntransaction with Ping Identity prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential negative\neffect that such a process might have on Ping Identity\u2019s business\u037e\nthe business reputation, experience, expertise and capabilities of Thoma Bravo, and its strong track\nrecord of investing in high-growth cloud software security business and supporting companies with\ninitiatives to turbocharge innovation and open new markets\u037e\nthe belief that, after negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as described in more\ndetail under the section titled \u201c- Background of the Merger\u201d), $28.50 per share was the highest price\nthat Thoma Bravo was willing to pay as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and that\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Ping Identity, in the\naggregate, to which Thoma Bravo would be willing to agree\u037e\nthe belief that, if Ping Identity did not enter into the Merger Agreement with Thoma Bravo, there\ncould be a considerable period of time before the trading price per share of Ping Identity\u2019s common\nstock would reach and sustain the per share merger consideration of $28.50, as

dated August 2, 2022, to the effect that, as of August 2, 2022, and based upon and subject to\nthe various assumptions set forth therein, the per share consideration of $28.50 in cash to be paid to\nthe holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Ping Identity common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully

In light of the variety of factors considered in\nconnection with their evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board and the\nTransaction Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank or\nassign relative weights to the various factors considered in reaching their respective determinations. In\nconsidering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of the Board and the\nTransaction Committee may have viewed factors differently or given different weight, merit or consideration\nto different factors. In addition, the Board and the Transaction Committee did not undertake to make any\nspecific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was\nfavorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Board or the Transaction Committee, but rather\nthe Board and the Transaction Committee conducted an overall review of the factors described above,\nincluding discussions with Ping Identity\u2019s senior management and legal and financial advisors.\nThe foregoing discussion of the reasoning of the Board and the Transaction Committee and certain\ninformation presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be\nread in light of the factors discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs\nAt a meeting of the Ping Identity Board held on August 2, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated August 2, 2022, that, as of the date of the written\nopinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.50 in cash per\nshare of Ping Identity common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such\nshares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to holders of such shares.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 2, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is\nattached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of\nthe Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as\nto how any holder of Ping Identity common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter. You\nshould read the opinion carefully in its entirety.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,\nGoldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\nthe annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the three\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\u037e\n45 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe registration statement on Form S-1 of the Company, dated August 23, 2019, as amended, including\nthe prospectus contained therein, relating to the registration and resale of Ping Identity common\nstock\u037e\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company\u037e\ncertain other communications from the Company to its stockholders\u037e\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company\u037e and\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management as\napproved for the use of Goldman Sachs by the Company (the \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d) including\ncertain analyses prepared by the management of the Company related to the expected utilization by\nthe Company of certain net operating loss carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards of the\nCompany, as approved for our use by the Company (the \u201cTax Attributes Forecasts\u201d) (please see the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-",

Instead, the Company will remain an independent public\ncompany, the Ping Identity common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE, the Ping\nIdentity common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will continue to\nfile periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to its common stock and the Company\u2019s\nstockholders will continue to own their shares of Ping Identity common stock and will continue to be subject\nto the same general risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of Ping Identity\ncommon stock.\nIf the Merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the\nfuture value of your shares of Ping Identity common stock, including the risk that the market price of Ping\nIdentity common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of Ping Identity common stock\nreflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there is no\nassurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business,\noperations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of the Company will not be adversely\n57 ",

Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder, the Merger may not be completed until notifications have been filed and certain information has\nbeen furnished to the FTC and the DOJ and the specified waiting period has expired or has been terminated.\nThe Company and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act\nwith the DOJ and the FTC on August 8, 2022.

Both before and after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the\nDOJ retain the authority to challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds.\nIn addition, the Merger may be reviewed by the state attorneys general in the various states in which Parent\nand the Company operate. These authorities may claim that there is authority, under the applicable state and\nfederal antitrust laws and regulations, to investigate and/or seek to prohibit the Merger under the\ncircumstances and based on the standards set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. There can be no\nassurance that one or more state attorneys general will not attempt to file an antitrust action to challenge the\nMerger. As of the date of this proxy statement, neither Parent nor the Company has been notified by any\nstate attorney general indicating any plan to review the Merger.\nOther Regulatory Notifications\nThe consummation of the Merger is also conditioned upon the clearance or approval by the antitrust\nauthorities in certain other jurisdictions and other relevant authorities under foreign investment laws. The\nMerger cannot be completed until Ping Identity and Parent obtain clearance to consummate the Merger or\nthe applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurances that all of the required regulatory approvals will be obtained and, if obtained,\nthere can be no assurances as to the timing of any approvals.\nThe Merger Agreement includes covenants obligating each of the parties, with respect to filings under the\nHSR Act and foreign regulatory laws, to supply (or cause to be supplied) information that may be required to\nmake such filings or any additional information that may be requested by the FTC, DOJ, or other\ngovernmental authorities in which such a filing is made, to cooperate and coordinate (and to cause their\n69 ",

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either a record\nholder or a beneficial owner of Ping Identity common stock, provided such person has complied with the\nrequirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the surviving\ncorporation must commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nwith a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder or beneficial\nowner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of Ping Identity common stock held by all\nstockholders who have properly demanded appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to\nfile an appraisal petition and has no present intention of doing so. If you desire to have your shares\nappraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the\ntime periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the\nprovisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written\nrequest, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Ping Identity common stock not voted\nin favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Ping Identity has received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The surviving corporation must\nmail this statement to you within the later of (1) ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the\nrequest therefor or (2) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are\nthe beneficial owner of shares of Ping Identity common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or\nintermediary on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the\nsurviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph.\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of Ping Identity\ncommon stock who has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving\ncorporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders\nwho have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares\nhave not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine\nwhich stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal\nwho hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation\nthereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the\nproceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. The Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill also dismiss proceedings as to all Ping Identity stockholders if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above is met. Where proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not\nsuccessfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of Ping Identity\ncommon stock owned by such stockholders, in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will\nthereafter determine the fair value of the shares of Ping Identity common stock at the Effective Time held by\nall Ping Identity stockholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the\nDelaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\nEffective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at\n5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving\ncorporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder entitled to appraisal. If the surviving\ncorporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, interest\nwill accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving\ncorporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and (2) interest accrued on the amount of the voluntary cash payment before such\npayment was made, unless such interest was paid at the time the voluntary cash payment is\n102 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmade. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value,\nless any amounts already paid in a voluntary cash payment, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders\nof Ping Identity entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon\nsurrender by certificated stockholders of their stock certificates.\nIn determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant\nfactors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise\nadmissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all\nrelevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must\nconsider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfactors which were known, or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be\n\u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede &\nCo. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of\nvalue arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court\nconstrued Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the\nenterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of\nspeculation, may be considered.\u201d\nYou should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Ping Identity common stock as determined under\nSection 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to\nreceive under the terms of the Merger Agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the\nfairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and\ndoes not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nMoreover, neither Ping Identity nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share price to any Ping\nIdentity stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for\npurposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Ping Identity common stock is less than the per share\nprice. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery.\nIf no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the Effective Time or if neither of the ownership\nthresholds above has been satisfied in respect of such shares, then all Ping Identity stockholders will lose\nthe right to an appraisal and will instead receive the per share price described in the Merger Agreement,\nwithout interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those\ncosts to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances.\nEach Ping Identity stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for its own attorneys\u2019 fees\nand expert witnesses\u2019 fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Ping Identity common stock entitled to\nappraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and award pursuant to a\nreservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\nIf you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after\nthe Effective Time, vote the shares subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other\ndistributions on those shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Ping\nIdentity common stock as of a record date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may\nwithdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the per share price by delivering a written withdrawal of\n103 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger to the surviving corporation, except that any\nattempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the\nsurviving corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as\nto any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be\nconditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this provision\nwill not affect the right of any Ping Identity stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms and the Merger Consideration offered in the\nMerger within 60 days after the Effective Time. If you fail to perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for\nappraisal, or lose the appraisal right, your shares of Ping Identity common stock will be converted into the\nright to receive the per share price, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.\nFailure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your\nshares of Ping Identity common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement without interest. In view of\nthe complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are a Ping Identity stockholder and are\nconsidering exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and\nfinancial advisor.\nThe process of demanding and exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with the prerequisites of Section 262\nof the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your own legal and financial\nadvisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies\nbetween the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL will govern.\n104 \n",
