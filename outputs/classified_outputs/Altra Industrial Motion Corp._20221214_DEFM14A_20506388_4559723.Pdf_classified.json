They will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Altra common stock following\npetition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Altra\ncommon stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled\nto receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Company\u2019s management and the Board regularly review the Company\u2019s performance and prospects in light of its business and developments\nin the electromechanical power transmission motion control industry. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential\npartnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions and opportunities to enhance stockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such\nreviews have been accompanied by periodic conversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in such\nindustry regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.\n \n34Table of Contents\nOn March 11, 2022, during a Manufacturers Alliance CEO Council conference in Pentagon City, Virginia, Louis V. Pinkham, Chief Executive Officer\nof Regal Rexnord, and Carl R. Christenson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, met and discussed the possibility of having dinner to\ndiscuss their respective businesses.\nOn April 4, 2022, in light of the significant industry consolidation that had occurred during 2021, the Company\u2019s strong position in the industry,\nand the upcoming dinner with Regal Rexnord, Mr. Christenson contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs and asked that they attend the Company\u2019s\nnext regularly scheduled Board meeting on April 25, 2022, and provide the Board with an overview of the market and key considerations if the Company\nbecame the target of activism or an unsolicited offer.\nOn April 13, 2022, Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson met for dinner, at the end of which Mr. Pinkham raised the possibility of a business\ncombination between the Company and Regal Rexnord. Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson did not discuss a possible price or other terms. Mr. Christensen\nindicated that he would take the matter back to the Board for review. Following the dinner, Mr. Christenson informed Lyle G. Ganske, the Company\u2019s lead\nindependent director, of Regal Rexnord\u2019s potential interest.\nOn April 25, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, met in person in\nBlacksburg, VA. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the market, strategic alternatives and key considerations in the context\nof activism or an unsolicited offer. In an executive session attended by only the Board, Mr. Christenson informed the Board of Regal Rexnord\u2019s potential\ninterest in a business combination with the Company and described his conversations with Mr. Pinkham to date. Following discussion, the Board\ndetermined that a sale of the Company at that time was not in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders due to the fact that the Company\u2019s\nstock price was undervalued at that time relative to recent average trading prices as a result of the broad downturn in U.S. equity markets.\nDuring the month of May, Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham had three telephonic conversations during which Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham\ndiscussed the possibility of a proposal and the Board\u2019s decision that a sale of the Company at that time was not in the best interest of the Company and\nits stockholders.\nOn August 23, 2022, Mr. Pinkham emailed Mr. Christenson with a request for a call.\nOn August 26, 2022, Mr. Pinkham and Mr. Christenson spoke telephonically during which Mr. Pinkham asked to meet with Mr. Christenson and\nindicated that he planned to provide Mr. Christenson with a written proposal to combine Regal Rexnord and the Company. Mr. Christenson promptly\ninformed Mr. Ganske and representatives of Goldman Sachs of these discussions and a meeting date was agreed.\nOn August 29, 2022, Mr. Pinkham met with Mr. Christenson and provided him with a Letter of Intent (the \u201cOffer Letter\u201d) containing a preliminary\nnon-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding Company common stock at a price of $60.70 per share in cash (the \u201cAugust 29\nProposal\u201d), representing a 56.9% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $38.69 on August 29, 2022, the last trading day prior to\nthe August 29 Proposal, and a 60.2% premium to the Company\u2019s 90-day-volume-weighted average share price of $37.90 as of the same day. The Offer\nLetter also stated that Regal Rexnord\u2019s proposal had the support of its Board of Directors and management team, that Regal Rexnord had retained legal\nand financial advisors, and that the acquisition would be funded by a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing, to be arranged by J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC on the terms set forth in a highly confident letter attached to the Offer Letter. Mr. Christenson told Mr. Pinkham that he would\ndiscuss the August 29 Proposal with the Board but that the Company was currently not for sale, and any potential transaction would need to be at a\nhigher price, without the Company bearing meaningful consummation risk.\nOn September 1, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company\u2019s management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, Swaine &\nMoore LLP (\u201cCravath\u201d), outside counsel to the Company, met virtually\n \n \n35\nTable of Contents\nto discuss the August 29 Proposal. Mr. Christenson provided the Board with an update regarding the August 29 Proposal, including a summary of the\ninteractions between Mr. Christenson and Mr. Pinkham to date and a review of views as to why Regal Rexnord was likely to be willing and able to pay a\nhigher price than any other potentially interested party, and discussed with the Board potential next steps to be taken by the Company in response to the\nAugust 29 Proposal. A representative of Cravath reviewed with the Board their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, including in the context of the\nAugust 29 Proposal, and representatives of Goldman Sachs provided the Board with a preliminary overview of the August 29 Proposal. The Board\nscheduled a subsequent meeting for September 8, 2022 and requested that the Company\u2019s management work with Goldman Sachs to perform a preliminary\nfinancial analysis of the August 29 Proposal prior to such meeting.\nOn September 8, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met\nvirtually. During this meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs presented its preliminary financial analysis of the August 29 Proposal based on pre-\nexisting financial projections provided by the Company\u2019s management. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then discussed certain strategic\nconsiderations, including the possibility of and considerations regarding conducting a \u201cmarket check\u201d to gauge third-party interest in an acquisition of\nthe Company. Following discussion with representatives of Goldman Sachs, Cravath and the Company\u2019s management, the Board determined that\ncontacting alternative bidders for the Company would not be in the best interest of Altra stockholders in light of the risks that a \u201cmarket check\u201d would\nentail, including concerns that market leaks or rumors regarding a potential transaction could disrupt the Company\u2019s business relationships, increase\nemployee turnover, increase turnover in the Company\u2019s stockholder base and result in potential stock price volatility. The Board also considered the fact\nthat there were a limited number of potential counterparties that might have an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a strategic\ntransaction with the Company at a value higher than Regal Rexnord\u2019s offer, that the recent deterioration of the credit and equity markets threatened the\nprospects of any transaction, including one with Regal Rexnord, and that guiding Regal Rexnord to make a \u201cpreemptive offer\u201d (i.e., an offer on terms that\nwere sufficiently attractive that the Board would conclude that engaging in discussions on a bilateral basis with Regal Rexnord was in the best interest of\nAltra stockholders) presented the best opportunity to maximize value for Altra stockholders. As a result, the Board determined that it was in the best\ninterest of the Company and its stockholders to engage with Regal Rexnord regarding a potential transaction, but that any definitive agreement must\nprovide for a high degree of closing certainty, contain a termination fee that would not deter competing bids and a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision that would permit\nthe Company to engage in negotiations with third parties regarding potentially superior proposals while under a binding contract with Regal Rexnord.\nThe Board then authorized the Company\u2019s management to inform Regal Rexnord that the August 29 Proposal was insufficient and that improved terms\nwould be a condition to further discussions regarding a potential transaction but that, upon execution of a confidentiality agreement, the Company would\nprovide Regal Rexnord with limited high-level information to enable Regal Rexnord to improve its offer price.\nLater on September 8, 2022, Mr. Christenson and Mr. Ganske informed Mr. Pinkham that the Board had determined that the August 29 Proposal was\ninsufficient from a financial perspective, but that, following the execution by Regal Rexnord of a customary confidentiality agreement, Mr. Christenson\nand a limited number of other members of senior management of the Company would make themselves available for a meeting to help Regal Rexnord learn\nabout the Company in order to facilitate an increase in Regal Rexnord\u2019s offer price. Mr. Christenson and Mr. Ganske also informed Mr. Pinkham that the\nBoard was not prepared to accept any meaningful consummation risk.\nOn September 9, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of Cravath provided a draft confidentiality agreement to representatives of\nSidley Austin LLP, Regal Rexnord\u2019s outside legal counsel (\u201cSidley\u201d), which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of the\nCompany, Regal Rexnord, Cravath and Sidley, with particular focus on the duration and other terms of the standstill provision.\nOn September 10, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors sent representatives of Goldman\nSachs an initial due diligence request list.\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nOn September 18, 2022, Mr. Christenson informed Mr. Pinkham that the Company was willing to agree to a six-month standstill in the confidentiality\nagreement but reemphasized that the Company expected that, following further due diligence, Regal Rexnord would improve its offer price and that any\nmerger agreement would contain terms consistent with the Company\u2019s position that it would not take any meaningful consummation risk. Mr. Pinkham\nindicated he understood the Company\u2019s position, and the confidentiality agreement was executed later that day.\nOn September 19, 2022, members of the Company\u2019s management team, representatives of Goldman Sachs, members of Regal Rexnord\u2019s management\nteam, and representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors met in person in Boston, and the Company\u2019s management delivered a presentation on,\namong other things, operational and management highlights, growth strategies, overviews of its financial performance and projections, and preliminary\nviews on potential synergies.\nOn September 20, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors sent a supplemental due diligence\nrequest list to representatives of Goldman Sachs. Over the course of the next several weeks, Regal Rexnord and its representatives conducted due\ndiligence on Altra, including by way of diligence calls and documentary review.\nOn September 21, 2022, representatives of the Company met virtually with representatives of Cravath to discuss Regal Rexnord\u2019s supplemental due\ndiligence request list and the scope of non-public information that the Company was willing to provide prior to receipt of a revised offer. Later that day, at\nthe direction of the Company, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Regal Rexnord and its representatives with access to the Company\u2019s virtual\ndata room in order to enable Regal Rexnord to improve its offer price. From time to time, representatives of the Company uploaded additional documents\nto the Company\u2019s virtual data room and representatives of Regal Rexnord reviewed these documents in the course of their due diligence.\nOn September 22, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company\u2019s management, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of\nCravath, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the in-person management meeting that had occurred on September 19 and updated financial\nprojections refined by the Company\u2019s management, reflecting certain updates since the prior Board meeting on September 8. A letter from Goldman Sachs\nregarding Goldman Sachs\u2019 relationships with the Company and Regal Rexnord was then reviewed with the Board. A general update and discussion\nregarding next steps followed. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company would permit Regal Rexnord to conduct further due\ndiligence in order to enable it to improve its offer price and that Cravath would send a draft merger agreement to Sidley to be negotiated concurrently.\nOn September 23, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Sidley, which included, among other terms, a\n\u201chell or high water\u201d regulatory standard. The draft also included a right for Altra to terminate the Merger Agreement if it received an unsolicited\ncompeting proposal financially superior to the Merger and Regal Rexnord declined to match such superior proposal after being offered an opportunity to\ndo so, subject to Altra paying a termination fee (a \u201ccompany termination fee\u201d) for an undetermined amount. The draft provided limited cooperation\nobligations for Altra in connection with Regal Rexnord\u2019s financing, but no marketing period for Regal Rexnord to obtain such financing.\nOn September 26, 2022, the Company held a financial diligence call with Regal Rexnord during which the updated 2022 financial projections were\nshared.\nOn October 4, 2022, Mr. Pinkham spoke telephonically with Mr. Christenson to reaffirm Regal Rexnord\u2019s previous non-binding proposal to acquire\n100% of the outstanding equity of the Company at a price of $60.70 per share in cash (the \u201cOctober 4 Proposal\u201d), representing a 73.8% premium to the\nclosing price for shares of Altra common stock of $34.93 on October 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the October 4 Proposal. Later that day, the\nOctober 4 Proposal was delivered to the Company in a letter, which requested that, in order to finalize a transaction efficiently and maintain strict\nconfidentiality, the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement\n \n37\nTable of Contents\nproviding for exclusivity until 11:59 p.m. Central Time on October 24, 2022, with an automatic one-week extension if negotiations continued in good faith.\nLater that day, representatives of Sidley sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Cravath that included, among other things, a\nmarketing period, a proposed company termination fee of 3.5% of transaction equity value and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that\nRegal Rexnord\u2019s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude\nactions that relate to assets or businesses (of Regal Rexnord or the Company) that contributed to the generation of $100 million or more of revenue from\nthird-party sales in calendar year 2021.\nOn October 5, 2022, the Board, along with members of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath, met\nvirtually to discuss the October 4 Proposal, the revised draft merger agreement and next steps. Management of the Company and representatives of\nGoldman Sachs reviewed with the Board the Company\u2019s interactions with Regal Rexnord since the prior Board meeting on September 22, 2022.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of the October 4 Proposal and macroeconomic developments, including in the credit\nmarkets. Next, representatives of Cravath presented an overview of the key legal terms of the draft merger agreement proposed by Regal Rexnord.\nFollowing discussion, the Board determined that the October 4 Proposal remained insufficient from a financial perspective and that certain of the\nproposed terms of the revised merger agreement were unacceptable, including with respect to closing certainty, the restrictions on the ability of Altra to\nengage in discussions with parties that submitted an unsolicited proposal after signing and the company termination fee. The Board then directed Mr.\nChristenson, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Cravath to inform Regal Rexnord and its representatives that the Company was willing to accept a\nrevised offer of $63.00 per share if Regal Rexnord agreed to bear all regulatory risk associated with the transaction and to improve certain other terms of\nits offer.\nLater that day, Mr. Christenson spoke telephonically with Mr. Pinkham to communicate that the Company was willing to accept a revised offer of\n$63.00 per share if Regal Rexnord agreed to bear all regulatory risk associated with the transaction and improved certain other terms of its offer, including\nthe company termination fee and the terms of the \u201cno shop\u201d provision (the \u201cOctober 5 Counterproposal\u201d). Representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nCravath subsequently discussed the October 5 Counterproposal with representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors and Sidley, respectively,\nduring which discussion Cravath proposed a company termination fee of 1.75% of transaction equity value.\nOn October 6, 2022, Mr. Pinkham spoke telephonically with Mr. Christenson to deliver a revised non-binding proposal, which consisted of an offer\nto acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company at a price of $61.50 per share in cash, a company termination fee of 2.8% of transaction equity\nvalue and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that Regal Rexnord\u2019s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain\nregulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s Power Transmission Technologies segment (the \u201cOctober 6 Proposal\u201d). The October 6\nProposal represented a 65.9% premium to the closing price for shares of Altra common stock of $37.07 on October 5, 2022, the last trading day prior to the\nOctober 6 Proposal.\nOn October 7, 2022, the Company delivered a verbal counteroffer proposing an offer price of $62.25 per share, a company termination fee of 2.0% of\ntransaction equity value, a reverse termination fee, which would be payable by Regal Rexnord if certain specified regulatory-related closing conditions\nwere not met (a \u201creverse termination fee\u201d), of 7.5% of transaction equity value and a revised position on regulatory commitments, such that Regal\nRexnord\u2019s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would exclude those\nactions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Regal Rexnord and its\nsubsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the transaction.\nAlso, on October 7, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors that Altra was\nconcerned that Regal Rexnord\u2019s regulatory standard in the October 6 Proposal\n \n38\nTable of Contents\ncould allocate meaningful regulatory risk to Altra. In response, following discussions with and at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal\nRexnord\u2019s financial advisors spoke telephonically with representatives of Goldman Sachs to deliver a revised proposal on regulatory commitments, such\nthat Regal Rexnord\u2019s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction would\nexclude actions that relate to assets or businesses (of Regal Rexnord or the Company) that contributed to the generation of $200 million or more of\nrevenue from third-party sales in calendar year 2021, and otherwise reaffirm the October 6 Proposal, including a company termination fee of 2.8% of\ntransaction equity value. Representatives of Goldman Sachs promptly relayed information regarding the discussion to Mr. Christenson.\nOn October 8, 2022, Mr. Christenson, Mr. Ganske and representatives of Cravath discussed next steps in light of Regal Rexnord\u2019s revised proposal,\nincluding a range of potential counterproposals by the Company. Following such discussion, Mr. Christenson spoke with representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Cravath and instructed Cravath to convey the Company\u2019s counterproposal to Sidley, as well as to discuss other key outstanding issues in the\ndraft merger agreement.\nLater that day, representatives of Cravath and representatives of Sidley telephonically discussed certain unresolved business and legal issues.\nCravath conveyed that, if Regal Rexnord increased its offer to $62.25 per share and accepted a company termination fee of 2.0% of transaction equity\nvalue and a reverse termination fee of 6.5% of transaction equity value, the Company would be willing to revise its position on regulatory commitments,\nsuch that Regal Rexnord\u2019s obligation to take or agree to take actions in order to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction\nwould exclude those actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Regal\nRexnord and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the transaction (with Regal Rexnord deemed to be the same size as the Company and\nits subsidiaries, taken as a whole).\nOn October 9, 2022, at the direction of Regal Rexnord, representatives of Regal Rexnord\u2019s financial advisors spoke telephonically with\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs to deliver a revised proposal consisting of an offer price of $61.50 per share, a company termination fee of 2.8% of\ntransaction equity value, a reverse termination fee of 4.5% of transaction equity value and the regulatory commitments position proposed by Cravath the\nprior day (the \u201cOctober 9 Proposal\u201d).

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board has unanimously: (a) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and\nthe consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e (b) declared that the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Altra and its stockholders\u037e (c) directed that\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by Altra stockholders at the Special Meeting\u037e and (d) resolved to recommend that\nAltra stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e\nand (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nAs described above in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d, prior to and in reaching its unanimous determination to authorize and\napprove the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger advisable and in the\nbest interests of the Company and stockholders of the Company and recommend that the Company\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the\nBoard consulted with and received the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company\u2019s management and\nconsidered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including,\namong other things, the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):\n \n\u2022\nMerger Consideration\u037e Premium to the Trading Price of Altra Common Stock. The Board considered the current and historical market\nprices of Altra common stock, including the market performance of Altra common stock relative to those of other participants in the\nCompany\u2019s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $62.00 per share of Altra common stock\nrepresented a:\n \n\u2022\n57% premium to the trading price at which Altra common stock closed on October 25, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Board\u2019s\napproval of the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\n73% premium to the volume weighted average price for Altra common stock over the 30-trading day period ended October 25, 2022,\nthe last trading day that closed prior to the Board\u2019s approval of the Merger\u037e and\n \n\u2022\n0.4% premium to the highest closing price in the 52-week period ended October 25, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to the\nBoard\u2019s approval of the Merger.\n \n41Table of Contents\n\u2022\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which will provide Altra\nstockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Altra common stock, enables Altra stockholders to realize value\nthat has been created by Altra and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions, as\ncompared to Altra remaining independent.\n \n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition and Committed Debt Financing. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing\ncondition, that Regal Rexnord obtained committed debt financing for the Merger from a reputable financing source and that Regal Rexnord\nand Merger Sub have represented in the Merger Agreement that proceeds from such financing will, in the aggregate and together with any\ncash or other funds available to Regal Rexnord or Merger Sub, be sufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid in connection with, or as\na result of, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nLack of Potential Counterparties. The Board considered the fact that there were a limited number of potential counterparties that might\nhave an interest in, and be financially capable of, engaging in a strategic transaction with Altra at a value higher than Regal Rexnord\u2019s offer\nand the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection with pursuing such a transaction. For a detailed\ndiscussion of the Board\u2019s assessment of potential counterparties, please see above under the heading entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the\nMerger\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nRisk Associated with a \u201cMarket Check\u201d. The Board considered the fact that contacting other potential counterparties prior to signing a\ndefinitive agreement with Regal Rexnord would result in significant risks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market\nleaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the Company\u2019s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well\nas lead to turnover in the Company\u2019s stockholder base and potential stock price volatility, and concerns that Regal Rexnord could withdraw\nfrom consideration of a potential transaction if Altra were to pursue other potential counterparties, including as a result of a downturn in the\ncredit markets. For a detailed discussion of the Board\u2019s consideration of a \u201cmarket check\u201d, please see above under the heading entitled\n\u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Board considered the Company\u2019s operating and financial\nperformance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company\u2019s senior management,\nwhich reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management. The Board considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving\nsenior management\u2019s prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading entitled \u201c\u2014Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d, and that as a result\nthe Company\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially from senior management\u2019s forecasts.\n \n\u2022\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a review of a range of alternatives and discussions with management and the\nCompany\u2019s financial and legal advisors, the Board determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to the stockholders of the\nCompany than the potential value that might result from other options available, including, but not limited to, remaining a standalone public\ncompany. As part of these evaluations, the Board considered an assessment of the Company\u2019s business, assets, prospects, competitive\nposition, historical and projected financial performance, short- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in which the\nCompany competes as well as the significant risks and uncertainties associated with remaining a standalone public company.\n \n\u2022\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Fairness Opinion and Related Financial Analyses. Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of October\n26, 2022, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $62.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders\n(other than Regal Rexnord and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such\nholders. For a detailed discussion of Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, please see below in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Opinion of\nGoldman Sachs\u201d. The written opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.\n \n42\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nNegotiation Process. The Board considered its belief that, after extensive negotiations, the Company obtained the highest price that Regal\nRexnord is willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company\u2019s ability to increase the Merger Consideration relative to Regal\nRexnord\u2019s initial offer of $60.70 per share of Altra common stock. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger were the result\nof robust arm\u2019s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge of and at the direction of the Board, with the\nassistance of experienced financial and legal advisors. For a detailed discussion of the negotiation process, please see above under the\nheading entitled \u201c\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nTiming of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger and concluded that, despite the\nnumber of regulatory approvals required in connection with the Merger, the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe. For more\ninformation, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Approvals\nRequired for the Merger\u201d. The Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the\nperiod during which Altra\u2019s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.\n \n\u2022\nBusiness Reputation of Regal Rexnord. The Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Regal Rexnord and its\nmanagement and the financial resources of Regal Rexnord, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Regal\nRexnord could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.\n \n\u2022\nNo Vote of Regal Rexnord Stockholders. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to the conditionality and execution\nrisk of any required approval by Regal Rexnord\u2019s shareholders.\n \n\u2022\nRegulatory Matters. The Board considered the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement Regal Rexnord would be required to take\nall actions to secure the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as to obtain the Other Regulatory\nApprovals, except that Regal Rexnord would not be required to take, proffer to, agree to, commit to, accept, or consent to, any Remedial\nAction if such Remedial Action, individually or together with other Remedial Actions, would or would reasonably be expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Regal Rexnord and its subsidiaries (including the\nCompany and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger but without giving effect to any Remedial Actions (with\nRegal Rexnord and its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole, measured for this purpose as being the\nsame size and having the same financial position and results of operations as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to\ngiving effect to the Merger and prior to giving effect to any Remedial Actions). For a detailed discussion of regulatory matters, please see\nbelow under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Efforts to Consummate the Merger\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:\n \n\u2022\nthat the Company may, subject to certain conditions, furnish, pursuant to entry into an acceptable confidentiality agreement,\nconfidential information with respect to the Company to third parties making an unsolicited proposal and participate in discussions or\nnegotiations with such third parties regarding unsolicited proposals that are made prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the\nMerger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation that the Company\u2019s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement prior\nto obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event,\nsubject to Regal Rexnord\u2019s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the Company Termination Fee of $100\nmillion\u037e\n \n43\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions\n(including payment of the Company Termination Fee and certain rights of Regal Rexnord to match the Superior Proposal)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe Board\u2019s belief, after discussion with Altra\u2019s advisors, that the Company Termination Fee, which constitutes approximately 2.5% of\nAltra\u2019s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a Superior Proposal from being made\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nthe Parent Termination Fee of $200 million that may be owed by Regal Rexnord to the Company in connection with the termination of\nthe Merger Agreement under specified regulatory related circumstances.\nFor a detailed discussion of the Merger Agreement, please see below under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Altra stockholders who comply with all of\nthe required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, including the fact that such\nstockholders will have the right to demand appraisal and payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery. For a detailed discussion of appraisal rights, please see below under the section entitled \u201c\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d.\n \n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. Altra\u2019s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Regal\nRexnord\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nOpportunity for Altra Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of Altra\nstockholders, and Altra stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at\nthe Special Meeting.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the Merger Agreement and\nthe Merger, including the following material factors:\n \n\u2022\nNo Participation in Altra\u2019s Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that if the Merger is consummated, stockholders of the\nCompany will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or\ngrowth of the Company or the combined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of Altra common stock,\nincluding any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other transactions.\n \n\u2022\nClosing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties\u2019 obligations to\nconsummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by Altra stockholders.\n \n\u2022\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s Business. The Board considered the effect of a public announcement of the Merger on the Company\u2019s\noperations, stock price and employees and its ability to attract and retain management, sales and other personnel while the Merger is\npending and the potential adverse effects on the financial and other results of the Company as a result of that disruption.\n \n\u2022\nNon-Solicitation Covenant. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the Company\u2019s solicitation of\nacquisition proposals from third parties and requires the Company to provide Regal Rexnord with an opportunity to propose in writing a\nbinding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement prior to the Company being able to terminate the Merger Agreement\nand accept a Superior Proposal, although the Board believes this would not preclude another potential acquiror from submitting a proposal\nto acquire the Company.\n \n\u2022\nCompany Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that the Company must pay Regal Rexnord the Company Termination Fee of\n$100 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain\n \n44\nTable of Contents\ncircumstances, including to accept a Superior Proposal, and that the amount of the Company Termination Fee is lower than termination fees\nin transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be paid unless the\nCompany entered into a more favorable transaction. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to the\nCompany Termination Fee were insisted upon by Regal Rexnord as a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement.\n \n\u2022\nInterim Operating Covenants. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its and its\nsubsidiaries\u2019 business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking\nbusiness opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger (as more fully described under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Conduct of Business Pending the Merger\u201d).\n \n\u2022\nRisk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the Merger might not be\nconsummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:\n \n\u2022\nAltra\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced\nsignificant distraction from their work during the pendency of the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nAltra will have incurred significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the Merger,\nmany of which will be payable even if the Merger is not completed\u037e\n \n\u2022\nAltra\u2019s continuing business relationships with personnel, customers, distributors, suppliers and other business parties may be\nadversely affected\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe trading price of shares of Altra common stock will change to the extent that the current price reflects assumptions regarding the\ncompletion of the Merger\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perceptions of Altra\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected, which may lead to subsequent offers to acquire the\nCompany at a lower price or otherwise on less favorable terms to Altra and its stockholders than contemplated by the Merger\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nAltra could lose senior management or other personnel during the pendency of the Merger.\n \n\u2022\nRegulatory Matters. The Board considered the regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate the Merger, the prospects for\nreceiving such approvals and the possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all due to a failure to obtain\nsuch approvals.\n \n\u2022\nPotential Future Share Price. The possibility that, although the Merger provides the Company\u2019s stockholders the opportunity to realize a\npremium to the price at which Altra common stock traded prior to the Board\u2019s approval of the Merger, the price of Altra common stock might\nhave increased in the future to a price greater than the Merger Consideration.\n \n\u2022\nTiming Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that completion of the Merger\ndepends on factors outside of Altra\u2019s or Regal Rexnord\u2019s control (including the approval of the Merger by Altra stockholders and certain\ngovernmental authorities) and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the\nexecution of the Merger Agreement could divert Altra management\u2019s attention and have an adverse impact on Altra, including its customer,\ndistributor, supplier and other business relationships.\n \n\u2022\nLitigation Risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the Merger.\n \n45\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nTax Treatment. The Board considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration payable in the Merger will generally be taxable to\nstockholders of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. The Board believed that this was mitigated by the fact that the\nentire consideration payable in the Merger would be cash, providing adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.\n \n\u2022\nOther Risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the Merger and the business of the Company, as more fully\ndescribed below in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nThe Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits\nof the Merger.\nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of Altra\u2019s directors and executive officers have\ninterests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Altra stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered\nthem at the time it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to Altra stockholders. For more information, please see the section of\nthis proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Interests of Altra\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d. The foregoing discussion of the information and\nfactors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board. In\nview of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise\nassign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have\ngiven different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or\nany particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its unanimous recommendation on the\ntotality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information\npresented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled\n\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.",

The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger\nAgreement and recommend that Altra stockholders vote their Altra common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nTreatment of Company Equity-Based Awards\nAt the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows:\n \n\u2022\neach outstanding Company Option that is vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be\ncanceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the number of shares of Altra common stock\nsubject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration\nover the exercise price per share of such Company Option\u037e provided that any such Company Option with an exercise price per share that is\nequal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled for no consideration\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach outstanding Company Option that is unvested, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or portion thereof, will be converted into\nan award of stock options to purchase a number of Parent common shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the\nnumber of shares of Altra\n \n55Table of Contents\ncommon stock subject to such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award\nConversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per share of such\nCompany Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio.

The amounts reflected in the table below exclude any grants that may be made following\nNovember 17, 2022 and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance with their terms\nprior to December 31, 2022 (the assumed date of the completion of the Merger solely for purposes of this transaction-related compensation disclosure).\nCompany Options are valued based on the difference between the per-share exercise price of such Company Option and the Merger Consideration of\n$62.00 per share. As a result, any Company Option included in the table below that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger\nConsideration does not have any value for purposes of the table below.

As a result, as of December 31, 2022, each non-employee director will have received all four annual\ninstallments and, therefore, none of the directors will hold outstanding and unvested equity awards.\nSeverance Entitlements\nEach of the executive officers entered into a Change of Control Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2015 (or, in the case of Mr. Patriacca, February\n8, 2022) with the Company (the \u201cCIC Agreements\u201d). Each CIC Agreement provides for severance payments and other benefits in the event of a\n\u201cqualifying termination\u201d, which generally means a termination of employment by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d within the ninety 90 day period prior to a\nchange in control that is in connection with or in anticipation of such change in control at the request of, or upon the initiative of, the buyer in the change\nin control transaction), or by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as described below) within the 24-month period\nfollowing, a change in control of Altra. The Merger will constitute a change in control of Altra for purposes of the CIC Agreements. For purposes of the\nCIC Agreements, \u201cgood reason\u201d generally means (i) without the executive\u2019s express consent, any material change in the executive\u2019s job title, any\nsignificant change in the executive\u2019s reporting relationships or a significant reduction of the executive\u2019s duties, position or responsibilities relative to the\nexecutive\u2019s duties, position or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or the executive\u2019s removal from such position, duties and\nresponsibilities, unless the executive is provided with comparable duties, position and responsibilities, (ii) a material reduction by the Company (other\nthan a reduction on the same basis as other senior executives) in the kind or level of employee benefits to which the executive is entitled immediately prior\nto such reduction with the result that the executive\u2019s overall benefits package is significantly reduced, (iii) a relocation that is more than 50 miles from the\nexecutive\u2019s then-current principal work location or (iv) the Company\u2019s failure to cause executive\u2019s employment agreement and its obligations thereunder\nto be expressly assumed by Company\u2019s successor.\nIn the event of a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d, each executive officer would be entitled to receive: (i) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of\n(x) the executive\u2019s applicable multiple (which is 3 in the case of Mr. Christenson and 2 in the case of all other executive officers) and (y) the sum of (a) the\nexecutive\u2019s annual base salary and (b) the executive\u2019s target annual cash bonus\u037e (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus for the portion of the\n \n58\nTable of Contents\nyear in which the termination occurs (with the proration based on the executive\u2019s date of termination)\u037e and (iii) subsidized health and dental COBRA\npremiums for up to 18 months. Receipt of the above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the applicable executive officer executing a\nrelease of claims in favor of the Company. In addition, upon an executive officer\u2019s \u201cqualifying termination\u201d all outstanding and unvested equity awards\nwould accelerate and vest in full.\nThe CIC Agreements provide that in the event that any payment or benefit (regardless of whether payable under the CIC Agreement or otherwise\nand including the acceleration of equity awards) payable to an executive officer would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section\n280G of the Code, then such payment or benefit will be reduced below the limit under Section 280G of the Code if the executive officer would end up in a\nbetter financial position than receiving the full amount and paying the 20% excise tax (such reduction, a \u201c280G best-net cutback\u201d). The CIC Agreements\ndo not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.\nPlease see the section below entitled \u201cQuantification of Payments and Benefits\u201d for a summary of the amounts payable to the Company\u2019s executive\nofficers pursuant to the terms of the CIC Agreements.\nContinuing Employee Benefits\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement, for a period of not less than one year following\nthe Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who was an employee of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (a \u201ccontinuing employee\u201d), subject to such individual\u2019s continued employment, with (i) a base salary\nor wage rate, target annual cash bonus and long-term incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable than such continuing employee\u2019s\nbase salary or wage rate, target annual cash bonus and long-term incentive opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)\nseverance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect\nto any provisions relating to a change in control) and (iii) other compensation and benefits (other than base salary, wage rate, bonus and long-term\nincentive opportunities, change in control and severance payments) that have a value that is substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to\nsuch continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nParent has agreed to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize a continuing employee\u2019s service with the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes, including determining such continuing employee\u2019s eligibility to participate, level of benefits and\nvesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, under benefit plans in which continuing employees will participate after the Effective Time\n(subject to certain exceptions), (ii) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods applicable to\ncontinuing employees under the Parent\u2019s, or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s, or any of their respective subsidiaries\u2019 welfare plans to be waived, to the extent\nsuch limitations were waived or satisfied prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide continuing employees with credit under any such welfare plan for any\nco-payments, deductibles or similar payments incurred during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.\nWith respect to annual bonuses payable under the Company\u2019s annual bonus plan during the fiscal year in which the closing of the Merger occurs,\nParent has agreed to pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay pro-rated bonuses equal to the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the\nnumber of days in the calendar year in which the closing of the Merger occurs that have elapsed as of the closing of the Merger, and the denominator of\nwhich is 365, and (ii) the amount of the applicable continuing employee\u2019s target bonus or, if greater, the bonus he or she would be entitled to receive\nbased on actual performance.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the Company may establish a retention and transaction bonus program for the benefit of employees and\nother service providers of the Company and any of its subsidiaries, make\n \n59\nTable of Contents\nindividual awards thereunder and enter into individual award agreements\u037e provided that under such programs the aggregate amount payable cannot\nexceed $19.7 million ($13.7 million of which will be used for individual awards to employees below the named executive officer level (the \u201cGeneral Pool\u201d)\nand the remaining $6 million of which may be granted to the named executive officers if, despite mitigation efforts, such executives will receive \u201cexcess\nparachute payments\u201d (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code)). The named executive officers are not eligible to receive a retention\naward from the General Pool.\nDirector Compensation\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board will continue to receive cash and equity retainers in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, provided that the Company may pay any unpaid cash retainer for the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time occurs without proration.  \nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing\nindemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies immediately following the completion of the Merger. For a more\ndetailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy\nstatement entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification and Insurance\u201d.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers estimates of the\namounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger and that will or may become payable to the named executive officer either\nimmediately at the Effective Time (i.e., on a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or following the\ncompletion of the Merger (i.e., on a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis). The holders of shares of Altra common stock are being asked to approve, on a non-binding,\nadvisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be\nbinding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of shares\nof Altra common stock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such\ncompensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under \u201c\u2014Interests of\nthe Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (a)\nan assumption that the Merger is completed on December 31, 2022, (b) a per share Merger Consideration of $62.00, (c) the named executive officers\u2019 salary\nand total eligible bonus levels as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and\nCompany PSUs held by the named executive officers as of November 17, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of\nthis proxy statement, and excluding any additional grants that may occur following such date and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company\nPSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance with their terms prior to December 31, 2022, and (e) an assumption that each named executive\nofficer (other than Mr. Storch) is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the named executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each, as defined in the\nCIC Agreement) immediately following the completion of the Merger. In addition, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple\nassumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before the completion of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may\nmaterially differ from the amounts set forth below. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may accelerate the payment of the Company\nPSUs granted in 2020, which will vest in the ordinary course on December 31, 2022 based on actual performance, and settle such awards in early\nDecember 2022.\n \n60\nTable of Contents\nThe amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section 280G best-net cutback\u037e therefore,\nactual payments to the named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below.\nGolden Parachute Payments to Named Executive Officers\n \nName\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits\n($)(3)\nOther\n($)\nTotal ($)\nCarl Christenson\n7,365,620\n15,211,568\n48,000\n0\n22,625,188\nChristian Storch(4)\n0\n1,465,885\n0\n0\n1,465,885\nGlenn Deegan\n1,703,160\n2,755,216\n48,000\n0\n4,506,376\nTodd Patriacca\n1,817,000\n1,504,027\n48,000\n0\n3,369,027\nCraig Schuele\n1,263,108\n1,585,624\n48,000\n0\n2,896,732\n \n(1)\nThe estimated amounts shown in this column represent (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the executive\u2019s applicable multiple\n(which is 3 in the case of Mr. Christenson and 2 in the case of all other named executive officers) and (2) the sum of (x) the named executive officer\u2019s\nannual base salary and (y) the named executive officer\u2019s target annual cash bonus and (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination,\nassuming a termination date of December 31, 2022.

The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of Altra\ncommon stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to\nreceive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights\npursuant to Section 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive\npursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Altra common stock following\npetition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Altra\ncommon stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled\nto receive pursuant to the\n \n63Table of Contents\nMerger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set\nforth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of\nSection 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such\nrights.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.

Any person who desires to\nexercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting\nto exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons seek to\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of a\nperson\u2019s appraisal rights under the DGCL.

Such notice must include either a copy of\nSection 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without\nsubscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nMerger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Altra common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to the\nCompany a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Altra common stock before the taking of the vote on the Merger, which demand must\nreasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Altra common stock for which appraisal is demanded and, for beneficial owners\nonly, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such\ndocumentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to\nreceive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List\u037e you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement\u037e you must hold your shares of Altra common stock continuously through the Effective Time\u037e and you must comply with the other\napplicable requirements of Section 262.\n \n64\nTable of Contents\nAn Altra stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the following address:\nAltra Industrial Motion Corp.\n300 Granite Street, Suite 201\nBraintree, MA 02184\nAttention: Glenn Deegan, Chief Legal Officer and Human Resources Officer\nwith a copy to (which shall not constitute notice):\nCravath, Swaine & Moore LLP\nWorldwide Plaza\n825 Eighth Avenue\nNew York, NY 10019\nAttention:\nThomas E. Dunn\nDaniel J. Cerqueira\nA record holder who holds shares of Altra common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In\nsuch case, the demand must set forth the number of shares of Altra common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of Altra\ncommon stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Altra common stock outstanding in the name of such record\nowner.\nWithin ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each of (a)\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and (b) the beneficial owners who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger\nConsideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person\u2019s shares of Altra common stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation and any person who has properly and\ntimely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court,\nwith a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of\nAltra common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the Surviving\nCorporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation\nwill not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Altra common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to\nhave their shares of Altra common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time\nperiods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as\nprovided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger\nConsideration under the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions\nof Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares\nof Altra common stock not voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and\nthe aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be given within\n \n65\nTable of Contents\nten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for\nthe delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving\nCorporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a\nduly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Altra common stock and with whom\nthe Surviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by\nthe Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving\nCorporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will determine which persons have\ncomplied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have\ndemanded an appraisal of their shares of Altra common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of\nAltra common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person fails to comply with\nsuch direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. The Delaware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all\nholders of shares of Altra common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of Altra common stock or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds\n$1 million.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its\ndiscretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the\nChancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court, including\nany rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of Altra\ncommon stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the\njudgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving\nCorporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (1)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Altra common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (2)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\nWhen the fair value of the shares of Altra common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such value, with interest\nthereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or\nthe same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any\nperson exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the\nrelevant shares of Altra common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.\n \n66\nTable of Contents\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated\nthat in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the\nmerged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass\nknown elements of value\u201d, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In\nWeinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are\nknown or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have\ndecided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable\nin the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and expert\nwitness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred\nexpenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Altra common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant\nto Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by\nthe Delaware Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares of Altra\ncommon stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions\npayable to Altra stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval\nmay be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to\nthe Delaware Court made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nterms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one\nhundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become\nentitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will\ngovern.",

This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of Altra common stock as\n\u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (generally, property held for\ninvestment). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a\nposition contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion.

This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as\nthe federal estate or gift tax, any\n \n69\nTable of Contents\nalternative minimum tax, or the application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code) or any state, local or non-U.S.\nincome or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations in respect of any withholding required\npursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental\nagreements entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This discussion\ndoes not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the Merger.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of\nAltra common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the\nactivities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of\nAltra common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR ALTRA\nSTOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE ALTRA STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR\nTAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME,\nALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Altra common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n \n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under\nthe laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n \n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source\u037e or\n \n\u2022\na trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more\n\u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust\nvalidly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Altra common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Altra common\nstock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Altra common stock will generally equal the amount that\nsuch U.S. Holder paid for such shares. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Altra common stock generally will be characterized as\ncapital gain or loss, and any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is\nmore than one year at the time of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain\n \n70\nTable of Contents\nnon-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Altra common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder\nmust determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Altra common stock that it holds.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nIn general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S. Holder in exchange for shares\nof Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n \n\u2022\nthe gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. Holder in\nthe United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. Holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the\nUnited States)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthe non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain\nother conditions are met\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nshares of Altra common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of Altra\u2019s status as a \u201cUnited States real property\nholding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of the five-year\nperiod ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of Altra common stock (the\n\u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in substantially the same\nmanner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be\nprovided by an applicable income tax treaty) on its \u201ceffectively connected earnings and profits\u201d for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.\nA non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate\nas may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which generally may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-\nU.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year (if any), provided the non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such\nlosses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, Altra believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the five-year period ending on\nthe date of the Effective Time. Even if Altra is or was a USRPHC during the Relevant Period, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder\u2019s receipt of cash in\nexchange for shares of Altra common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Altra common stock is \u201cregularly\ntraded\u201d, as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively,\n5% or less of the Altra common stock throughout the Relevant Period.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders in connection\nwith the Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nthe U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct\ntaxpayer identification number and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and\notherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.\n \n71\nTable of Contents\nA non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) unless the non-U.S. Holder\nprovides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS\nForm W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or a non-U.S. Holder generally\nwill be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder\u2019s or non-U.S. Holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-\nU.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY\nVARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS\nOR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME,\nALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.",

However, we cannot predict the exact timing of completion of the Merger\nbecause we cannot guarantee when all of the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.\nU.S. Regulatory Clearances\nUnder the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or been terminated. A\ntransaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the\n \n72Table of Contents\nexpiration of a 30-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission (the\n\u201cFTC\u201d) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (a\n\u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run\nonly after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree\nto extend the waiting period. The parties made the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on November 9, 2022. Regal Rexnord withdrew its filing on\nDecember 9, 2022, and refiled as of December 13, 2022, such that the initial 30-day waiting period is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nJanuary 12, 2023.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the\nFTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nIn addition to the HSR Act, the consummation of the Merger is also subject to receipt of consents, approvals or other clearances under (a) the\nantitrust laws of Australia, China, the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom, (b) the investment screening laws of Australia, the Czech\nRepublic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, (c) the investment screening laws of certain specified jurisdictions, to the extent such\nlaws enter into force prior to Closing and Parent determines in accordance with terms set forth in the confidential disclosure schedules that approval is\nrequired under such laws and (d) the investment screening laws of a specified jurisdiction if, prior to the Effective Time, the applicable governmental\nauthority in such jurisdiction requests Parent to provide notice of the Merger (collectively, the \u201cOther Regulatory Approvals\u201d).\nAs of December 13, 2022, the parties submitted filings, or drafts thereof, with the applicable governmental authorities under (a) the antitrust laws of\nChina and Turkey and (b) the investment screening laws of Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.\nIn each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable,\nincluding seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement Proposal.\n \n73\nTable of Contents",
